SRI LANKA:49.5 49.5 Starc to Mathews, out Caught by Christian!! Gone! Oh dear, the nail-biter ends with disappointment for Angelo Mathews and Sri Lanka. This was a ball to be hit - right in the slot around off, Mathews got into good position, went deep back in the crease and slapped it with a flat bat but could not get the timing right, ended up skying it high to long on where Christian setlled under it. Mathews looks terribly disappointed, and the Australians celebrate - more in relief than joy. Mathews c Christian b Starc 64(76) [4s-4 6s-1] Starc to Mathews, THATS OUT!! Caught!!6 from 2 now. Excitement building up.
SRI LANKA:49.4  Starc to Dhammika, 1 run, quick single and he gets there! Takes a step forward and takes it on the full, steers it straight to point and runs across, Ponting was the fielder and he was quick but the throw hit Dhammika7 from 3 now. Clarke is making some changes in the field. Mathews walks up to Dhammika and has a few words.. "all three results are possible" : another age old saying.
SRI LANKA:49.3  Starc to Mathews, 1 run, full and straight, Mathews throws his bat at it and strikes it well, but along the ground to deep mid wicket, just a single and the strike is with Dhammika now
SRI LANKA:49.2  Starc to Mathews, SIX, and a SIX now! What a strike that! Starc compensates for the short one with a half volley, Mathews takes a stride forward and slams it cleanly over long off.. punches the air after hitting it. 8 from 4 is very gettable.. this is terrific from Mathews!
SRI LANKA:49.1  Starc to Mathews, FOUR, 4 off the first ball! Perfect start to the last over. Oh god, are we in for a thriller?! Short ball on middle stump, Mathews pulls it hard and gets it to the vacant deep mid wicket region, Mike Hussey runs across and dives but the ball just touches the ropes. Nervous times for Australia!18 runs from the last over now. Age old saying: anything can happen in cricket. Another age old saying: cricket is a funny game. All these will be apt if Sri Lanka manage to get there.
SRI LANKA:48.6  Clint McKay to Dhammika, 2 runs, well done Dhammika! Not only has he got 2, he has also given the strike back to Mathews. Flicks this one off the pads to mid wicket region and runs hard to make it 2
SRI LANKA:48.5  Clint McKay to Dhammika, no run, swing and a miss! But that was close to being called wide. Slower one well outside off, Dhammika walks across and slogs but cannot get bat on ball

SRI LANKA:48.2  Clint McKay to Dhammika, 1 run, sensible stuff from Dhammika. Defends this slower ball softly to the on side and gives the strike to Mathews, very good stuff
SRI LANKA:48.1  Clint McKay to Dhammika, 2 runs, 4 or 2? Looks like a 2. Dhammika lofts this slower one over the bowler's head, Christian runs across from long off, he was outside the boundary rope but was in the air when he flicked it back into play, so just 226 runs from 2 overs. Dhammika on strike..
SRI LANKA:47.6  Starc to Dhammika, 1 run, Dhammika retains strike with a single to third man, guides this short one to the man there, he wants 2 but the fielding is sharp
SRI LANKA:47.5  Starc to Dhammika, FOUR, good shot that! He pulled a short ball for 3 early in the over, and this time he drives this full ball straight down the ground for four. Makes good use of the half-volley and splits mid off and the bowler
SRI LANKA:47.4  Starc to Mathews, 1 run, FIFTY up for Angelo Mathews. His 9th in ODIs, gets there with a whip shot to mid wicket. A good knock from him but he had absolutely no support from his teammates

SRI LANKA:47.2  Starc to Mathews, 1 run, direct hit and Dhammika would have been a goner. Mathews drives this hard to extra cover and runs, Warner swoops in and goes for the stumps at the striker's end but misses, Dhammika was not even in picture

SRI LANKA:46.3  Clint McKay to Mathews, 2 runs, excellent fielding, Mathews finally makes contact and slogs it high wide of long off, it seemed to be headed to the fence but Dan Christian ran across and dived to flick the ball back into play, saves a couple
SRI LANKA:46.2  Clint McKay to Mathews, no run, I am not going to repeat commentary. Another slower ball, another cut shot, another miss. McKay smiles and Mathews has a stunned look on his face
SRI LANKA:46.1  Clint McKay to Mathews, no run, McKay bowls a slower ball. Absolutely no surprises there. Mathews looks for a square cut but plays early and misses again... deja vu!

He had to put in a dive which he didThird umpire called for a run out appeal. Mathews seems to be safe.Mitchell Starc [7.0-0-20-1] is back into the attack. He bowled a fine spell early on in the innings. Can he finish it off?

SRI LANKA:41.6  Doherty to Senanayake, out Stumped!! Well, the pressure created by the dot balls has dismissed Senanayake. That shows the difference between a proper batsman and a tail-ender. Charges down the track and throws his bat it, fails to make contact and Wade has all the time in the world to stump him. An important wicket that, as the partnership was starting to frustrate Australia. Senanayake st Wade b Doherty 9(24) Doherty to Senanayake, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!

This was flat and angled in on the pads, Chandimal stays back and looks to work it across but misses and gets hit in front of middle and leg. I guess that would have gone on to clip leg stump (and hawk eye says the same) so it's not too bad a decision. Sri Lanka are falling apart.

Our cricket has been positive and we have to give our best to play. We are playing the same team that played against India. Warner has been able to play the switch-hit and he is an amazing talent.Mahela: This is a fresh pitch. I am not sure of the total that is needed to win here. The youngsters are excited to be playing in Australia and they are taking the challenge on. Senanayake is playing today.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to fieldSome stats: Ravi Shastri has the best bowling figures in an ODI at Perth. He picked up 5/15 against Australia in 1991.Pitch Report: The pitch is hard and there is some dry grass on this track. There will be good bounce generated and the fast bowlers will enjoy bowling on this track.Welcome to the 3rd ODI of the CB series between Australia and Sri Lanka from Perth. Australia were in great form during their game against India and they will look to do well against SL today. The Lankans, on the other hand, will be looking to get their campaign back on track after suffering a loss in the previous match against India.Preview by Vishaal LoganathanAustralia will look to continue their recent dominant form when they take on the troubled Sri Lankans at Perth. The former 4 time World Champions already have an impressive win in their bag, trumping the Indians in the series opener and they look overwhelming favourites to consign the Lankans to another defeat.Australia:Australia go into the game with their confidence sky high and with their form at its peak. The hosts had a good outing in the first game against India but still will have a few wrongs to be ironed out especially in the batting department. Their bowling is filled with variety and they will lose no sleep regarding their bowlers.Australia only worry will be how their top order capitulated against India. David Warner, Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke(Australia's most consistent batsmen in the Test series) fell cheaply and Australia will hope that all three failing in a single match was a mere coincidence. The Australians had Matthew Wade and the Hussey brothers to thank for bailing their team out of trouble. Wade has been superb at the top of the order and will be key if Australia decide to rest Warner and welcome debutant Peter Forrest, Daniel Christian also could be rested but that would mean Forrest would come much lower down the order.Their bowling though will not have much to worry about as they came up with a top drawer performance in the 1st ODI. Another similar performance would put them in a fantastic position to get 2 wins under their belt and their bowlers will be raring to have a go at the Lankans.Sri Lanka:Sri Lanka were left to rue their decision to not include a specialist spinner against India and the Islanders will want to ensure they do not repeat the same mistake again. Sri Lanka will have the advantage of having played at the ground only 2 days ago but they will know they have to improve a lot if they are to challenge the rampaging Australian team.The Sri Lankan batting line up fared much better than what we have come to expect over the past few months with most of their top batsmen getting off to good starts. But they will be bitterly disappointed with how they threw it away after working hard to get their eye in. Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene all perished after making good starts and they will be doubly determined to set it right this time. Dinesh Chandimal has been a real star in the recent past and he continued his good form against India, another good performance against the hosts will go a long way in cementing his place in the ODI squad.On the bowling front, Sri Lanka will look to include Rangana Herath in place of one of the seamers or even in place of a batsman(most likely Lahiru Thirimanne). The amount of purchase the Indians managed to extract will be an encouraging sign for the Islanders and they will look to use that to their advantage. Lasith Malinga, Sri Lanka's trump card, looked out of sorts against India and will be keen to set the record straight in this game.Final Word:Australia will be keen to extend their dominance and the will expect nothing less than a handsome win, while Sri Lanka will want to do everything in their power to ensure they don't suffer a second straight defeat in the tournament and leave themselves with too much to do.
