INDIA:11.2  Andre Russell to Raina, out Caught by Darren Bravo!! Soft dismissal, and India are 59-5! Fullish delivery on the off, Raina gets forward and drives it, he seemed to check his shot a bit there, and ended up hitting uppishly to mid off where Bravo takes a low catch. Russell is overjoyed - he roars in delight. Everyone in Cuttack could have heard that roar - there is complete silence now.

INDIA:9.4  Andre Russell to Raina, 1 run, predictable short one to Raina, he hops back and works it to fine leg for one. Off the mark immediatelySuresh Raina, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:9.3 Andre Russell to Sehwag, out Bowled!! This was always coming. He started well but was clearly distracted by the jaywalking near the sightscreen. But what a ball - fast, pitching just outside off and nipping back in sharply, Sehwag is not known for his foot movements and has a HUGE gap between bat and pad as he drives on the up, turns back to see his middle stump uprooted. Russell is celebrating the way Allan Donald did after getting Sachin Tendulkar bowled in Durban, in 1997. Sehwag b Andre Russell 20(29) [4s-3] Andre Russell to Sehwag, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:9.2  Andre Russell to Sehwag, no run, another pacy delivery on the off stump channel, Sehwag is half forward half back and pushes it back to Russell

INDIA:8.5  Roach to Rohit Sharma, no run, good length delivery on the off, he stays back and defends
INDIA:8.4  Roach to Sehwag, 1 run, risky run! The last thing India need now is a run out. Sehwag punches this one straight to cover, the fielder misfields and he spots an opportunity for one, Rohit Sharma responds and would have been in some trouble if it was a direct hit. Sehwag still manages to find reasons to smile
INDIA:8.3  Roach to Sehwag, no run, well directed bouncer, bangs it in short on middle stump, Sehwag does well to get under it
INDIA:8.2  Roach to Sehwag, no run, nips in and skids on from good length spot, Sehwag is hopping in his crease and is hit on the pads, he is not looking too comfortable out there
INDIA:8.1  Roach to Sehwag, no run, short of length and on the off, he stays back and blocks itCrowd trouble incident: the fielder involved was Hyatt. The pouch of water landed just near his foot. Immediately after the incident, he went back to signing autographs to the ball boys. That's nice.
INDIA:7.6  Andre Russell to Rohit Sharma, no run, pitched up around off, Rohit Sharma gets forward and punches it to mid off
INDIA:7.5  Andre Russell to Rohit Sharma, no run, short and rising outside off, he cuts it to point
INDIA:7.4  Andre Russell to Rohit Sharma, no run, full and straight, he stays in the crease and pushes it to mid wicketMore problems, and this is pretty ugly I reckon. Looks like someone from the crowd has thrown something at a West Indies fielder. Sammy, the umpires and a few fielders have a mid-pitch conference. What a shame! Just when we were praising the Cuttack crowd for the turnout today, this happens. Shirshendu Roy informs us that it was a pouch of water which was hurled at a fielder. Anyways, it's all over now. Back with the game.Sehwag is not happy with people moving behind the sightscreen. He has a word with the umpire.
INDIA:7.3  Andre Russell to Sehwag, leg byes, 1 run, fullish and angled in, goes off the pads to square leg for a leg bye
INDIA:7.2  Andre Russell to Sehwag, no run, lazy from Sehwag, but he stays on. Skids on and nips in from good length area, Sehwag was caught in the crease and takes an eternity to get his bat down, it thuds into the pads and rolls to the on side

INDIA:6.3  Roach to Virat Kohli, out Bowled!! The new bat hasn't helped, and Roach is on a roll. It is his 50th ODI wicket, and he is running across in joy. Superb delivery that - fast, pitches on good length around off and nips in sharply, Kohli pushes at it but the ball manages to sneak in through the gate to hit off stump. 3 in 3 for Roach, India need some stability. Virat Kohli b Roach 3(6) Roach to Virat Kohli, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Slight delay in play. Kohli is changing his bat. Rahane runs in with a few options.
INDIA:6.2  Roach to Virat Kohli, no run, short of length and just around off, Kohli stays back and blocks
INDIA:6.1  Roach to Virat Kohli, 2 runs, nice shot for a couple, full and on the middle and leg, he whips it between mid wicket and mid on for a coupleShirshendu Roy, our man at the ground says that the noise is absolutely deafening out there. It's dewy for sure and that is why Sammy wants to bowl as many overs of Martin as soon as possible. However, that plan has backfired as Sehwag is in murderous form.
INDIA:5.6  Andre Russell to Sehwag, no run, almost a mix up! Sehwag defends this one straight to point, and for some reason Kohli was charging across towards the striker's end, he realises pretty late that his skipper doesn't want the single, but has just about enough time to get back
INDIA:5.5  Andre Russell to Virat Kohli, 1 run, short delivery on the middle stump, Kohli doesn't like short ones but this time he handles it well, rocks back and pulls to deep backward square leg, where Martin runs across and keeps it to one
INDIA:5.4  Andre Russell to Sehwag, 1 run, quick single, pushes this one uppishly to mid on and runs across for a sharp run
INDIA:5.3  Andre Russell to Sehwag, no run, an appeal for caught behind from Ramdin, but Russell doesn't join him. Very good delivery that, hits the right length just outside off, Sehwag doesn't move his feet but pushes at it and gets beaten. There was some sound, but it was bat hitting pad
INDIA:5.2  Andre Russell to Sehwag, no run, tight delivery, good length and on middle, Sehwag pays respect and defends from the creaseDelay in play. Some people decide it is a good time to go for a walk behind the bowler's arm. Sehwag isn't impressed, and he isn't going to bat until they get to their seats.
INDIA:5.1  Andre Russell to Sehwag, no run, the free hit doesn't cost much. Full and just outside off, Sehwag looks to drive through the off side but the bat turns in his hands, ends up mistiming it to mid off

INDIA:4.5  Roach to Virat Kohli, no run, another short one, but it is well directed this time, Kohli hops back and blocks
INDIA:4.5  Roach to Virat Kohli, wide, that's pretty harsh. Good delivery that, a hostile bouncer but just a bit down the leg, Kohli was hurried on by the pace but manages to duck under itVirat Kohli, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:4.4  Roach to Gambhir, out Caught by Ramdin!! Oh boy, I wasn't sure he was serious with the plan of bowling short and wide, but he has got 2 wickets in the over already. This time he gives even more width, Gambhir is tempted into the shot and looks to play the cut again, but the ball rises a bit more than he expects and takes the edge to Ramdin. All of a sudden, India are in some trouble. Gambhir c Ramdin b Roach 4(3) [4s-1] Roach to Gambhir, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:4.3  Roach to Gambhir, FOUR!!, nice shot to get off the mark. Short and wide outside off again, he probably thinks he can get Gambhir like the way he dismissed Parthiv, but Gambhir cuts uppishly and helps it over cover for a boundary
INDIA:4.2  Roach to Gambhir, no run, full and straight delivery to the new comer, Gambhir stays in the crease and defendsGautam Gambhir, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:4.1  Roach to Parthiv Patel, out Caught by Anthony Martin!! Not the best of deliveries but he gets the wicket. Short and very wide outside off, too inviting for Parthiv who looks to cut it away - mind you he is pretty strong through that area - but this time he hits it uppishly to point, where Martin dives forward to take a good, low catch. West Indies needed that badly. Parthiv Patel c Anthony Martin b Roach 12(13) [4s-2] Roach to Parthiv Patel, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:3.6  Anthony Martin to Sehwag, FOUR!!, and another one! This time Anthony Martin adjusts by tossing it up and bowling it fuller, Sehwag comes on the frontfoot and smashes it over mid off
INDIA:3.5  Anthony Martin to Sehwag, FOUR!!, this time he gets it right. Short and a bit wide outside off, enough width for Sehwag to unleash a hard flash, he gets good bat on it and places it wide of short third man to collect four
INDIA:3.4  Anthony Martin to Sehwag, no run, aggression from Sehwag, but doesn't get it right. Comes forward and looks to go over the off side but he isn't upto the pitch of it, ends up mistiming it uppishly but just short of the bowler himself
INDIA:3.3  Anthony Martin to Sehwag, no run, flat and skiddy on the off, Sehwag makes room and punches it to point, Parthiv Patel wants a single and comes charging down but Sehwag sends him back
INDIA:3.2  Anthony Martin to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, holds back the length a bit, Parthiv goes back and drills it to long on
INDIA:3.1  Anthony Martin to Parthiv Patel, FOUR!!, too easy. This is very poor bowling. He has a square leg and a short fine leg, and gifts a fullish one on the pads, Parthiv is strong on the leg side and all he has to do is sweep it away, which he does over square leg
INDIA:2.6  Roach to Sehwag, no run, well bowled, bangs it in short right on middle stump, Sehwag was hopping and jumping but does well to keep it down to the ground, a better over from Roach
INDIA:2.5  Roach to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, he scores a lot of runs in that area, stays back and steers this one to third man for an easy single
INDIA:2.4  Roach to Parthiv Patel, no run, a bit of extra bounce from back of a length area, Parthiv stays in the crease and pushes it to cover
INDIA:2.3  Roach to Parthiv Patel, no run, good length delivery on the off, he stays forward to block it
INDIA:2.2  Roach to Sehwag, 1 run, poor bowling and poor running, Roach bowls this on the pads but luckily for him, Sehwag's flick shot doesn't have enough in it to go past fine leg, Barath is the fielder there and he has to cover quite a distance but the batsmen settle for just one
INDIA:2.1  Roach to Sehwag, no run, back of a length and on the off, Sehwag looks to punch it away but gets a thick inside edge to square leg
INDIA:1.6  Anthony Martin to Sehwag, 1 run, flat and straight to Sehwag, he stays back and pushes it to mid on for an easy single
INDIA:1.5  Anthony Martin to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, more flight on this one, Parthiv Patel turns it through mid wicket, brings Sehwag on strike
INDIA:1.4  Anthony Martin to Parthiv Patel, no run, quicker one on the leg and middle stump channel, Parthiv Patel pushes back to the bowler
INDIA:1.3  Anthony Martin to Parthiv Patel, FOUR!!, he missed out on the sweep a couple of balls earlier but not this time. Just can't bowl on the legs with square leg and fine leg inside the circle, but Martin does exactly that. Parthiv sweeps and gets a top edge, but has enough to clear the man at short fine leg
INDIA:1.2  Anthony Martin to Parthiv Patel, no run, better line and length, bowls this fast on middle stump, Parthiv stays in the crease and blocks
INDIA:1.2  Anthony Martin to Parthiv Patel, wide, slow, flat and way down the leg, would have been a boundary had Parthiv connected the sweep but luckily for the bowler, he didn't
INDIA:1.1  Anthony Martin to Parthiv Patel, no run, flat and full on the legs, Parthiv Patel works it to square legAnthony Martin, right-arm leg break, comes into the attack. So West Indies start with spin..interesting.
INDIA:0.6  Roach to Sehwag, no run, better from Roach, bowls this short and aims for the ribs, has Sehwag hopping and hits him high on the body. Expensive over from Roach ends
INDIA:0.5  Roach to Sehwag, 2 runs, more runs, back of a length and just outside off, Sehwag stays back and steers it between point and cover for a couple more
INDIA:0.4  Roach to Sehwag, 2 runs, pitched up this time, a lot straighter also, Sehwag gets half forward and pushes it through extra cover for a couple
INDIA:0.4  Roach to Sehwag, 5 wides, poor stuff from the bowler and the keeper. Roach sprays this down the leg, Sehwag can't get bat on to it but he wouldn't mind it, as the keeper Ramdin fails to get to it. More gifts from Roach
INDIA:0.3  Roach to Sehwag, no run, play and a miss! Not too short this time but Sehwag goes for a big flash through the off side, fails to make contact as the ball whizzes past him
INDIA:0.2  Roach to Sehwag, FOUR!!, mistake 1 - give a free hit. Mistake 2 - bowl it short. Result = 4 runs. It was a slower one, but Sehwag was ready for it, made some room and slashes it wide of third man for a boundary
INDIA:0.2  Roach to Parthiv Patel, no ball, 1 run, oversteps this time and bowls a shorter one, Parthiv Patel steers it wide of gully to third man. Free hit coming up, and Sehwag wouldn't mind that at all. Not sure he needs one though
INDIA:0.1  Roach to Parthiv Patel, no run, good start for Roach, full and just outside off, gets a bit of away movement as Parthiv leavesParthiv Patel and Sehwag are at the crease. Parthiv Patel is on strike. Roach will open the attackThe break is over. 212 doesn't look threatening, and India are the favourites to win this one. Sehwag is back in the blues; the last ODI game he played was the World Cup final in Mumbai.It has been a great effort by the bowlers. Vinay Kumar and Umesh Yadav snapped up the top three cheaply. Darren Bravo played wonderfully and shared a gritty 75 run partnership with Danza Hyatt. The spinners, led by Ashwin, maintained the pressure in the middle overs. Only 11 runs resulted in the Batting PP as West Indies lost wickets at regular intervals. Andre Russell struck some blows towards the end as West Indies ended up on 211/9. India will be favorites to chase this down. Join us 18:45 PM IST for the Indian innings.4

WEST INDIES:17.4  Aaron to Darren Bravo, FOUR!!, Bham! Class and power from Darren Bravo. Class for he opened the face to miss the cover fielder and power on that was pretty extraordinary. It went away at the rate of Ravi Shaz's tracer bullets and gave sweeper cover not an iota of a chance. Again hit on the up and the ball made a cracking sound as it left the bat. Aaron gets some advice from Vinay after that. What.A.Shot though.
WEST INDIES:17.3  Aaron to Darren Bravo, no run, firm cover drive, but straight to the fielder. That was hit hard on the up, but failed to find the gap

WEST INDIES:15.5  Aaron to Darren Bravo, wide, slips this down leg as the attempted slower delivery goes wrong
WEST INDIES:15.4  Aaron to Darren Bravo, FOUR!!, Murdered! Off the frontfoot. Rubbish ball - short and outside off, too much room for Darren Bravo who just belted it fiercely and it almost carried all the way. One bounce and over at deep cover. Darren Bravo didn't want to keep it down and gave it the full monty. The ball would've taken a beating for sure
WEST INDIES:15.3  Aaron to Hyatt, 1 run, edged through gully! Hyatt standing tall and trying to force it through the off side field and getting a thick edge. A gully would've caught it easily. Aaron was interested for a while, but there is no fielder at that position to catch that
WEST INDIES:15.2  Aaron to Hyatt, no run, Parthiv fumbles the take after Hyatt had shouldered arms. It doesn't cost India anything though

WEST INDIES:13.6  Vinay Kumar to Hyatt, no run, Absolute cracker. McGrathesque from Vinay Kumar. Swung in the air and then left Hyatt off the pitch. That's what the great Glenn used to do for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Vinay Kumar lands this on off and the ball just about seams away to miss the edge. If it had held it's line, Hyatt might well have nicked it. In the end he was left groping in utter hopelessness as the ball whizzed past the edge. Vinay Kumar has his hands on his head unable to believe how the laws of Physics have combined to deny him a wicket. What a peach!

WEST INDIES:9.6  Umesh Yadav to Simmons, out Bowled!! Harakiri from Simmons and he has thrown it away. A nothing shot from the Trinidadian - backs away and the ball is too full and too close to the stumps to attempt anything fancy. Simmons does just that and ends up bottom edging it back onto his stumps. Umesh Yadav as he always does claps in delight. Well deserved wicket for Umesh Yadav.

WEST INDIES:8.5  Aaron to Simmons, 1 run, that's the problem with Kohli. He has the tendency to throw even if there is no chance of a run-out. Here he does the same as well after picking up a flick from Simmons and throws at Darren Bravo's end. Darren Bravo is well in and mid off cannot stop it even as he dived. Raina cleans up and a single is gifted away.

Full and angling in on middle and leg, Marlon Samuels pushed at it lazily and the ball hit the pad before rolling back onto the stumps. Aaron is delighted and goes off on a celebratory run. WI are two down. First ball wicket for Aaron. Marlon Samuels b Aaron 10(11) [4s-2] Aaron to Marlon Samuels, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Varun Aaron, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
WEST INDIES:7.6  Umesh Yadav to Simmons, 2 runs, just beyond the reach of Gauti running from mid off. Simmons is clearly looking to dominate and the short one is well above his chest and rising into his head area, he backs away and tries to swat it away, the ball hits the toe end of the bat and goes way up, Gauti runs back from mid off, but it falls just beyond his lunge. Would've needed a more athletic fielder to have had any chance of catching it. Still a good effort from Gambhir

WEST INDIES:6.4  Vinay Kumar to Marlon Samuels, no run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Marlon Samuels defends solidly
WEST INDIES:6.3  Vinay Kumar to Simmons, 1 run, full and outside off, Simmons goes hard at that and the ball flies off the outside edge through the vacant gully
WEST INDIES:6.2  Vinay Kumar to Simmons, SIX!!, now comes down the track and launches a flick with a flourish over deep mid wicket. Full panache from Simmons as he meets it well and the ball flies away over the ropes. A confirmation is needed and the third ump relays the decision back to the onfield umpire and it is a biggie. He is now 10 off 17 with those two hits
WEST INDIES:6.1  Vinay Kumar to Simmons, FOUR!!, What a way to get off the mark! 15 dots he has played and off the 16th, he has drilled one past Vinay Kumar.

WEST INDIES:5.6  Umesh Yadav to Marlon Samuels, no run, 145 KPH delivery from Umesh Yadav and Marlon Samuels moves closer to the line of that and then shoulders arms. It was outside off and jagged back in, but not enough to hit the off stump. Good leave in the end

WEST INDIES:5.4  Umesh Yadav to Marlon Samuels, no run, this one is on the stumps and Marlon Samuels has to defend
WEST INDIES:5.3  Umesh Yadav to Marlon Samuels, FOUR!!, that as an awkward shot.

Kohli tried to pull it back with a dive, but the ball kept on running away from him
WEST INDIES:5.2  Umesh Yadav to Marlon Samuels, no run, not all that short, but Marlon Samuels tries to manufacture a cut and ends up hitting it hard into the ground. Easy stop for Jadeja this time
WEST INDIES:5.1  Umesh Yadav to Marlon Samuels, no run, once again a good stop by RJ at point. Moved to his right and cut off a square cut by Marlon Samuels
WEST INDIES:4.6  Vinay Kumar to Simmons, no run, Simmons is still on 0 and this is the 15th delivery that he has faced. Pushed to cover again. He needs to get off that dreaded duck as quickly as possible

Clear edge and Vinay Kumar kept on pleading, before getting the decision in his favor. Lovely ball, full and on off, just the tiny bit of movement to catch the edge as Barath poked half heartedly from the crease. To be fair to Tony Hill, he might not have heard the edge amidst the din that the huge crowd is creating. Anyway the first blow has been struck by Vinay Kumar and a brilliant delivery to boot as well. Barath c Parthiv Patel b Vinay Kumar 17(13) [4s-3] Vinay Kumar to Barath, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

WEST INDIES:2.4  Vinay Kumar to Barath, 2 runs, leg stump ball and Barath works it wide of square leg for an easy couple of runs
WEST INDIES:2.3  Vinay Kumar to Barath, FOUR!!, the short ball rises high and Barath did extremely well to get on top of the bounce and flat bat a pull over mid on's head. Barath is a short man and he had to hop back and then get into a good position to play it. Mistimed, but still good enough to beat mid on
WEST INDIES:2.2  Vinay Kumar to Barath, no run, Rockstar Jadeja gets his first touch of the ball and it is a good save diving to his right at point. Raina goes up to him and has a congratulatory pat on his back. That was heading to the fence as Barath carved it well off the backfoot, but RJ flew to save a boundary. Top stuff!
WEST INDIES:2.1  Vinay Kumar to Barath, no run, tight lines these from Vinay Kumar, Barath crouches low to defend the off stump ball, was a bit squared up, but managed to play it without any alarms

WEST INDIES:1.4  Umesh Yadav to Barath, no run, Barath's bat comes down at an angle again. Is very late in getting it down and somehow does well to push it back to Umesh Yadav. That was pacy from Umesh who hit the bat hard.
WEST INDIES:1.3  Umesh Yadav to Barath, FOUR!!, Bash! Up and over cover. Short and wide outside off, Barath slashed it well over the off side field. One bounce and over the ropes. Hit extremely hard. Very poor ball though and rightly given the treatment

WEST INDIES:1.1  Umesh Yadav to Barath, 2 runs, Barath nearly trods onto his stumps as he goes deep into his crease to punch that wide of a diving Raina at cover.

Vinay Kumar will open the attackA huge crowd in anticipation for the first ODI. They are packed to the rafters and Vinay Kumar has the ball. Simmons to take strike. Here we go.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Lendl Simmons, Adrian Barath, Danza Hyatt, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Kieron Pollard, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy(c), Andre Russell, Anthony Martin, Kemar RoachIndia (Playing XI): Virender Sehwag(c), Parthiv Patel(w), Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Vinay Kumar, Varun Aaron, Umesh YadavSammy: We would have bowled as well. We have guys like Pollard who has played in India and can give us input. Russel is back, he had a good series against India back home so the team looks good. We have good variety in the bowling line up. Rampaul is rested for this game.Sehwag: We will bowl first. The dew factor has made us take the decision as we have some spinners. I am the oldest one in the side and we are looking forward to the series. Me and Parthiv will open. We have a young and a balanced side. We want the intensity to be high and I'm sure the youngsters will be up for this.India have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report: There will be enough bounce on this pitch. This pitch will also keep low. Sunil Gavaskar says that dew will be a factor. This pitch has plenty of runs written in it.India will be led by Virender Sehwag, who is playing his first ODI since the 2011 World Cup final. He will be leading a side that is minus Tendulkar and Dhoni. However, India have a good bunch of youngsters who have performed well recently.The Tests are done and now the focus shifts to the ODIs between India and the West Indies. The first ODI takes place at Cuttack. On current form, India are favorites against a West Indies side that has shown some fight. In the last three bilateral series between these two nations since 2007, India have emerged victorious on all three occasions. They would be looking to continue that trend while the West Indies would be desperate to reverse it. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Gokul GopalHaving taken the Test series 2-0, India will be looking to extend their dominance over West Indies in the five-match ODI series. But it will not be all that simple for the home team as West Indies displayed tremendous fighting spirit in the Test series and they will be hoping to come up with a similar effort in the ODIs.Head to Head: India's record against West Indies in ODIs at home is not all that impressive. The sub-continent team has played a total of 39 matches against the Caribbean side - winning 16 games while ending up on the losing side 23 times.Form guide - both teams in 2011: If one were to compare the performances of both teams in ODIs in this year, it is clear that the hosts have a upper hand. India are of course the World Champions in the 50-over format and apart from that, their ODI record this year is also pretty good. India have won a total of 17 matches out of the 29 played in 2011. They were also involved in two tied matches while one game yielded no result. West Indies, on the other hand, have won only 9 out of the 23 matches played this year, losing 13 games while one was a no result.India: The selectors have followed a rotational policy for a while now where some of the seniors have been given a break while youngsters have been provided with an opportunity. The current squad too has been balanced in such a way that there is a mix of youth and experience. While Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Sachin Tendulkar have been rested, Virender Sehwag, whose last ODI appearance was during the World Cup final, has been selected to lead the side. Dhoni's replacement Parthiv Patel is likely to open along with Sehwag while the the middle order displays solidity with the presence of Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina. With such quality batsmen in the line-up, youngsters like Ajinkya Rahane and Manoj Tiwary may not even get a chance to figure in the Indian eleven.The home team also has good all-rounders in Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin. The latter will be oozing with confidence after his excellent showing in the Test series during which he proved his prowess with the bat apart from a haul of 22 Test wickets in his debut series. The Jadeja-Ashwin duo will be India's main spin option while the likes of Raina, Sehwag and Rohit call also roll their arms over. India also have the option of including leg-spinner Rahul Sharma in the playing eleven. When it comes to pace, India have a relatively inexperienced attack with Praveen Kumar being ruled out of the opening ODI due to a chest injury. The likes of Umesh Yadav, Varun Aaron and Vinay Kumar will be expected to make light of Praveen's absence. Abhimanyu Mithun, the replacement for Praveen Kumar, will give Sehwag more options in the pace bowling department.West Indies: West Indies' recent ODI outing was against Bangladesh where they won the series 2-1 before travelling to India. While they will be looking to take confidence from that series win, the Caribbean team will also be wary of what happened in the final ODI when they were skittled out for just 61 runs. The West Indian batters, who had struggled against the Bangladeshi spinners, will have their tasks cut out as the Indians will come at them with a spin-heavy attack. Having said that, the tourists do have a decent batting line-up capable of countering the Indian attack. In Lendl Simmons and Adrian Barath, West Indies have two good openers who are capable of providing the team a solid start. West Indies will also bank on the in-form batsman Darren Bravo, who scored two fine hundreds in the Test series.Kieron Pollard adds strength to the West Indian middle order as do Marlon Samuels, Andre Russell and Darren Sammy. Denesh Ramdin, who was mostly a spectator during the Test series, will get an opportunity to showcase his skills with the bat and the gloves. In the spin department, West Indies have the talented Sunil Narine along with Jason Mohammad and Anthony Martin while Ravi Rampaul and Kemar Roach will be manning the pace division.Watch out for:He has dominated various bowling attacks in the Test arena, but Virender Sehwag has not been able to produce the same kind of impact in the ODIs. He now has an ideal opportunity to prove his match-turning ability with the bat in the five-match series against West Indies. The added responsibility of captaincy also means that the swashbuckling opener would be quite keen to lead from the front.West Indies will be boosted by the presence of a quality all-rounder like Kieron Pollard who will be looking to stamp his authority over the Indians. Pollard will be hoping to improve his record as he has only shown flashes of brilliance in the 50-over format, but is yet to make a mark for himself. Pollard though, is a vital cog in the West Indian middle order and his contribution would be crucial for the team.Captain Quotes: "We bounced back during the ODI series against England and we also won the recent Test series against the West Indies. The team is on a roll at the moment"- Virender Sehwag is full of confidence ahead of the series opener at Cuttack. There is no doubt that India will miss Dhoni. Looking at the one-day series against England (both away and in India), Dhoni contributed a lot lower down the order. Basically, he finishes the game for India all the time" - West Indies skipper Darren Sammy emphasizes that India will miss Dhoni's finishing abilities.Teams:India (From): Virender Sehwag(c), Parthiv Patel(w), Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Vinay Kumar, Varun Aaron, Umesh Yadav, Rahul Sharma, Praveen Kumar, Ajinkya Rahane, Manoj TiwaryWest Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Lendl Simmons, Adrian Barath, Darren Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Danza Hyatt, Kieran Powell, Anthony Martin, Jason MohammedLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
