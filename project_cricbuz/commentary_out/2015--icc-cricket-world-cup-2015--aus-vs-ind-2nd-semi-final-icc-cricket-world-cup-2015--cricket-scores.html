That was not deliberate and an easy call for the umpireA man under the helmet for Raina as well
INDIA:20.4 Starc to Raina, no run, fuller and tails back in, Raina is half-forward and defending back down the wicket. It was bowled at 151kph

INDIA:20.2 Starc to Rahane, no run, half an appeal for caught behind, but it was aborted midway. Short delivery, Rahane takes it on, goes for hook, does not make contact. The Snicko also does not pick up anythingClarke still persisting with the FSL fielder
INDIA:20.1 Starc to Rahane, no run, back of a length on off, Rahane hops across and taps it to backward pointIt was the impressive, Josh Hazlewood, who eventually took the wicket of Dhawan to lift the fielding side. It was a well-timed shot, but Dhawan smashed it straight to Glenn Maxwell at sweeper cover and took a long walk back to the pavilion with a dejected look on his face. Hazlewood troubled Virat Kohli as well by bowling in the corridor of uncertainty and extracting bounce. Mitchell Johnson followed up Hazlewood's effort by snaffling the wicket of Kohli, with Brad Haddin taking the catch. Johnson banged it short, and bowled it across the right-hander and Kohli couldn't control the pull shot. It is risky to take on the slingy left-armer's angle of Johnson and that was a quick delivery too. To make it even better for Australia, Johnson shattered Rohit's stumps. It was a cross-seam delivery from the left-arm pacer that moved off the track. Johnson unquestionably is a cricketer made for the big occasion.With it being a belter of a track, Shikhar Dhawan used his feet to James Faulkner and played a volley of thunderous strokes. Michael Clarke perhaps missed a trick by not asking the wicket-keeper, Brad Haddin, to come up to the stumps for the medium pacer.

INDIA:10.1 Johnson to Rohit, 1 run, fuller length delivery and well outside off, Rohit presses forward and drives it past cover for a singleJosh Hazlewood was impressive. Hazlewood hits the splice of the bat and it is never easy to smash him through the line. It was Shikhar Dhawan, who took on Hazlewood by essaying an imperious pull. Hazlewood made a strong comeback to get the ball to zip off the wicket to produce the edge, but Haddin dropped the catch and Dhawan got a reprieve. Dhawan then clouted James Faulkner for 14 runs. The Indian camp will be pleased with the fact that they have come through testing spells without losing a wicket. Mitchell Starc swung the new ball a bit and with the left-armer's angle coming into play as well, he troubled Rohit Sharma. Rohit's tendency to open the face of the bat didn't help his cause. Starc also produced the edge off Rohit's bat and Shane Watson took the ball in the slip cordon. The benefit of doubt though, went in the batsman's favour.

Rohit is on strike. Starc will open the attackAny positives. Well, there's one. India haven't lost at the SCG on the tour so far. Can they stop Australia's dominance?Welcome back.. India arrived in Australia in the last week of November, played 4 Tests and a couple of matches in the tri-series against Australia. They didn't win a single match, lost 3, drew 2 and one ended in a no-result. Now, in the biggest match of their tour so far, they need to chase 329 to enter the 2015 World Cup final. History is against them, no team barring Australia have chased 300+ at the SCG. Can India rewrite history? We will get to know over the next 50 overs.Smith: "It was a handy little cameo there in the end (from Mitchell Johnson). To get 27 off 9 balls and to get us to 328, I think it's a good total, but we have got to bowl and field well though. I think if you get off to 328 at the start of the day you take that 9 out of 10 times. For us it's going to be about squeezing and building the pressure. Hopefully our bowlers and fielders can really do the job for us. It (the pitch) was a little tacky early on at the start. A couple sort of popped but it got better after the first 8 or 10 overs. It's a pretty good wicket. It's always nice getting hundreds at the SCG, it's my favourite place to play. It's a World Cup semi-final, it's a pretty big stage. Hopefully the boys can back it up in the field now and we can join New Zealand in the final."Michael Clarke struggled to find gaps in the field and soon he lost his wicket to a short ball. With Finch and Clarke getting out in quick succession, India pulled the batting side back to some extent. It was James Faulkner, Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson, who with some lethal strikes lifted Australia's sagging morale. For India, Umesh picked up four wickets. In fact, Umesh used the short ball smartly. With the odd ball stopping on the batsman, sometimes it can be difficult to play the pull shot. Ashwin bowled with unremitting control. The deck is still good for batting and the outfield is lightning quick. It comes down to whether India can handle the pressure of playing in a semi-final. On the other hand, Australia will look to mix it up by using cross-seam and slower deliveries to get it to grip off the surface.When MS Dhoni introduced the spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin into the attack, Smith refused to buckle down. He used the crease to milk them for singles and twos. With Smith nearing his century, he hoicked Shami across the line for a six. He then reached his hundred in style by clouting Shami for another boundary. Once Smith was dismissed, Glenn Maxwell for a brief period, bedazzled the crowd with a cameo. With Maxwell in a belligerent mood, Dhoni took a brave call of bringing Ashwin back into the attack and he repaid the faith by producing the wicket of Maxwell. It has to be remembered that in the past, Maxwell has usually smacked Ashwin all over the park.Earlier, India started on a good note with both Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav bowling with a decent burst of pace and generating swing to keep the batsmen on their toes. Umesh was rewarded with the important wicket of David Warner. It was Smith, who took them out of troubled waters by unfurling a series of boundaries. He cracked Umesh for four fours in the 10th over. In the backdrop of a sizzling atmosphere, Steven Smith's marvellous exhibition of stroke-play helped Australia to notch up a massive score. Smith reigned supreme as he showcased majestic wrist-work to put the bowlers under pressure. There were occasions when the bowlers were left to scratch their heads in disbelief as Smith bisected gaps in the field on both sides of the wicket with customary ease. Aaron Finch, who struggled for timing and placement early on in his innings also played a major role by compiling a gutsy knock. It was strange to see Dhoni not give the ball to Umesh, who has picked four wickets. He had one over up his sleeve, but Dhoni opted for Mohit. Yes, both bowlers were expensive, but Umesh was more successful.4

Full and outside off stump, again Haddin doesn't get hold of the drive, it goes to mid-off, Kohli has a shy at the striker's end as Johnson was late to take off and a direct-hit would have been curtains for Johnson. 300 up for Australia

AUSTRALIA:46.3 U Yadav to Faulkner, out Bowled!! Knocked him over. Oh he's bowled him with a length ball. Faulkner would have normally sent that out of the park, but maybe the ball swung back in very late and foxed the batsman. Faulkner was aiming mid-wicket, but missed and the ball rattled into middle and leg. Fourth wicket for Umesh Yadav. Faulkner b U Yadav 21(12) [4s-3 6s-1]U Yadav to Faulkner, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
AUSTRALIA:46.2 U Yadav to Faulkner, FOUR, no Umesh, poor ball. Can't bowl full and in the slot to this man at this stage. Faulkner cleared his front leg out of the way and slogged it over wide mid-on. In fact, Umesh is lucky that it didn't go all the way

AUSTRALIA:45.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Watson, 1 run, width on offer outside off stump, slapped over cover, but there is a man sweeping on the off-side and it's only a run. Good comeback from Jadeja, after being hit for a six very early in his over

Short ball from Mohit, was there to be hit, Clarke goes on the back foot to pull, but doesn't get the timing right. Rohit hardly had to move an inch and he throws the ball up in the air in joy after completing the catch. In fact, he just jumped a bit before taking the catch. Clarke c Rohit b Mohit Sharma 10(12) [4s-1]Mohit Sharma to Clarke, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Mohit Sharma [7.0-0-47-0] is back into the attackThis match was heading in a similar fashion to the 2003 World Cup final - Ponting scored a hundred coming in at No. 3, Smith scored a hundred at the same position - but MS Dhoni and his boys have managed to change the script a bit with those two quick wickets.

AUSTRALIA:40.1 Shami to Watson, 1 run, good length delivery outside off stump, Watson drives with an angled bat, Jadeja makes an excellent diving save to his right at backward pointMohammed Shami [7.0-0-40-0] is back into the attackSmith then hoicked Shami across the line for a crunching six. He also reached a well-deserved century in just 89 balls. It was a memorable hundred from him. Smith continued to deal in boundaries by picking a slower delivery from Mohit Sharma to land a meaty blow down the ground. With Smith checking in a series of boundaries, Finch too made his presence felt by playing a cheeky paddle sweep. It was Umesh Yadav, who eventually dismissed the well-set Smith. The power-hitter Glenn Maxwell, who replaced Smith at the crease yet again looked to take his game to an elevated plane. Ashwin though, provided the vital breakthrough by sending Maxwell back to the pavilion. Umesh followed it up by dismissing Finch to give India a glimmer of hope of restricting the opposition. Curiously, in the past, Ashwin has struggled while bowling up to Maxwell, but today was his day. India to some extent did a reasonable job by bowling a few tight overs during the middle part of the innings. It was Aaron Finch, who on occasions, struggled to find gaps in the field and the bowlers were able to join the dots. However, Steven Smith kept the scorecard ticking with marvellous wrist-work. Smith showcased his ability to play with supple wrists, by walking across the stumps to collect a boundary off Mohammed Shami.

The ball hits him high on the bat and balloons up in the air, short mid-wicket moves to his left and jumps and grabs it with both hands. Dhawan timed his jump to perfection. Australia wanted a set batsman to carry on, but Finch has thrown it away. Anyway, a fine knock from him. He struggled at the start, but did well to fight it out. By the way, that is wicket number three for Umesh. Finch c Dhawan b U Yadav 81(116) [4s-7 6s-1]U Yadav to Finch, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

AUSTRALIA:37.3 Ashwin to Maxwell, out Caught by Rahane!! Oh he's hit that straight to the fielder. Minus some 20-30 runs from the final total Australia. Actually, not a wicket taking ball, but Ashwin and India will take it. Flatter ball on the leg stump, Maxwell slog-sweeps, doesn't bother to keep it down and picks out Jinks to perfection at deep backward square leg. No celebrations from Ashwin, just walks to Rohit Sharma and joins the huddle. Maxwell c Rahane b Ashwin 23(14) [4s-3 6s-1]Ashwin to Maxwell, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:37.2 Ashwin to Maxwell, no run, that's a fine ball from Ashwin. Maxwell was looking for the big hit, but Ashwin kept him calm by tossing it up nicely, Maxwell defends and smilesAh! Maxwell v Ashwin, just what Shane Warne wanted.

A direct-hit would have been curtains for Finch

AUSTRALIA:34.4 U Yadav to Maxwell, wide, oh no Umesh Yadav! He bowls down the leg-side again. Dhoni isn't happy
AUSTRALIA:34.3 U Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR, that's a gift first ball. Fourth time that Umesh has strayed onto the pads in this over. Nothing ball! Length and down the leg-side, Maxwell flicks it behind square on the on-side and Ashwin is not going to stop those running to his left from fine leg

Some respite for the Indians as they get a breather to regroup. But what respite when you have the Big Show walking in. Bring on Ashwin from the other end I say, he would say as well. Get ready for the most exciting phase of play one way or the other.
AUSTRALIA:34.1 U Yadav to S Smith, out Caught by Rohit!! Umesh strikes and a much needed wicket for India. Dug in short on the stumps, Smith made room for the big pull, but spliced it, Rohit at deep mid-wicket settled under the skier and took it easily. Smith walks off waving his bat to all corners of the ground. This has been a special innings, will be even more special at the end of the match if his side emerge victorious.

AUSTRALIA:33.2 Mohit Sharma to Finch, 1 run, low full toss, flicked to mid-wicket, for a single
AUSTRALIA:33.1 Mohit Sharma to Finch, SIX, that is an amazing shot. It was short and bouncing, Finch had made room and was on the hop, but he reached out and slapped a cut over sweeper cover. That is tremendous bat-speed generated and brilliant timing. The ball has all the legs to go all the wayMohit Sharma [6.0-0-31-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:32.6 Shami to S Smith, FOUR, 100 for Smith! The Indians will be waking up with cold sweat in the middle of the night at the sight of Smith walking out to bat. He has done it all summer to them. Mountain of runs in the Tests. And now in a World Cup semi, he has churned out a 100. What.A.Playaaaa! Magnificent. Gets a shortish ball outside off and pulls behind square, no-one there and it races away. At No. 3 he has got a hundred. Controlled the innings and made it count on the big day. Celebrates by removing the helmet and soaks in all the applause
AUSTRALIA:32.5 Shami to S Smith, SIX, first ugly shot that Smith has attempted today - if I may call it that - on a good length and outside off, Smith cleared his front leg and smoked it over wide long-on. The third umpire has a look and the ball has crossed the ad-cushions on the full. Agricultural but effective
AUSTRALIA:32.4 Shami to S Smith, no run, full and outside off, Smith went for a big cover drive. The feet didn't move and the ball beats Smith on the outside edge
AUSTRALIA:32.3 Shami to S Smith, FOUR, low full toss on the stumps, Smith gets inside the line and clips it past the fielder inside the ring at short fine, needed to hit the gap and did so with ease

AUSTRALIA:32.1 Shami to S Smith, no run, back of a length outside off, Smith opens the face of the bat and punches hard, but finds Jadeja at point who makes a smart stop.

AUSTRALIA:31.6 Ashwin to Finch, no run, makes room, rocks back and cuts hard, but finds Jadeja at cover. Once again Finch is a disappointed man. He wants to smash those short ones through the off-side cordon, but is failing to find the gap
AUSTRALIA:31.5 Ashwin to Finch, no run, pushed through quicker, Finch pre-meditates the reverse sweep and misses. Is struck outside the line of off, so India's appeal for lbw is turned down
AUSTRALIA:31.4 Ashwin to Finch, 2 runs, that's sloppy from Rohit at cover-point. Finch was a disappointed man as he went hard on the cut, didn't get it in the gap, it went straight to the fielder and Rohit fumbled, gives away two. That won't please MS and Ashwin
AUSTRALIA:31.3 Ashwin to Finch, 2 runs, tossed up outside off, Finch went for the reverse sweep and mistimed it, got it wide of backward point though, gets a couple
AUSTRALIA:31.2 Ashwin to S Smith, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Smith uses his feet and drives to long-on

AUSTRALIA:30.4 Mohit Sharma to Finch, no run, loud shout for lbw, Kettleborough has a look at it and then says no. The Indians don't have a review. The ball nips back in and strikes Finch above the knee roll. Finch was on the shuffle and missed the clip. Impact - umpire's call and just about clipping. So the original decision would've stood even if India had a review. Mohit was absolutely convinced and wore a puzzled look on his face when the decision went against himNow Mahendra Singh Dhoni goes back to Finch
AUSTRALIA:30.3 Mohit Sharma to S Smith, 1 run, the slower delivery outside off, comes on ever so slowly, punched to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:30.2 Mohit Sharma to S Smith, no run, short of length on the stumps, pushed to short cover
AUSTRALIA:30.1 Mohit Sharma to S Smith, FOUR, magnificent shot. It was a back of a length on off, Smith unfurled a solid back foot punch that beat mid-on diving to his left. Mohit Sharma closes his eyes as the ball beats the fielder and wears a resigned look on his faceDhoni is standing up to Mohit nowIn fact, as Smith picks the spinner from the hand, he is able to play from deep in the crease. Smith's partner at the other end, Finch used the sweep shot to keep the spin duo guessing. Smith and Finch also took quick singles to frustrate the opposition. India desperately need a couple of wickets as it is never easy to chase down a mammoth target in a pressure game.Aaron Finch punished Ravichandran Ashwin for bowling short by rocking back to cut him for a boundary in the 22nd over. With confident strides, Steven Smith and Finch have looked to play right back or come well forward while facing up to the spinners. In particular, Smith comes across as a natural player of spin as he picks a spinner generally from the hand. 
AUSTRALIA:29.6 Ashwin to Finch, no run, well tossed up outside off, Finch is on the move as he defends to short mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:29.5 Ashwin to Finch, no run, shorter and that allows Finch to go back and glance to short fine

AUSTRALIA:29.1 Ashwin to Finch, no run, Finch gets forward and flicks to the left of short mid-wicket, good stop and a back-handed flick back to AshwinThis is a nice platform being set by these two. Australia are well placed for the final assault in the last 15 overs or so. With the likes of Maxwell and Faulkner to come, they will aim for 330 plus. In a semi-final if Australia get that kind of a total, the pressure of chasing will multiply on the Indians. Smith is already looking to take risks and is opening out
AUSTRALIA:28.6 Mohit Sharma to S Smith, 2 runs, short and outside off, Smith pulls to deep backward square leg, Umesh runs around and puts in an awkward dive, but manages to get hold of the ball. Only two

AUSTRALIA:24.4 Ravindra Jadeja to S Smith, SIX, that is an exceptional stroke. It wasn't short. It was on a back of a length, but Smith went back in a flash and pulled it over deep mid-wicket. Flat hit and went all the way. Terrific batting from Smith

AUSTRALIA:24.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, no run, was there an inside edge onto the pads? No. Straight off the pad and caught by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Appeal from India, but simple decision from KettleboroughFinch removes his helmet and wipes away his face as he stops Ravindra Jadeja

AUSTRALIA:22.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, no run, Finch got outside off and went for the big sweep, it was too full and he missed, but he got outside the line. Impact was umpire's call and Finch will stay. Just got outside the line, but that will do. It was Ravindra Jadeja who forced Mahendra Singh Dhoni who also felt that it had struck the batsman outside the line of off. Ravindra Jadeja though was very convinced and eventually MS had no option but to go for the reviewRavindra Jadeja is adamant that he has got Finch out lbw. He has forced Mahendra Singh Dhoni to review. That looked like outside the line of off to me. Replays will tell. 'That's a fair delivery, spin vision, front-on please' says Marais Erasmus. 'Just rock and roll that, can you get me RTS please? Rock and roll that. Nothing on the bat, when ball-tracking is ready, please. Impact - umpire's call! So Richard you can stay with your decision, I will tell you when you are on screen, thank you!' So Finch gets away. India lose their only review

AUSTRALIA:20.1 Ravindra Jadeja to S Smith, 1 run, advances and drives the flighted delivery to long-onFor Australia, Smith used the depth of the crease to handle Ravindra Jadeja with aplomb. On the other hand, Aaron Finch played a power-packed shot through the cover region to clobber Jadeja for a boundary in the 16th over. Finch and Smith have set a solid platform for Australia to amass a massive total. India certainly need Ravichandran Ashwin to weave his magic.Interestingly, Virat Kohli was introduced into the attack in the 12th over. Steven Smith took full advantage of a part-timer coming into the attack by thumping him for a four. Mohit Sharma occasionally tried the short ball, but he didn't get it head high or outside the off-stump to trouble the batsmen. On this track, on expected lines, Mohit also mixed it up by bowling off-cutters and slower deliveries to get it to grip off the surface.
AUSTRALIA:19.6 Ashwin to Finch, no run, tossed up on the off stump, defended

AUSTRALIA:14.1 Mohit Sharma to S Smith, 1 run, short of length and angling in, punched wide of mid-on for a singleIndia sense a chance to get the Aussies out on the short ball. The problem is that the bowlers aren't left-arm quick like Riaz and so don't have the left-armer's angle to work with. If you don't get it right on this pitch, the short ball just sits up to be whacked. Finch and Smith are very good pullers/hookers and they are just smashing those short balls. Sometimes wonder what goes on in MS' mind, Kohli hasn't bowled in 17 ODIs and he brings him on in a World Cup semi. But that experiment lasted just one over. MS, oh MS!
AUSTRALIA:13.6 Ravindra Jadeja to S Smith, 3 runs, well played. Against the turn. Smith using his feet and whipping that past mid-wicket. Dhawan gives chase, but can't prevent the three

AUSTRALIA:10.1 Mohit Sharma to Finch, 1 run, good length on middle, tucked to deep mid-wicketMohit Sharma, right-arm medium, comes into the attackIt was David Warner, who started on a good note by presenting a full face of the bat and collect four runs off Umesh Yadav. He also thumped Umesh for a six over deep square-leg. However, Umesh came back strongly to induce a leading edge from Warner to snare his wicket. With it being a dry track, Umesh used the off-cutter to dismiss Warner. Steven Smith, who replaced Warner at the crease, then essayed a flurry of boundaries. The outfield is lightning quick and the spinners may get a bit of purchase later on in the match.Thousands of frenzied fans flocked to watch a high voltage contest at the SCG. The historic stadium, mainly made up of flag-waving Indians, certainly created an electric atmosphere. It was Mohammed Shami, who opened the bowling for India. Shami bowled with unrelenting control and generated swing to trouble Aaron Finch. Finch hangs back in the crease and is vulnerable against the new ball
AUSTRALIA:9.6 U Yadav to S Smith, no run, short of length and nipping back in, defended to short mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:9.5 U Yadav to S Smith, FOUR, a carbon copy of the previous shot. Similar delivery, around the same height, similar shot and similar result. Yadav needs to dig it in much shorter and get it rise near the chest/face area of Smith. Or else Smith will cash in all day. That's 16 off the over - all in boundaries
AUSTRALIA:9.4 U Yadav to S Smith, FOUR, the new one works well alright. Cracking pull from Smith. It was short and on the stumps, Smith swivel-pulled to the right of square leg. The ball didn't rise and that made Smith's job easier. Third boundary of the overLooks like Smith needs a change of bat. Slight delay. The substitute runs out with a few bats and Smith chooses one. How will the new one go?

AUSTRALIA:9.1 U Yadav to S Smith, FOUR, was in the air, but wide of the man at point. Jadeja running from point could've done some serious damage to himself as he dived head-first into the ad-boards. Ashwin from third man didn't get there and wore a shocked expression on seeing Jadeja go in so hard at full pelt. Luckily no damage done to Jadeja as he gets up quickly. Smith cutting hard in the air and getting lucky
AUSTRALIA:8.6 Shami to Finch, no run, back of a length and Shami forces Finch to defend, the batsman doing just that to mid-on

AUSTRALIA:5.5 U Yadav to Finch, no run, brilliant delivery. Outswinging yorker from Yadav, but the line wasn't on the stumps. It was just outside off and Finch couldn't squeeze it out. Late shape away on the ball
AUSTRALIA:5.4 U Yadav to Finch, no run, short of length on off, Finch hops a little and defends back down the wicket
AUSTRALIA:5.3 U Yadav to S Smith, 1 run, on a good length and on off, Smith looks to defend and plays with soft hands down to third man
AUSTRALIA:5.2 U Yadav to S Smith, no run, on a good length and outside off, swinging away, left alone
AUSTRALIA:5.1 U Yadav to S Smith, no run, India ponder a review. Against Smith. For lbw. Dhoni has a word with Yadav and they go back to their positions. It nipped back in and Smith on the shuffle missed the flick, it clipped the thigh pad and replays show that it just was clipping - umpire's call it was and the original decision would've stood. Smith in trouble there, but got awayNo leg slip now for Umesh against Smith
AUSTRALIA:4.6 Shami to S Smith, 3 runs, Shami went for the yorker, but it turned out to be a low full toss, on middle, clipped through mid-wicket. Rohit gives chase and pulls it back. Saved a run thereLeg slip for Smith again

AUSTRALIA:4.1 Shami to Finch, FOUR, very full from Shami and Finch just relied on timing that time. Got forward and showed the full face of the bat, gets it past the stumps at the other end and the ball races away

AUSTRALIA:3.5 U Yadav to S Smith, no run, Yadav pulls the length back and bowls it on a back of a length on the hips, tucked to short mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:3.4 U Yadav to S Smith, FOUR, that's a magnificent shot. The feet didn't move that well, but look at the timing on that. The full face of the bat shown and he has timed the drive past a very short mid-off, beating the fielder to his right. Fantastic off-drive from SmithWould be a good idea to bowl full and try to york Smith early for he shuffles a lot and exposes his middle and leg stump. Wouldn't be a bad idea to fire in the yorker
AUSTRALIA:3.3 U Yadav to S Smith, no run, back of a length on the hips, turned to square legTwo slips and a gully for Smith
AUSTRALIA:3.2 U Yadav to S Smith, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, swing away for Yadav, Smith opens the face of the bat and pushes it wide of point, knows Ashwin is there at third man, takes him on and makes it back easilySteven Smith, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:3.1 U Yadav to Warner, out Caught by Kohli!! Big, big moment. Warner is gone. Warner too early into the flick and the leading edge goes straight up in the air. A dolly to mid-off and Yadav roars away in delight. Not as ferociously as Steyn against Sri Lanka, but a good attempt nevertheless. India's army at the SCG go wild too. Warner c Kohli b U Yadav 12(7) [4s-1 6s-1]U Yadav to Warner, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Shami certainly tested Finch in that over but didn't have the desired result that he was seeking to go for him
AUSTRALIA:2.6 Shami to Finch, no run, back of a length outside off, Finch shoulders arms

AUSTRALIA:2.3 Shami to Finch, no run, short of length and outside off, Finch defends to square leg
AUSTRALIA:2.2 Shami to Finch, no run, Shami belts out a loud lbw appeal against Finch, but that was a bit too high. Finch caught on the shuffle, this one nips back in and catches him on the pad, above the kneeroll. Kettleborough is the best umpire in the world and has a look, before saying no. India don't review and rightly so, that would've gone over
AUSTRALIA:2.1 Shami to Finch, no run, very ambitious and extravagant from Finch. Went for a big lofted drive over mid-off, but the ball was pitched on a good length and had an upright seam, it nipped off the seam and went past the inside edge, not close to hitting off though
AUSTRALIA:2.1 Shami to Finch, wide, swing for Shami, but down leg, it swings further and Dhoni collects. Called wide
AUSTRALIA:1.6 U Yadav to Warner, SIX, Warner wants to make a statement early on and he does so here. It was slightly short and outside off, Warner lifted one leg up in the air and pulled it hard over deep square leg, just about carried over the ad-cushions. The extra pace of Yadav proving to be productive for Warner
AUSTRALIA:1.5 U Yadav to Finch, 1 run, 147.6 kph and would've been a dolly to gully which is vacant. Yadav squaring up Finch with a delivery that straightened a tad and caught the outside edge, it flew through the vacant space and down to third man. Just the two slips and no-one at gully
AUSTRALIA:1.4 U Yadav to Finch, no run, back of a length outside off, Finch hops and defendsTwo slips for Yadav too
AUSTRALIA:1.3 U Yadav to Warner, 1 run, on a good length and outside off, Warner gets forward and pushes it wide of cover, easy single
AUSTRALIA:1.2 U Yadav to Warner, no run, short of length on off, Warner shuffles across a tad and defends to the right of the bowler
AUSTRALIA:1.1 U Yadav to Warner, FOUR, lovely shot. Just a forward punch from Warner and it beat mid-off to his left. Got forward and offered the full face of the bat, the rich timing did the rest. Yadav a tad guilty of overpitching and being made to pay for itUmesh Yadav, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
AUSTRALIA:0.6 Shami to Finch, no run, short of length and a hint of nip back in, Finch blocks from the crease to short mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:0.5 Shami to Warner, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Warner gets forward and pushes it wide of mid-off, quick single to get off the mark
AUSTRALIA:0.4 Shami to Warner, no run, Shami beats Warner. Lovely outswinger, but angled across on a fuller length, Warner went for an ambitious on-the-up drive and was beaten. Just about carried to Dhoni. Nice start from Shami
AUSTRALIA:0.3 Shami to Finch, leg byes, 1 run, loud appeal for lbw, but that was sliding down leg, full and on the pads, Finch shuffled across to flick and missed. But the ball would've gone down. They take a leg bye and the umpire doesn't signal runs
AUSTRALIA:0.2 Shami to Finch, no run, short of length outside off, punched softly to coverTwo slips in place
AUSTRALIA:0.1 Shami to Finch, no run, straightaway Shami beats Finch. A gentle outswinger from Shami, Finch is tentative first up and his nervous push meets thin air. Expectedly, the feet don't move and he gets away. Shami has a wry smile on his faceFinch and Warner are at the crease. Finch is on strike. Shami will open the attackThe players are striding out to the middle. Warner is walking with a spring in his step. He is up for it. Shami has the new ball. The countdown starts. 'We are ready to play' says Mark Nicholas on air. Here we go then...Time for the national anthems. A lovely moment there as soon as the Indian national anthem starts. The young kids remove their caps without any prompting from the Indians. One kid doesn't and is asked to do so by the one next to him. Superb. Lots of Indian flags in the crowd. Rousing rendition of the anthems are done. Raw passion on display.Pitch Report by Shane Warne: This was the one used between Australia and Sri Lanka. It is a belter of a pitch. It doesn't spin as much as you think. It is rock hard. It should be a ripping match. I am looking forward to Maxwell vs AshwinTeams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit SharmaAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh HazlewoodAustralia have won the toss and have opted to batDhoni: "I think the way we have transformed from the tri-series, getting into the World Cup was very important for us. All of us are looking good. That's something that is very important. Everybody has got a chance to bat, bowl, fielding has been good, overall preparation looks good. Not really. I feel it wouldn't really change much. The toss is something beyond the control, you have to accept it. But, yes we would have also batted first as well. Everyone is fit. So, that give us a liberty of playing with the same squad. I think each and every one in a game like this you have to be at your best irrespective of whether you are opening the innings or batting in the middle order. So, get off to a good start, if you get a good start make sure you score big, that is something we always emphasize on. The partnership is more important than individual performance. So, that has been the key for us throughout this World Cup."Clarke: "Not too much (on what has he said to his mates before the game). It's about enjoying. It's a big occasion, it's a special day. We know we are up against a fantastic team, but we love playing here at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The boys are ready to go, they have trained really well. That's all I can ask for. We are going to have a bat Flem (Damien Fleming), thank you. I think we are about to find out. The wicket looks great. I think it will be pretty good for both innings, runs on the board is the reason why we have gone for batting first. Same XI for us today. I thought he (Hazlewood) was exceptional. I think he grabbed his opportunity with both hands, the selectors believe this is the right XI for these conditions. I am confident if we play our best cricket, we can have success today."Our man G Rajaraman is at the ground and reckons that Australia might not play Xavier Doherty. He's not amongst the group of bowlers warming-up for Australia. Hazlewood will keep his place as well, ahead of Pat Cummins."He (Dhoni) is unbelievable. There's no comparison. He just sits alone when it comes to ODI cricket. Character, a steely character, there is a desire to win, the desire to play as a unit (asked what impressed him the most in this team). The desire to play for each other, which has been absolutely brilliant to see. That's what you need in any team (the mix of youth and age). You need that because, if you see the way they have fielded, it's because of that. There's youth there, there are some young legs there and of course you need experience on an occasion like this. Fabulous (to be here today). I feel like putting on my blues and getting out there. 30 years to the day, which the boys know, India beat NZ in the world championship of cricket in the semi-final and I was the Man of the Match, so I said if you get me one Man of the Match today, history might just repeat itself. Pleasure, go India!""You can (overplay a big occasion). If you think too much or too far ahead, you could make mistakes. Our mantra has been don't think too far ahead. Forget the past and live in the present and be calm in the present. Massive (when asked if Dhoni's presence is an advantage). If there is a bigger word than massive, use that word. Your vocabulary is better than mine, so go right ahead and use that word, because that's how big a player he is. It's not about individuals, it's about a collective team effort and that's what team India has brought to the table in this World Cup. It's not about individual performances, but every time when someone is needed, he's put up his hand, each one of those 11 players.""I've not seen the pitch but I think MS (Dhoni) has his plans. If you win the toss, obviously you would want to bat first. Why should you change it (the team) when nothing has happened? They've done brilliantly, each one of them in the 11 and they'll go out and enjoy the occasion today. I think the calmness will be the key today. you got to be calm there, soak in the pressure and then enjoy. Just think that you've got a stage there, you've been watched by 60000 people, so go out there and give it your best shot, enjoy it. They (the players) are very calm, very composed and looking forward to this game and it's a great occasion, a world cup semifinal and on the back of being the holders, the way they have played, I think everyone in India should be proud and all the Indian fans watching around the world, you should be proud of this cricket team the way they have played."Shastri: "Absolutely fine (when asked how are the soldiers). They are ready and up for it like never before, let me assure you that. They want to go out there and play fearless, aggressive cricket and enjoy the occasion. They don't need any motivation, they've played fabulous cricket in this World Cup. They know each one of them can hold their heads high with the way they have played and as a unit they have looked fabulous. Today is game 8 and they have to approach it just in that fashion that they've approached the other ones. Doesn't matter (when told that game 8 is against Australia). Not at all (when reminded that there have to be scars from what's gone before). That's all baggage. This is the big one, those mickey mouse tournaments are over. This is where you want to win. Absolutely not (when asked if Australia have the wood over India). We are the defending champions, we are the favourites, pressure on Australia."A while ago, Mark Nicholas spoke to Ravi Shastri and here is the interview transcribed word-to-word. Expectedly, Shastri was gung-ho about India's chances. Lots of bravado and some stirring statements. The interview though is a gem. Imagine Ravi inside the dressing room, talking to the players. Some motivator he is!Rohit Sharma on how batting up the order has helped him - "Over the years I've learnt a lot of things. Certainly batting up the order has changed my game, my approach towards the game and the responsibility."Quotes: Michael Clarke is precise with his assessment - "We have to execute our skills as well as we possibly can and if we do that, I have confidence that we can beat any team."Weather update: The forecast for this game is fine. The weather conditions were a bit overcast and rainy over the last couple of days but on match day there is no rain predicted.India: Absolutely no changes unless someone gets injured or wakes up ill.Pre-match team news, Australia: Australia are most likely to go in unchanged from their quarter-final game.Head-to-head record: India and Australia have clashed 10 times in World Cups with Australia winning 7 of them. But India won their last encounter - a World Cup quarter-final at Motera in Ahmedabad. That was a gripping game which India won thanks to Yuvraj and Raina's calmness under pressure in a chase. If you look at the overall record, in the last five meetings between the sides, India has won two, Australia one with two games washed out. Australia though have a 12-1 record against India at the SCG and also are yet to lose a World Cup semi-final, winning 6 of them."Maxwell is the leading run-scorer for Australia in this edition with 301 runs at an average of 75. His audacious batting will be a major concern for India but Ashwin, with 12 wickets, is also in good form. India will be aware of the damage Maxwell can cause in Sydney, where he smashed a 51-ball hundred against Sri Lanka. Ashwin's aim will be simple. Get rid of the Big Show and become the showstopper.""The stats concur with Maxwell's assessment. In seven ODIs that Ashwin has played against Maxwell, he has dismissed him in only one match and that was two years ago in Nagpur but it was after the batsman had smashed two consecutive fours off him of the previous two balls.""The rivalry between Glenn Maxwell and R Ashwin has been simmering for quite some time. The Australian dasher has always held the advantage over India's premier spinner. In the T20Is and in the IPL, Maxwell has torn Ashwin apart on several occasions and after his 38-ball 90 for Kings XI Punjab against Chennai Super Kings in IPL 7, Maxwell said that he enjoyed facing Ashwin as he was easy to pick."Glenn Maxwell v R Ashwin"Rohit, though, will know the damage Mitchell Johnson can cause on day. During the second Test in Brisbane, Rohit engaged in a sledging duel with Johnson and it proved to be costly for India. Johnson smashed an aggressive 88 and picked up 4 wickets, including Rohit in the second innings to give Australia victory. Johnson has underperformed in this World Cup so far but he will be desperate to put in a hostile show on the big stage. Johnson must realise that he needs to be the leader of the attack, not the leader of a sledging unit.""Rohit Sharma likes batting against Australia. He has an average of 58.71 in ODIs against them and in the tri-series, Rohit started off with a bang by scoring 138 in Melbourne. In the World Cup, he has performed well against the lesser teams but against the big teams, he has struggled a bit. However, heading into the semi-final, Rohit will be high on confidence following his century against Bangladesh in the quarter-finals."Some key battles to look forward to in the semi-final. Here is our editors' pick of the lot. Mitchell Johnson v Rohit Sharma"We went to work immediately, wrote things down on what we need to improve on are. The way the bowlers have reacted and performed with composure, confidence and aggression has been wonderful to watch. You expect bowlers to step up if you want to beat quality sides in the world and the way they have done this in the World Cup is commendable," Kohli said.Virat Kohli has revealed that the team went to work after the Test series and the tri-series, writing down things that needed improvement. Talking to Cricket Australia, Kohli said, "We felt as a group that we need to step up and make corrections now. We don't really have too much time because you can't afford to go into the World Cup thinking 'Okay, fine, we have things to work on but we can do it over a period of time'," he said, about the team's '180 degree turnaround'."Yes, it all depends on the wicket and how it is," Rohit spoke of the SCG pitch. "Of course, if you look at the history of the city, it gives a lot of time towards spin bowlers, and they actually come out and bowl really well. [If] you see the Test matches we played in Australia, the spinners played a huge part. So I think if it does [on Thursday], we've got the spinners to do it.Rohit, speaking to the media, reckoned that spin will definitely play a role come match day.Meanwhile former Aussie pacer Brett Lee reckoned Australia will win. "It is going to be a lot of fun. Full crowds and packed stadium. I honestly think Australia will win on Thursday night. But you also got to think about the chance of India. They have played extremely well, won seven from seven. Australia have won five from seven, that's including one wash out. We have to wait and see," Lee said."I really do think it's a 50-50 call. In all semifinals, the team that plays well in the first 15 overs of the match, be it with the ball or bat is the team that gets ahead and wins that game. They have all got power, all got finesse, they have got different kind angles to create in the field," he said.Michael Vaughan said it was a 50-50 call when asked to pick his favourite in the second semi-final at the SCG. "MS Dhoni knows how to win World Cups and that goes quite a long way. There is something about him and World Cups and what he did after the tri-series is remarkable. Change of team and change of mentality. The change in the way they played in the World Cup after the tri-series," he said.Ganguly also feels that Kohli will be the man for the occasion and expects a big knock from him. "For India, I think, the man would be Virat Kohli. He had a fabulous Test series against Australia; his record against Australia is outstanding. He is one of the biggest match-winners in one-day cricket for the team and at the moment and he will be pumped up. Kohli will play a big knock tomorrow. Don't sledge him. That's my advice to Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc. Because they did that in the Test matches and he came out with four hundreds."Sourav Ganguly writing exclusively on our site, reckons that the semi-final will be a battle between Dhoni and Clarke. "It's gonna be a battle between the two captains. We saw how AB de Villiers gave the game away to New Zealand and I mean it when I say it. But tomorrow it will be a battle between two captains who are very good leaders. MS Dhoni is slightly ahead because he has already led the team to three world championship wins - one World Cup, one T20 World Cup and one Champions Trophy. Clarke has played in a World Cup-winning team but has not captained a World Cup-winning team. For me the pressure will be on Australia. It's a home game at the SCG. They say it's going be more Blue than Gold tomorrow but still the pressure will be on Australia."Finch expects the biggest game he has ever have played to be a huge occasion. "You can't put it any other way. It's going to be exciting. It's a huge opportunity to show our skills off as a team. We've played some great cricket over the last two years and there's no reason we're not going to go into this game confident. I think we've got every right to be," he said. "Whatever happens I suppose if we stick to our game plans and play well it goes a long way towards winning the game. It's about being aggressive without being over the top.""When you're looking to be aggressive with the new ball, having been here for four months has probably adapted their lengths a little bit. (Mohammed) Shami is bowling well. He's swinging the ball which is a huge factor for them at the start of the innings. They've probably played a lot more cricket here and got used to the conditions, the length you bowl and stuff like that."Australian opener Aaron Finch has admitted that India would be a tough team to beat. "There's no rocket science they're bowling well, they're batting well. They're going to be tough to beat," he said, praising the bowling at Mahendra Singh Dhoni's disposal.Here is an interesting bit of news. Aussie bowling legend Shane Warne spent a considerable amount of time with the Australian team during the team's net session on the eve of the match. Warne not only had a lengthy talk with skipper Michael Clarke, but also rolled his arms over and had the likes of Aaron Finch, Shane Watson and James Faulkner in a spot of bother in the nets. Since the SCG is known to favor spinners, the Aussies wanted to take the inputs of Warne in order to counter the Indian spinners - Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja."The Indian fans in general, I think, are wonderful supporters of the game. I think they want to see great cricket and they want to see their team win. But they also respect good, entertaining cricket, and I really hope we can provide that tomorrow for them," he said.Clarke also is bracing up to the fact that there will be more Indian fans than Aussie ones at the SCG on Thursday. He is prepared to accept that too. "I think it's a no-brainer. I think we know they will," he said in response to a question if he expected India fans to outnumber Australian supporters but pointed out that his team had got used to that idea by playing in India. "I think it's fine. We've played in India a number of times and they out-support us there as well.""I think MS Dhoni deserves a lot of credit for the way he's captained his team especially being defeated in the Test series and the tri-series to be able to turn things around. Obviously they're at the top of their game at the moment. So we're prepared for that. We know we're playing against a very good team that obviously won the last World Cup," Clarke said.Michael Clarke has conceded that the big-match experience of more Indian players could make a difference on Thursday. "I said at the start of this tournament that I thought India were going to be one of the toughest teams to beat. My main reason for that is because they've been in the conditions for so long. They've played so much cricket in Australia. They've worked out how to take wickets. They've worked out how to score runs, and they've shown that through this tournament," he said."It's been a long time. Seven years. I can recall that very well. It's really fresh in my memory because it was the first final of the CB series, and the great Sachin Tendulkar was batting alongside me, so there is no way I can forget that."Rohit also has great memories of the SCG having played a significant part in India winning the first final of the 2008 CB series. Rohit made 66 and was involved in a crucial stand with Sachin Tendulkar. "It was a very important game. We had to win that game and we were chasing 240-odd. So, yeah, we pretty much did whatever we wanted to," he said.There is a lot of pre-match talk before the game and let's get straight into it. Rohit Sharma insists that wearing the team jersey is enough to motivate him and he does not need someone else to pump him up for the semi-final. "It is important for me when I wear that India cap, I need to work hard. I don't need anyone else to come and talk or whatever it is. I bat the way I want to and I think I would make sure that nothing gets into the head. I just want to play my game. It doesn't matter what people are talking and things like that."Quarter-final: India faced Bangladesh at the MCG and after a few jitters while batting, posted a 300 plus total thanks to a hundred from Rohit Sharma. With the total on the board, the bowlers as they have done all tournament did their job and finished off their Asian neighbors well inside 50 overs to move into the semis. It was another commanding performance from the Indian team in the tournament and kept their unbeaten run going.India: India maintained a clean slate in the group stages. It began with a win against Pakistan at Adelaide. South Africa were humbled at the MCG. UAE were easy meat. West Indies posed a challenge, but India came through that. Ireland were taught a lesson. Zimbabwe fought till the end, but their lack of winning games went against them as India hung on and won thanks to Raina and Dhoni to remain unbeaten in the tournament.Quarter-final: Pakistan were expected to be tricky opposition in the quarters but except for the tremendous spell from Wahab Riaz which had them on the ropes for a while, Australia were always in command. Once they survived Riaz's spell, Australia cantered home to victory to set up a semi-final date with India at the Sydney Cricket Ground.The road to the semis. Australia: Australia began with a bang thumping England. Then there was a washout against Bangladesh before losing a thriller against New Zealand. The no-result and the loss to New Zealand meant they couldn't finish top of the group. Australia smashed Afghanistan then won a high-scoring game against Sri Lanka before having it easy against Scotland.There have been so many altercations on the pitch when India and Australia play each other. Two instances immediately come to mind. McGrath sledging Tendulkar in Nairobi and the little man returning the favor and Michael Slater's angry argument with Rahul Dravid in 2001 at Kolkata. Not to forget Monkey Gate in 2008. It will be interesting to see what kind of sledging and how far it goes in the semi-final.What is an India-Australia clash without verbals and sledging. James Faulkner certainly has raised the heat saying there will be verbals when the two sides meet in the semi-final. "I think there always is in the game, if there isn't you've got problems," Faulkner said. "It's the nature of the game, it's a semi-final, it's cut-throat. There's going to be words said and it's going to be a really tough contest. Neither team will be backing down."Sledging: "Make offensive remarks to (an opposing batsman) in order to break their concentration."Former Aussie great, Ian Chappell too picked out Ponting's innings as the difference between the two sides. "Ponting played magnificently. He is only a little guy but has a reputation of hitting the golf ball a long way. Anybody who saw him bat at the Wanderers that day will understand why. Once he started going, he let loose and hit some huge sixes. Virtually, by the end of the first 50 overs, the World Cup final was over."Javagal Srinath who was a part of the Indian side that lost the game was effusive in his praise of Ricky Ponting, saying, "The speciality of Ricky Ponting is his ability to win matches. It is not just about scoring runs. He had the capacity to maneuver the team and take them along."The 2003 World Cup final between India and Australia was expected to be a cracker. Australia were unbeaten in the tournament till then, while India had won 8 in a row before the final. But the Aussies simply blew the Indians away. The tone was set in the opening over when an over enthusiastic Zaheer Khan was hit for 15 runs and Australia never looked back. Ricky Ponting was at his brilliant best as he conjured up 140 runs - one of the all-time best knocks in World Cup history. Australia made 359 and the rest was a formality, especially after Tendulkar was dismissed for 4 in the opening over.Two days later Tendulkar hit 134 as India beat Australia to lift the trophy. These two innings by Tendulkar are considered by many to be his finest ODI innings and also the best innings played by an Indian against Australia in ODIs. Such was the impact of Tendulkar's innings that Shane Warne admitted to having nightmares of Sachin."But that will to win and desire to go through to the finals was there in our dressing room and some good cricket by all of us helped us reach the finals and we lifted the trophy as well.""That match itself was a memorable one because we went back to the dressing room [after a delay] and there was a fresh target. Not many runs were added but about four or five overs were deducted so the target became stiffer," Tendulkar recalled.Sachin himself felt the desert storm was a new experience for him. He told Sport360.com, "We were playing Australia and suddenly [there was] this new experience of a desert storm for me. I was worried because I thought, looking at my size and weight - I weighed a lot less then - I thought I was going to get blown away by the storm. I was moving closer to Adam Gilchrist, hoping that if I was getting blown away I was going to grab hold of him. Some extra weight always helps!""We knew that Sachin likes to be left alone and be himself before he goes out to bat. The coach or the captain didn't feel the need to instruct what the Little Master had to do out there in the middle once play resumed knowing that Sachin himself was aware of what had to be accomplished. He was his usual self - quiet and focused," added Mongia."Nobody in the dressing room went close to him and uttered a word."Sachin's innings was seen from close quarters by Nayan Mongia who was a part of the game. He was full of praise for Sachin and recollected that knock recently to Deccan Chronicle. Here is what he had to say: "On that day Sachin could have done anything. Such was his form and frame of mind. The picture of Sachin sitting in the dressing room with his gear on while the sandstorm blew across the ground is embedded in most of our minds."'Operation Desert Storm' as it has come to be known is actually the name given to Sachin Tendulkar's masterful innings of 143 which ensured India qualify ahead of New Zealand, into the final of the tri-series in Sharjah. Australia had set India a target of 285 and a sand storm had stopped play for about 25 minutes. After the break India needed 237 in 46 overs to beat New Zealand's NRR and sneak into the final. That day, Tendulkar was batting on a different planet as he took India single-handedly to the final. The match was made even more memorable by the commentary of the late Tony Greig who went into paroxysms of excitement whenever Tendulkar hit a six.We have set the bar quite high in our opening few paras, so it will be a dampener if we don't keep up with that. Two instances have to be mentioned when it comes to India-Australia clashes. In ODIs, especially. One is Desert Storm and the other the 2003 World Cup final. Let us go back in time and refresh our memories of those two matches, starting with Desert Storm.So here it is then. We present you India vs Australia once again, in a World Cup semi-final.

Breathtaking moments. So many. It is hard to pen everything down. Over the last decade and half - India vs Australia has come to be known as the rivalry. Even more than India-Pakistan and Australia-England. India vs Australia has seen some of the greatest action that one could hope to witness on a cricket field.The Chappells. Allan Border. David Boon.

Flair. Talent. Battles. Epic clashes. Rivalry.Preview by G Rajaraman:There are two reasons why Australia do not start overwhelming favourites in the ICC Cricket World Cup semifinal against India on Thursday the weary, end-of-the-season, fairly grassless pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground as well as India's competitive instinct, fuelled by hunger and intensity, lending a greater sense of balance to the high-voltage clash.A large section of SCG is expected to back Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team but the Indian captain will be well aware that his team and he will have to dig deep in their reserves to be able to stop Australia from setting up Sunday's title clash with their trans-Tasman rivals, New Zealand. If the teams turn up at the park with their A games, fans could get a game to cherish.India have had a fine run in the World Cup, winning all seven starts, but they will have to be well on top of their A game to be able to beat the strong and determined home side and get to within one match of having the chance to defending the crown, a feat achieved only by the great sides of the West Indies and Australia.To be sure, it is not beyond Dhoni and his men. The top three batsmen, Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli all relish the challenge of squaring up against the best bowling line-up. If they can extend that to Thursday's massive showdown, India can keep their tryst with the grand final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.India's bowlers have caught the eye by lifting their game and executing the plans admirably. Mohit Sharma's back-of-the-hand slower delivery could be one the handiest weapons on the SCG track that is not expected to be aid bowlers overtly. The slowness of the pitch could make off-spinner R Ashwin's variations of pace and Ravindra Jadeja's accuracy key, too.After spending an evening, sweating under covers as it rained over Sydney, the pitch was back under the charge of its caretakers, curator Tom Parker and his colleagues. Between sessions of rolling spread over the day, the pitch had a number of curious visitors, including Australia coach Darren Lehmenn, Chairman of Selectors Rod Marsh and his colleague Mark Waugh.Clearly, the curator's attempt has been to ensure that the pitch would be even-paced unlike in the quarterfinal where it started off being dual-paced and challenged the Sri Lanka batsmen. It would be important for the team batting first to ensure that not too many wickets are lost in the mandatory powerplay.Shane Watson's show of character must count as a positive spin-off of Australia's engaging quarterfinal skirmish with Pakistan or a fired-up left-arm paceman Wahab Riaz, to be more specific. His presence in the middle-order does lend experienced muscle to go with the youthful exuberance of Glenn Maxwell.New Zealand's entry into the title round more so as squad that has won all its eight matches in the World Cup can work as an extra spark for Australia, known to have a long history of intense antipodean rivalry. But as Australian captain Michael Clarke pointed out repeatedly, his team did not need such external factors to find the drive to win the game.Of course, Australia have not lost an ODI in Sydney in the last three years but that must be tempered by the knowledge that only one of those games the recent victory over Sri Lanka has been played in the month of March. And it is of some significance that India beat Australia in March 2008, with Rohit Sharma sharing a century stand with Sachin Tendulkar.The South Africans felt the crowd pressure a couple of times in the tournament, notably against India in Melbourne on February 22 and New Zealand in Auckland on Tuesday. Will it be the Australians' turn to be playing an 'away' game at home, given the hordes of Indian supporters who will turn up at the SCG on Thursday?For this one time, we can believe the truism that is often spouted in limited-over cricket. For once, let us accept that the team that keeps its nerves in check and expresses itself under pressure on Thursday would earn the right to take that flight to Melbourne for the ICC Cricket World Cup final against New Zealand.Teams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(c/w), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Axar Patel, Stuart Binny, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ambati RayuduAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Marsh, Xavier Doherty, George Bailey, Pat CumminsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
