BANGLADESH:17.2 Binny to Nasir Hossain, out Bowled!! That's a fifer for Stuart Binny! Last of the recognised batsman has been dismissed! Full delivery outside off stump, Nasir goes for the drive and drags it back onto the off stump. Wonder what's going through Rahim's mind at the moment! Surely, when they saw the target at the innings break, they would have backed themselves to chase it down with at least 10-15 overs to spare. Nasir Hossain b Binny 5(13)Binny to Nasir Hossain, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
BANGLADESH:17.1 Binny to Nasir Hossain, no run, outside edge but it doesn't carry to Saha. Binny keeps the seam upright and shapes it away, Nasir slashes and gets lucky

BANGLADESH:14.3 Mohit Sharma to Ziaur, out Caught by A Patel!! Ziaur, please stay away from the captain and the coach! That was a dreadful shot, if he thought he would take the attack to the bowler, Mohit Sharma out-thought him with a well disguised slower delivery. Ziaur advances and mistimes the slog high in the air, square leg runs back and takes a well judged catch. Credit to the fielder for holding onto that one as it went a mile up in the air.

Back into the attack, Mohit gets the short of length delivery to bounce high, Shakib tries to defend but gets an edge that is easily held by the keeper. They check for the no-ball but Mohit had something behind the line. Shakib c W Saha b Mohit Sharma 4(8) [4s-1]Mohit Sharma to Shakib, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Mohit Sharma [6.0-2-18-2] is back into the attack

Mahmudullah drives away from the body and gets a thick edge, gully parries it up initially and grabs it on the second attempt. How about crediting captain Raina for having a man at gully? Mahmudullah c Rayudu b Binny 0(1)Binny to Mahmudullah, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Mahmudullah, right handed bat, comes to the c
BANGLADESH:13.2 Binny to Mithun Ali, out Caught by A Patel!! My word! Acres of space on the leg side and he's hit it straight to the man at square leg! What are Bangladesh doing here?

Rahim c W Saha b Binny 11(24) [4s-2]Binny to Rahim, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

BANGLADESH:11.1 Binny to Rahim, no run, gentle outswinger outside off stump, Rahim was just ball-watching on that occasion
BANGLADESH:10.6 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, no run, how did that miss the off stump? Mohit can't believe it! Full delivery very, very close to the off pole, the ball just moves away after hitting the seam, Mithun drives and gets beaten. That is the length that you need to bowl on this surface
BANGLADESH:10.5 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, 1 run, defends the full delivery to the left of extra-cover, takes off late for a quick single, but makes his ground easily in the end as the fielder failed to pick it up easily
BANGLADESH:10.4 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, this short of a length delivery jags away and bounces extra too. Rahim was forced to play at that and he did just well enough not to nick it
BANGLADESH:10.3 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, nice and close to the off stump again, Rahim is solid in his defence though
BANGLADESH:10.2 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, FOUR, just a fraction down the leg side and that was good enough for Rahim. Waits for the fullish delivery come and glanced it away very fine to beat fine leg
BANGLADESH:10.1 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Rahim cuts it gently to cover-poin
BANGLADESH:9.6 Binny to Mithun Ali, no run, that's a sensational end to the over from Binny, he starts off with a maiden. Mithun was foxed by the late outswing on this short of length delivery, he tried to defend but was completely opened up by the movement

BANGLADESH:8.6 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, 1 run, 'catch it' is the cry from the Indian fielders as Mithun pushes hard at a short of a length delivery and gets a thick edge. The ball escapes past the slips to third man. Unlike Anamul, who hit a similar delivery straight to the fielder, Mithun has managed to send this finer
BANGLADESH:8.5 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, FOUR, that's not going to trouble the batsman. Mithun allows the fullish delivery to come, leans forward and drives it between cover and point to delight the crowd
BANGLADESH:8.4 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, 1 run, batsmen are reluctant to plant their front foot forward to ones that are pitched around the good length, this one bounced a bit more than Rahim anticipated and took the inside edge, it go through safely to fine leg even though it was in the air for a while
BANGLADESH:8.3 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, Rahim would be kicking himself for playing a rash stroke. Luckily for Bangladesh, he didn't kiss it. Outswinging short of length delivery from Mohit, Rahim slashes hard and misses
BANGLADESH:8.2 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, keeps it tight around the off stump, but it's not full enough to draw Rahim onto the front foot
BANGLADESH:8.1 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, evidence of ball doing its bit if hits the good length or further. This length ball nips back in after pitching, foxes Rahim on the flick and hits him in line with leg, but the angle was taking it down the leg side and hence it was a muted appeal from India. Maybe, height was also an issue there
BANGLADESH:7.6 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, ends the over with a short of length delivery close to the off pole, Mithun blocks off the back foot
BANGLADESH:7.5 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, Mithun was tempted on that occasion to poke at that nicely shaped outswinger outside off stump, in the end, he resists his temptation and lets it go
BANGLADESH:7.4 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, much better line from the bowler but the length has to be a touch fuller. Short of a length just outside off stump, happily handled off the back foot
BANGLADESH:7.3 U Yadav to Rahim, 1 run, sprays down the leg side again, Rahim glances it away to long leg
BANGLADESH:7.2 U Yadav to Rahim, FOUR, he gets greedy for a big outswinger after seeing the previous ball swing away from the right-hander. Starts the length ball outside leg but it doesn't swing much and in the end, Rahim helps himself to a boundary through square leg with a flick
BANGLADESH:7.1 U Yadav to Rahim, no run, Rahim respects a well directed outswinger by shouldering arms as the line was just outside off stump. How about slipping one back in from a similar line Umesh Yadav?
BANGLADESH:6.6 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, no run, testing Mithun with a fullish delivery outside off stump, the batsman simply lets it go
BANGLADESH:6.5 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, no run, somehow, Mithun has managed to keep this out. Short of a length, nips back in, ends up just outside off stump, Mithun, who was lining up to cut had to make the adjustment in the end
BANGLADESH:6.4 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, no run, stands tall and punches the short of length delivery to cover
BANGLADESH:6.3 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, 2 runs, Mohit will be disappointed with that ball. Short and wide, enough width to free his arms and Mithun cuts it away to third man
BANGLADESH:6.2 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, no run, inside-edges the short of length delivery this time but thankfully for Mithun, it doesn't go back onto the stumps
BANGLADESH:6.1 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, no run, huge shout for LBW but umpire Dharmasena was unmoved. Good call in the end as the ball would have escaped over the stumps. Mohit bangs this short, Mithun swivels across to pull, lack of bounce almost does him in, but luckily, it bounced just enough to seed the doubt in the umpire's mind. No issues with the impact as he was hit in line with off
BANGLADESH:5.6 U Yadav to Rahim, no run, back of a length and on the stumps, Rahim presses across and defends it with a straight bat
BANGLADESH:5.5 U Yadav to Rahim, no run, fuller length delivery outside off and holding its line, Rahim covers the line, lifts his bat and lets it go

BANGLADESH:5.3 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, FOUR, edged and four, on a good length and holding its line, Ali pushed at that, gets it off the shoulder of the bat, the ball loops over 1st slip and races away to the fence
BANGLADESH:5.2 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, another play and a miss from Ali, this was tad fuller and shapes away from off, Ali played away from his body and is beaten by the extra bounce
BANGLADESH:5.1 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, on a good length outside off and shaping away from off, Mithun spars at that and missesThat will be the supper break. The players will come back again at 19:00 Local time. Chasing a paltry 106, skipper Rahim would have wanted his openers to play sensibly upfront. Unfortunately, Tamim Iqbal was unwilling to spend time and perished the second ball he faced. Anamul Haque too didn't last long as Mohit Sharma got one to bounce extra to have the former caught at point. Umesh Yadav beat the bat on a few occasions but debutant Mithun Ali and Mushfiqur Rahim managed to keep their wickets intact.
BANGLADESH:4.6 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, short of length delivery well outside off stump, Rahim lifts his bat and lets it goThree slips in place.
BANGLADESH:4.5 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, a harmless length delivery wide outside off stump, Rahim is not going to play at those considering that this is the last over before the break
BANGLADESH:4.4 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, keeps it tight around the off stump, Rahim respects it with a forward defence
BANGLADESH:4.3 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, this one hits the seam, jags back and bounces extra, Things would have been interesting if Rahim had played at that

BANGLADESH:4.1 Mohit Sharma to Rahim, no run, Jinks throws himself to his left and makes a fantastic one-handed save. That was a certain boundary. Short and wide from Mohit, should have been put away, unfortunately Rahim couldn't get the placement right
BANGLADESH:3.6 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, leaves the final delivery of the over which is an outswinger
BANGLADESH:3.6 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, wide, way outside off. Yadav struggling to control the swing
BANGLADESH:3.5 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, FOUR, top-edged four as Mithun Ali was late on the hook. Pacy short delivery and the top edge carries over the keeper
BANGLADESH:3.4 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, defended to point
BANGLADESH:3.3 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, drops it in front of his feet as he fails to deal with the back of a length delivery convincingly
BANGLADESH:3.3 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, wide, way outside off, and that's a wide
BANGLADESH:3.2 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, so nearly the third wicket. Mithun Ali's bat was hung out to play the guide to third man, the ball seamed away past the outside edge. Lovely delivery from Yadav
BANGLADESH:3.1 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, swinging for U Yadav, but Mithun Ali leaves it aloneMushfiqur Rahim, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:2.6 Mohit Sharma to Anamul, out Caught by Rahane!! Gone! Two for Mohit Sharma. Anamul's torrid innings comes to an end. Could've left that alone, but hung his bat out to that short of length delivery outside off, the ball looped off to point. Again poor footwork from Anamul. Anamul c Rahane b Mohit Sharma 0(8)Mohit Sharma to Anamul, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
BANGLADESH:2.5 Mohit Sharma to Anamul, no run, very loose from Anamul. The ball is swinging and he goes for a big drive, the feet aren't near to the pitch of the ball and he misses

BANGLADESH:2.3 Mohit Sharma to Anamul, no run, short of length on off, solidly defended back to the bowler
BANGLADESH:2.2 Mohit Sharma to Anamul, no run, beaten as the outswinger rushes past the outside edge. Leaden-footed footwork from Anamul

BANGLADESH:1.6 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, back of a length outside off, seaming away, left alone
BANGLADESH:1.5 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, FOUR, wrong line and that has been glanced away. Down leg and just needed a tickle, which Mithun Ali provided
BANGLADESH:1.4 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, pitched up outside off and Mithun Ali is beaten. Went after it, trying to chase the drive
BANGLADESH:1.3 U Yadav to Mithun Ali, no run, nearly squared up. But Mithun Ali got his bat down in time to defend the swinging delivery

BANGLADESH:0.5 Mohit Sharma to Anamul, no run, so close to a wide. Tries to reach out to cut and the ball goes under the bat. The ump reckons it to be a legal ball

BANGLADESH:0.3 Mohit Sharma to Mithun Ali, no run, fullish outside off, left aloneMithun Ali, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:0.2 Mohit Sharma to Tamim, out Caught by W Saha!! Atrocious batting. Worst it must be said, if you want to use a harsher word. Came down the track, looked to slash a high short delivery, could only top-edge it to Saha. Mohit Sharma looks pumped. Why would you play a stroke like that is beyond me! Tamim c W Saha b Mohit Sharma 4(2) [4s-1]Mohit Sharma to Tamim, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
BANGLADESH:0.1 Mohit Sharma to Tamim, FOUR, Iqbal wants to end this quickly. Gives the bowler the charge and forces it through the off-side field. Rahane runs after it and tries to pull it back with a dive, but the ball beat him to the ropes. Good start by BangladeshTamim and Anamul are at the crease. Tamim is on strike. Mohit Sharma will open the attackTaskin: "I am very happy today. I enjoyed my debut. I tried to bowl fast on this wicket. Before the rain break, I bowled just two balls and when I went back to the dressing room, I thought I will do the basics right as the wicket was helpful. I am happy to take five wickets on debut. Now I am waiting for a Bangladesh win."Welcome back... The players are out there.Abject batting by India it must be said though. Their batsmen found the conditions too hot to handle and basic elementary mistakes were made like seen in Raina's run-out. It wasn't a 105 all-out wicket at all. It is also India's lowest ever total against Bangladesh in ODI's - their previous lowest was 191 in the 2007 World Cup. Since the innings ended before 6pm local time, the break will be just 10 minutes. Do join us in soon for the reply.The hero of the day - Taskin Ahmed walks off to a standing ovation. He has the ball in his hand and waves to all corners of the stadium. He certainly deserved all the accolades. He made the ball talk on his debut and finished with a five-for. He kept it simple, bowled straight, used whatever assistance he could get from the wicket and repeatedly kept hitting the pad. This lad certainly looks to have a bright future.2
INDIA:25.3 Shakib to U Yadav, out Caught by Nasir Hossain!! All over. That was coming. Yadav wasn't going to hang around. He went for the big slog sweep, had to fetch it from outside off, the edge was found and it ricocheted off Rahim's thigh into the hands of first slip. The ump confirms the dismissal.

INDIA:19.3 A Hossain to Binny, no run, short of length on off, defended to the off-side
INDIA:19.2 A Hossain to Binny, no run, Hossain is bowling well and an inside edge onto the pads saves Binny as he pushed forward to defend. The inswingers doing a lot of damage today
INDIA:19.2 A Hossain to Binny, wide, too much swing again, wide down leg and Rahim dives to collect
INDIA:19.1 A Hossain to Binny, no run, too much swing and that put off the lbw appeal, Binny feel over and was hit on the pad, but going down leg

INDIA:18.3 Ziaur to Mishra, wide, down leg
INDIA:18.2 Ziaur to Mishra, no run, short of length on off, Mishra defends to point and looks for the quick single, no chance there

INDIA:17.6 A Hossain to Mishra, no run, sharp short delivery and Mishra has to be quick to yank his head out of the wayAmit Mishra, right handed bat, comes to the creaseDrinks are on the field now. One more point to be added to the Raina run-out. He had the gloves in one hand and ran with it. He does it all the time - not an one-time event that. Anyway Bangladesh are all over India like a cheap suit.
INDIA:17.5 A Hossain to A Patel, out Bowled!! Knocked him over! Too much fancy batting from Patel this over and he perishes. Left a huge gap between bat and pad, was attempting an ambitious flick, leaving a huge gap for the ball to hit the stumps. The inswinger did the trick after hitting the seam. A Patel b A Hossain 8(5) [4s-2]A Hossain to A Patel, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:17.4 A Hossain to A Patel, no run, fine delivery. Seaming away from a good length, lures Patel into the drive, but the seam movement does him. Extravagant shot attempted and nearly paid the price did Patel
INDIA:17.4 A Hossain to A Patel, wide, down leg and a wide calledComing back to Raina's run-out. 1) He turned blind. 2) Turned the wrong way. 3) Didn't see the throw coming 4) Didn't dive. Game over!

INDIA:16.6 Mortaza to Binny, out Raina Run Out!! 1 run completed. Casualness of Raina has cost him his wicket. Flicked to the right of deep square and it was an easy two, but for some reason, Raina was taking it easy, the throw came to the bowler who flicked it onto the stumps. Maybe Raina wasn't expecting the throw at his end. He didn't even dive. Caught totally unawares. Bangladesh are on cloud nine. Two wickets in two balls. Raina run out (A Hossain/Mortaza) 27(23) [4s-3]Mortaza to Binny, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Disaster for India? Has Raina run himself out? The Bangladeshis are very confident. Replays show that their confidence isn't misplaced. Raina looks out. Out should be the call. Mortaza with the ball and flicks it onto the stumps. Lots of replays being seen by the third ump. Wants to make sure and makes the call.Stuart Binny, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:16.5 Mortaza to W Saha, out Lbw!! Yet another Indian batsman falls lbw. Right onto the boot. Another plumb lbw. Dharmasena takes his time and makes the right call. Inswinging yorker, angling in, Saha's bat came down at an angle, when he was trying to flick. The bat hit the boot, but missed the ball, which went on to hit the boot, right in front of the stumps. W Saha lbw b Mortaza 5(12) [4s-1]Mortaza to W Saha, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
INDIA:16.4 Mortaza to W Saha, FOUR, false stroke and finally Saha picks up a boundary. Was early into the chipped drive and he got it over the umpire's head. The ball raced away to the straight boundary

INDIA:16.2 Mortaza to Raina, no run, shuffles across and defends towards mid-on

INDIA:15.6 Taskin Ahmed to W Saha, no run, short of length on off, keeps Saha quiet, who defends with bat and pad close together
INDIA:15.5 Taskin Ahmed to W Saha, no run, fuller length outside off, that can be left alone and Saha does so
INDIA:15.4 Taskin Ahmed to W Saha, no run, corker of a delivery. Saha was caught in no-man's land as he got forward to defend. Once it hit the seam, it cut Saha into half, going right through his bat and pad gap, but bounced over the stumps. Rahim and Co. have a wry smile on their faces
INDIA:15.3 Taskin Ahmed to W Saha, no run, short and wide again, but Saha can't connect the cut well
INDIA:15.3 Taskin Ahmed to W Saha, wide, down leg and that's a wide

INDIA:14.4 Mortaza to W Saha, no run, darts back in and that draws a smile out of Heath Streak's face. Gloved onto the body by Saha, who looked very uncomfortable as he pushed forward to defend

INDIA:13.4 Taskin Ahmed to Pujara, out Lbw!! Look at Taskin Ahmed's roar! Plumb. Huge gap between bat and pad, and Taskin Ahmed has found his way through. Nip-backer, sharp one too, Pujara's bat came down at an angle, missed the defensive stroke, the ball screamed into the back leg. Would've knocked over middle at worst. Taskin is on fire.

INDIA:13.3 Taskin Ahmed to Raina, 1 run, steers it wide of point, quick single taken

INDIA:12.3 Mortaza to Raina, 5 runs, a very risky run taken but Raina has made it. It was pushed to the left of the bowler and the batsman set off, Mortaza ran across and hit direct after turning around, but Raina was too quickHas Raina run himself out? Or has he dived and saved himself. The dive has saved him. A full length dive too
INDIA:12.2 Mortaza to Raina, FOUR, Raina is lucky. Short delivery down leg, Raina got inside the line to pull and it looked like it went off the back of the bat, the shot was completed and as the bat came down in a circle, the ball looped off it
INDIA:12.1 Mortaza to Raina, no run, hits the splice of the bat, does Mortaza. A bit of extra bounce from a good length area
INDIA:11.6 Taskin Ahmed to Pujara, no run, a hugely enthusiastic appeal for lbw, but that was too high. Once again the inswinger troubles Pujara who cannot defend. The ball passes the bat to ping the pad, albeit on the higher side
INDIA:11.5 Taskin Ahmed to Raina, 1 run, an easy two, but Raina sends Pujara back. Mortaza was ambling towards the ball, but the Indian skipper didn't want to risk it

INDIA:9.1 Taskin Ahmed to Rayudu, out Lbw!! Rayudu is shaking his head on the way back. Not sure why, for that was plumb. Super delivery - fullish and swung in late, Rayudu had the bat close to the pad and looked to defend, but the ball was too quick for him. It thudded into the pad in front of off and middle, then hit the bat. Definitely pad first and that's the second wicket for Taskin Ahmed. The ump had his finger up in no time. Rayudu lbw b Taskin Ahmed 1(7)Taskin Ahmed to Rayudu, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
INDIA:8.6 Mortaza to Rayudu, 1 run, pushes it in front of mid-on and takes the quick single
INDIA:8.5 Mortaza to Rayudu, no run, gets forward and defends solidly to one on off
INDIA:8.4 Mortaza to Rayudu, no run, huge shout for caught behind. Rahim threw the ball away in delight after catching it, he was sure there was a nick, but Mortaza wasn't too keen. Didn't even appeal. Replays are in and it proves there was no nick. Another screamer from Mortaza as he generates bounce and inswing to rush past the edge of Rayudu - who played inside the line to that
INDIA:8.3 Mortaza to Rayudu, no run, back and across before dabbing to point
INDIA:8.2 Mortaza to Pujara, 1 run, dabs wide of point and asks Rayudu for a quick single, who responds
INDIA:8.1 Mortaza to Pujara, no run, Mortaza is shell-shocked! How did that miss the stumps? What a delivery that was. Went like a leg-break. Pitched on off and just as it looked to be hitting the stump after eluding the outside edge, it seamed away to miss the pole. Mortaza cannot quite believe that it hasn't hit the stumps
INDIA:7.6 Taskin Ahmed to Rayudu, no run, keeps it in the channel outside off, left alone
INDIA:7.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rayudu, no run, outie, swinging away, left aloneAmbati Rayudu, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:7.4 Taskin Ahmed to Uthappa, out Caught by Ziaur!! Taskin Ahmed roars with clenched fists. He deserved that wicket. Not all that short to be pulling and Uthappa makes the error of misjudging the length. Went for the stroke and the pace on the ball, found the top-edge of the bat and mid-off settles under the high ball. Wasn't caught cleanly, but that doesn't matter. No heroics from Uthappa today. Maiden ODI wicket for Taskin Ahmed. Uthappa c Ziaur b Taskin Ahmed 14(24) [4s-2]Taskin Ahmed to Uthappa, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Uthappa is gone.
INDIA:7.3 Taskin Ahmed to Uthappa, no run, sharp inducker, thuds into Uthappa's ribs as he fails to deal with that. That bounced and it took Uthappa by surprise
INDIA:7.2 Taskin Ahmed to Uthappa, 2 runs, short of length outside off and rising, Uthappa rides the bounce and guides it square of the wicket for a couple
INDIA:7.1 Taskin Ahmed to Uthappa, FOUR, full and wide outside off, Uthappa gets forward and puts it away, cover-driving to the sweeper fence. Just opened the face to get it away into the gap
INDIA:6.6 Mortaza to Pujara, no run, the bad ball arrives, but since Pujara is under the cosh, he can't put it away. Cut straight to the fielder at point
INDIA:6.5 Mortaza to Pujara, no run, superb delivery. Beats Pujara all ends up. Pitches around off and then seams away past the defensive stroke. Pujara was playing for the inswinger and this one whooshed past the outside edge
INDIA:6.4 Mortaza to Pujara, no run, the bat turns in his hand as he looks to drive, the mistimed shot goes to mid-on
INDIA:6.3 Mortaza to Pujara, no run, Pujara is looking very tentative. Once again Mortaza hits the seam and jags it back in appreciably. Pujara was looking to defend and misses, is hit high on the thigh pad. The angle would've taken it down leg and Dharmasena gets it right
INDIA:6.2 Mortaza to Uthappa, 1 run, drop and run! In front of short cover who responds, but isn't quick enough to stop the batsmen
INDIA:6.1 Mortaza to Pujara, 1 run, edged and doesn't carry to 2nd slip. Opened up Pujara with a good delivery - unluckily for the bowler the edges don't seem to be carrying. Come up a few paces, lads!
INDIA:5.6 Taskin Ahmed to Pujara, 1 run, sharp inducker, but somehow Pujara tucks it in front of square leg and races across to complete a quick single
INDIA:5.5 Taskin Ahmed to Uthappa, 1 run, seaming away, Uthappa opens the face of the bat and guides it down to third man

INDIA:5.3 Taskin Ahmed to Pujara, wide, starts off with a wayward delivery, way outside off, wide calledNice and clear as the players walk out to the field. Hopefully there are no more delays and we could finish the game. We are all set to go again. Taskin to finish his incomplete over.I will do the smart thing by pasting Mohandas Menon's tweet regarding the revised playing conditions: 'Play to restart at 4:00. 41 over a side ODI. 1st PP 8 overs. Batting PP 4 overs. One bowler maximum of 9 overs. 4 bowlers maximum of 8 overs.'News - the match will start at 4pm local time which is 3:30 IST. It will be a 41-overs per side game. As usual the innings break will be for 30 minutes. We could be playing all night!An inspection is scheduled at 3:30pm local time which is just 4 minutes away. Overs should be getting docked now as we have lost two hours of play. Waiting for official confirmation.Good news - the covers are coming off. We could be in for some action pretty soon.Mohandas Menon on twitter: 'Persistent drizzle continues at the Mirpur Stadium. This could continue endlessly ....'Scratch that last update. The rain has picked up again. This is frustrating. Imagine how it must be for the players.Some good news - the rain has stopped and the umpires will have an inspection soon. Do stay tuned to know what the update is.Brian Murgatroyd with some bad news. Here is his tweet: 'Still raining here, lots of water on the covers & on the extremes of the o'field. We're set for a long wait... 'Still no news about the weather conditions at Mirpur. The wait continues...Well we are off now. The drizzle has got heavier. The covers have come on now. It is coming down quite hard at the moment. In no time the entire square and the outfield have been covered. This is frustrating to say the least. Fingers crossed that the rain will pass and we will have a good game. Until then, just pray and keep waiting is all one could do.
INDIA:5.2 Taskin Ahmed to Pujara, no run, the second short delivery of the over. The ump calls it the 2nd short delivery of the over. Again Pujara leaves it to Rahim. Taskin Ahmed bent his back and got good lift from the surface
INDIA:5.1 Taskin Ahmed to Pujara, no run, good debut delivery from Taskin Ahmed. A sharp bouncer and Pujara had to be quick to duck under that as it flew over his head. Rahim collects it above his head. That delivery had some oomphTaskin Ahmed, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:4.6 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, beaten on the outside edge. This one keeps low and beats Uthappa tentative prod. And we have the first drops of rain on the ground. Not good news
INDIA:4.5 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, make that three leaves in a row. Probing away is Mortaza
INDIA:4.4 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, and again. Uthappa leaves judiciously outside off
INDIA:4.3 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, short of length and outside off, left alone
INDIA:4.2 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, bit of extra bounce, Uthappa took one hand off the bat handle and played it towards square legIt looks very dark and lots of ominous clouds in the background. The odd thunder could be heard in the background too.
INDIA:4.1 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, short of length outside off, Uthappa is back and across before pushing it to point
INDIA:3.6 A Hossain to Pujara, no run, solidly in behind that final delivery
INDIA:3.5 A Hossain to Pujara, no run, extra bounce from Hossain and it troubles Pujara. Looks to go on his haunches and tries to cut, but the bottom edge is found and lands in front of slip
INDIA:3.4 A Hossain to Uthappa, 1 run, superb short delivery. Nipped in sharply and hit Uthappa's bat as he hung it out like a periscope. Off the back of the bat and down to fine leg for a single. Fortune favoring Uthappa once more
INDIA:3.3 A Hossain to Uthappa, FOUR, even though Uthappa got a boundary, that was an unconvincing shot. No wonder Hossain had his hands on his head. Uthappa again got his front foot across and nearly fell over, the bat came down at an angle and luckily found the middle of the bat to race away to the fence
INDIA:3.2 A Hossain to Uthappa, no run, now the inswinger, but Uthappa seems to have figured things out for the moment, sees it well and leaves it alone
INDIA:3.1 A Hossain to Uthappa, no run, short of length and seaming away, with a bit of bounce, Uthappa shoulders arms
INDIA:2.6 Mortaza to Pujara, no run, again Mortaza is troubling the batsmen with his inswingers, this time the inside edge onto the pads saves Pujara as he looked to punch on the off-side
INDIA:2.5 Mortaza to Pujara, no run, good delivery - sharp inswing, Pujara though confidently defends off the front foot
INDIA:2.4 Mortaza to Uthappa, 1 run, risky run that. Pujara had to dive to make it in the end. If the throw from point had hit direct, Pujara would've been struggling. Uthappa just played it and set off
INDIA:2.3 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, pitched up and swinging away, Uthappa plants his front foot forward, watches the ball and lets it go
INDIA:2.2 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, good length outside off, hint of inswing, but Uthappa shoulders arms
INDIA:2.1 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, gets forward and drives well, but finds mid-off
INDIA:1.6 A Hossain to Pujara, no run, that's a maiden to start from Hossain. Tucked to the right of midwicket and a good sliding stop
INDIA:1.5 A Hossain to Pujara, no run, edged and short of 1st slip. Pujara nearly falling - opened the face on that and tried to run it down. The ball took the edge and didn't carry to the slip. Lack of pace in the wicket? Or the slip fielder standing too far back? Maybe the latter.
INDIA:1.4 A Hossain to Pujara, no run, back of a length outside off, Pujara pushes it into the off-side
INDIA:1.3 A Hossain to Pujara, no run, peach! Slightly wide of the crease and angled in, drew Pujara into the forward defensive stroke, the ball just about held it's line and almost kissed the edge. The angle suggested that it was the inswinger, that forced Pujara into playing at it. Lovely bowling
INDIA:1.2 A Hossain to Pujara, no run, and again. Nice delivery, back of a length and with bounce, Pujara again shoulders arms
INDIA:1.1 A Hossain to Pujara, no run, short of length and angling away, bit of extra bounce for Hossain, left aloneAl-Amin Hossain, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:0.6 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, gets forward and defends it towards mid-on to end a testing over
INDIA:0.5 Mortaza to Uthappa, no run, beaten! In the corridor of uncertainty, drawing Uthappa into the defensive stroke and the ball straightened to beat the outside edge. Super bowling from Mortaza, so nearly got his 2nd wicket of the over
INDIA:0.4 Mortaza to Uthappa, leg byes, FOUR, down leg and that's a poor delivery. All it needed was a deflection and it's leg byes as Uthappa fails to get bat on the flick. Evades the diving Rahim and races away
INDIA:0.3 Mortaza to Pujara, 3 runs, lovely eased drive wide of mid-off and beats cover too. The ball doesn't have enough on it to reach the ropes. They take three and that gets Pujara off the mark. Nice way to begin your inningsCheteshwar Pujara, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:0.2 Mortaza to Rahane, out Lbw!! This one is definitely out. Rahane goes for a golden duck. No footwork from Rahane at all. Misses the flick and his feet are rooted to the crease, once it hit the pad, it was plumb for the ball was heading into middle and leg. Dharmasena upholds the appeal this time. Very lazy footwork from Rahane undid him there. Bangladesh wouldn't be minding that one bit though. Dream start for them. Rahane lbw b Mortaza 0(1)Mortaza to Rahane, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
INDIA:0.1 Mortaza to Uthappa, leg byes, 1 run, close! Very close! Sharp indipper from Mortaza, Uthappa shuffled across to off and missed the flick. The ball thudded into the pad and a huge shout for lbw was turned down by Dharmasena. Was it angling down? That could've been the only reason why Dharmasena didn't give it out. Replays are in and I'm not so sure with that decision. That would've clipped leg at worst. Uthappa very lucky one must say. What a start that would've been for Mortaza and BangladeshUthappa and Rahane are at the crease. Uthappa is on strike. Mortaza will open the attackSo all set to go for the start of the game. The floodlights are already on. Still no rain though. Here we go. Mortaza to open with two slips.Rahane: 'It wasn't easy. First we fielded and it was really hot the other day. It was a great challenge and we are glad that we won the first ODI. We have the momentum now. I think, initially I really backed myself, in between went into a shell - was thinking too much about my batting. Now again I want to back myself, want to positive. It has been challenging - it's all in the mind, if you are really strong in the mind, you can adjust in all three formats. I've been working on my mindset.'Raina: 'Definitely we were looking to chase, but we can't control the toss. Happy to bat first, the wicket isn't going to change. Bangladesh have always done well at home, we have to be cautious. Later on it may seam a bit, that's why Binny is in for Rasool. We've to make sure we bowl really well today and defend.'Rahim: 'We will bowl first this time. The wicket has a bit more grass, we are playing an extra seamer, hope we capitalise on that. We have two changes.'Pitch report: 'This pitch looks completely different. Lots of green grass on the top. Should be lively conditions and help the seamers. Having said that, it should still be a good batting wicket reckons Athar Ali Khan.'India have brought in Stuart Binny for Parvez Rasool for today's game. Rasool was expensive in the first ODI, but he should've at least got one more chance. Or is that a tactical change considering the pitch? We will get to know when the captains speak about the team.Teams:India (Playing XI): Robin Uthappa, Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara, Suresh Raina(c), Ambati Rayudu, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Stuart Binny, Akshar Patel, Amit Mishra, Umesh Yadav, Mohit SharmaBangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Mithun Ali, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah, Nasir Hossain, Ziaur Rahman, Mashrafe Mortaza, Taskin Ahmed, Al-Amin HossainBangladesh have won the toss and have opted to fieldScratch that Shakib tweet, here is Mohandas Menon with some good news. He tweets: 'A drastic weather improvement here at Mirpur Stadium at Dhaka. Pitch covers too are removed. The pitch has a greenish tinge to it.' And he goes on to mention that Mithun Ali and Taskin Ahmed will be making their ODI debuts.The first ODI was hampered by rain and if the forecast for this match is anything to go by, then we are going to follow the same pattern. Scattered thunderstorms are predicted and spells of heavy rain is expected. Shakib Al Hasan has bad news on his twitter page: 'Not sure we will be able to get a chance to play full 50 over!!!!!' One has to wait and see if the toss is delayed, we will bring you all the updates, do stay tuned...India's only cause of concern from the first ODI will be the injury to Mohit Sharma, who limped off. If he hasn't recovered and the team management feels that he should be rested, then Vinay Kumar may get his chance. Apart from that probable change, India wouldn't be willing to make any other changes going into what they consider to be a series winning opportunity match. The toss and teams will happen shortly, do stay tuned...No worries for India as they look to achieve a 3-0 series result that would help them leapfrog Sri Lanka into 2nd position in the ICC ODI rankings. That should be motivation enough for Suresh Raina and his boys. Robin Uthappa continued his dream run in the first ODI by notching up a half-century. The format may have changed, but the runs just keep flowing from the stylish Coorgi's bat. Rahane too chipped in and the opening stand ensured a cruise for the visitors.Bangladesh weren't too pleased when India decided to rest a host of senior players for this ODI series - that nobody seems to be bothered about. But having said that, if they fail to win against this Indian side, then they will leave themselves open to criticism for their inability to put in a good show against opposition they considered to be weak. So it is imperative for the hosts to level the series, thereby taking the series into a decider. Whether Bangladesh can do so remains to be seen.When India sent an almost third string side to Bangladesh for the three match ODI series, the hosts would've been fancying themselves of causing an upset. Going into the first ODI, Bangladesh would have hoped to upset the applecart and make a winning start, but even a third string Indian side was too strong for them. The visitors romping to victory in a rain-shortened game. Hello and a warm welcome to the 2nd match of the ODI series being played at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur.Preview by PradeepHaving been slammed from all quarters for having sent an 'A' side for the Bangladesh ODI series, the Indian selectors would be justified in being proud of themselves after the team's impressive performance in the opening ODI on Sunday. Asked to field first in extreme conditions, the Indians did well to restrict the hosts to 272, before knocking off the revised score without much fuss.The confident Indian team will be looking to take an unassailable lead when they face Bangladesh in the second ODI. There is some added incentive for India as well, a 3-0 series whitewash will help them leapfrog Sri Lanka into the 2nd position in the ICC ODI rankings, and Suresh Raina will be eager to achieve that under his leadership.India:It was a comfortable victory for the visitors on Sunday night. The bowling was disciplined, and although they ended up conceding far too many runs towards the end, the skipper would have been proud about performance in difficult conditions. They were backed up by some tight fielding, although the skipper himself had a mixed day, spilling a sitter before making it up by grabbing on to a stunner. Umesh Yadav was efficient with new ball while Mohit Sharma struggled under the heat. The spinners, despite leaking runs, were amongst the wickets.Robin Uthappa continued from where he left in the Indian T20 league. Gone are the days of youthful brashness, the new version of the right-handed batsman has seen precision and finesse instead of raw power and aggression. Ajinkya Rahane, still struggling for a permanent spot in the ODI team, did his cause no harm with an attractive half-century. A rain-curtailed game meant that the rest of the batsmen did not get much of an opportunity to showcase their skills.Bangladesh:Mushfiqur Rahim's comments about the Indian team came back to haunt him as the 'weakened' Indian team secured a convincing win in the first ODI. He will be more than worried about the lack of quality in the bowling department. Out of the three Indian wickets to fall on Sunday, two were due to poor calls from umpire Enamul Haque while Rahane slashed at a wide ball and was caught brilliantly at short third man.Tamim Iqbal, back in the side for the first time this year after recovering from injury looked rusty, while the out-of-form Mominul Haque did little to suggest he should be batting in the top-order. Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan continued their recent good form, while Mahmuddullah and Nasir Hossain chipped in with cameos. While 272 looked like a good score, skipper Rahim admitted the failure of converting starts into bigger knocks resulted in the team falling at least 20 runs short.Barring Shakib, the rest of the bowlers were disappointing. Abdur Razzak and Mashrafe Mortaza have been pale shadows of their past while Al-Amin Hossain, despite all the hype surrounding him, remains untested. The hosts will need to improve their bowling by leaps and bounds if they are to trouble even this Indian batting line-up.Team News:Mohit Sharma limped off mid-way through his fourth over and struggled every time he came to bowl later on. If he is rested, Vinay Kumar will be the most likely replacement. With a series to be won, India might not make any further changes to the winning team.All-rounder Ziaur Rahman bats too low down the order and has hardly made an impact with the ball. With a must-win scenario confronting them, Bangladesh might well play an additional bowler in his place.Weather:Scattered thunderstorms are predicted during the 2nd ODI. Spells of heavy rain, just like the one that cut short the opening game, is expected.Quotes:Every international game will count. So we are not thinking about it [making a statement].
