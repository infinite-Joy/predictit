Shahzad b Malinga 1(2)Malinga to Shahzad, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.5 Malinga to Muhammad Kaleem, 5 runs, had that hit Kaleem would have been a goner! Kaleem tucks it in front of mid-wicket and Shanaka was quick to get there.

Full and at the pads, swung in a little and beat the blade of Mustafa. He was trying to drive but ended up playing all around it, the ball hits him low on the pads and would have crashed into leg. Was beaten for pace and the inward movement. Rohan Mustafa lbw b Malinga 0(1)Malinga to Rohan Mustafa, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Rohan Mustafa and Muhammad Kaleem are at the crease. Rohan Mustafa is on strike. Malinga will open the attackHere come the openers. Sri Lanka are in a huddle. Now they disperse and make their way out to the middle. As expected Malinga will get us underway, one slip in place and off we go...Sri Lanka have a history of running through the associate nations in big tournaments. But this time, it wasn't to be. Sri Lanka were 68/0 at 9 overs and they couldn't double the score in the final 11 overs. Credit must go to the UAE bowlers and fielders for keeping it tight. Although the surface's a bit tricky, 130 should be a chaseable target. But with the likes of Malinga, Herath and Mathews it won't be a stroll in the parkAs far as Sri Lanka are concerned, they would believe that they wasted a great start. After the end of the powerplay, they were 49/0 but from there on, the UAE bowlers tightened the noose taking wickets at regular intervals. Though opener Dinesh Chandimal held one end up to bring his fifty, he perished soon after, trying to up the ante. UAE had a brilliant lead up to the tournament and they have done their first job well so far. Do they have it in them to do it for another 20 overs (or maybe even less) to give a setback to the defending champions? We will know in a short while from now.This Asia Cup might be remembered for the pitches it has rolled out for the pacers so far. While it's a welcome change for the bowlers, batsmen, who have become habituated of playing at belters in the shorter format, are finding it hard to tackle the movement and the bounce. It became more so evident today as the UAE pacers got the Lankan batsmen to jump on their toes for the most part of the innings. In fact, the pacers inspired the spinners as well who contained the batsmen during the middle overs and did not allow much. For the UAE, captain Amjad Javed was the pick of the bowlers, returning with 3 for 25.1
SRI LANKA:19.6 Shahzad to Kulasekara, out Caught by Swapnil Patil!! And there's a wicket off the last ball. This will probably go down as one of the brilliant comebacks by an associate nation in T20Is. It was a slower short of length delivery around off. Shahzad got some extra bounce on that too. Kulasekara was committed to the pull and he ended up getting a top-edge on the stroke. The ball swirls high and to the left of the keeper who wanders around to grab that safely. Kulasekara c Swapnil Patil b Shahzad 7(7) [4s-1]Shahzad to Kulasekara, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:19.5 Shahzad to Kulasekara, FOUR, off the toe-end and into the boundary. Full and wide, Kulasekara threw his bat on the drive. Slapped it off the toe of the bat but had enough power to clear the infield on the off-side, raced away to the deep backward point fence
SRI LANKA:19.4 Shahzad to Chameera, 1 run, very full again, Chameera jams his drive towards long-on
SRI LANKA:19.3 Shahzad to Kulasekara, 1 run, very full, in fact a yorker, dug out towards long-off
SRI LANKA:19.2 Shahzad to Kulasekara, no run, off-cutter outside off, Kulasekara just lets it go, wasn't expecting the slower delivery maybeDushmantha Chameera, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:19.1 Shahzad to Kapugedera, out Caught by Ahmed Raza!! A FULL TOSS HAS BEEN HIT STRAIGHT TO THE FIELDER. Can you believe it? He has been asked to wait as the TV umpire is called in to check for a probable no-ball and the height on the delivery. It looks fine and Kapugedera can continue his walk back to the pavilion. It was just below the waist and Kapugedera has clobbered it straight to deep mid-wicket. Went deep inside the crease and hit it powerfully but picked the fielder. Kapugedera c Ahmed Raza b Shahzad 10(11)Shahzad to Kapugedera, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Mohammad Shahzad [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:18.6 Rohan Mustafa to Kapugedera, 1 run, full one from Mustafa, slammed hard to long-on
SRI LANKA:18.5 Rohan Mustafa to Kapugedera, 2 runs, Naveed drops a steepler. It was in the air and short fine leg made a mess of it. Kapugedera plays a slog-sweep and gets a thick top edge that went miles up in the air. Naveed might have probably lost it in the darkness, looked to get under but allowed the ball to sneak through his fingers
SRI LANKA:18.4 Rohan Mustafa to Kapugedera, 2 runs, comes down the track and slots the drive in the gap between extra cover and mid-off
SRI LANKA:18.3 Rohan Mustafa to Kulasekara, 1 run, on the stumps, cross-batted slog to long-on
SRI LANKA:18.3 Rohan Mustafa to Kulasekara, wide, flat and down leg, Kulasekara dosn't bother with it
SRI LANKA:18.2 Rohan Mustafa to Kapugedera, 1 run, another one full, nearly a yorker, Kapugedera manages to drill this down to long-on
SRI LANKA:18.1 Rohan Mustafa to Kapugedera, no run, right in the blockhole, not offering the batsman anything to work with, full and around leg-stump, dug back to the bowlerFantastic from the UAE. They have pulled things back after that 68-run opening stand
SRI LANKA:17.6 Naveed to Kapugedera, 1 run, good length on off, Kapugedera closes his bat face slightly and dabs it to towards point
SRI LANKA:17.5 Naveed to Kulasekara, 1 run, 141ks on and around off, Kulasekara goes hard on the drive and mistimes it towards mid-on
SRI LANKA:17.4 Naveed to Kulasekara, no run, short and outside off, Kulasekara rises on his toes and punches it to the left of backward point who leaps and fieldsNuwan Kulasekara, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:17.3 Naveed to Jayasuriya, out Bowled!! Yet again tries a similar shot and this time he makes no contact. Fast and straight from Naveed and this time Jayasuriya moved a little too early. The line was on middle and Jayasuriya couldn't get bat on the scoop. His middle stump takes a beating. Jayasuriya b Naveed 10(7) [4s-2]Naveed to Jayasuriya, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
SRI LANKA:17.2 Naveed to Jayasuriya, FOUR, slower length delivery on middle, Jayasuriya walks across, stoops low and shovels it over short fine. Calculated risk and he did well to middle the stroke
SRI LANKA:17.1 Naveed to Kapugedera, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Kapugedera late-cuts to third man
SRI LANKA:16.6 Rohan Mustafa to Kapugedera, 1 run, keeps it on the stumps, Kapugedera drives to long-off
SRI LANKA:16.5 Rohan Mustafa to Kapugedera, no run, full on the stumps, driven back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:16.4 Rohan Mustafa to Jayasuriya, 1 run, the TV umpire has been called out for a run-out check but Jayasuriya was just in there. It was turned in front of short mid-wicket and the bowler made good ground to get there. Effects a direct hit at the bowler's end but Jayasuriya did well to drag his bat in. Would have had his heart in his mouth there
SRI LANKA:16.3 Rohan Mustafa to Jayasuriya, no run, full, drilled back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:16.2 Rohan Mustafa to Kapugedera, 1 run, flicked away through square legChamara Kapugedera, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:16.1 Rohan Mustafa to Mathews, out Lbw!! Oh dear! Look what I mentioned in the last ball of the previous over. Mathews just tried what was absolutely unwanted. Mathews tries to go for a reverse sweep and misses the line of the delivery completely. It was fired full on middle, Mathews doesn't get any bat and it was going to hit the top of off. Pitched around middle and the umpire got it right there. Mathews lbw b Rohan Mustafa 8(9)Rohan Mustafa to Mathews, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Rohan Mustafa [1.0-0-6-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:15.6 Naveed to Jayasuriya, FOUR, offers width and Jayasuriya is happy to play a textbook stroke. Punches it past backward point and the fielder at third man had no chance. Tells us something about the pitch, ain't it? Better to go for the orthodox strokes rather than trying something fancy. First boundary in 49 balls
SRI LANKA:15.5 Naveed to Jayasuriya, no run, beaten neck and crop! This one seamed away late and got some extra bounce too. Back of a length in the corridor of uncertainty, Jayasuriya looks to guide it down to third man but was beaten by the movement and the extra bounce
SRI LANKA:15.5 Naveed to Jayasuriya, wide, races down the track and throws himself into the shot, looks to fetch a wide ball and fails to make any contact. It was well inside the tramline and must say it was a harsh call from the umpire
SRI LANKA:15.4 Naveed to Mathews, 1 run, hops inside the crease and clips this length ball behind square to bring up Sri Lanka's 100
SRI LANKA:15.3 Naveed to Jayasuriya, 1 run, in the air and in the gap! Pacy back of a length delivery wide of off, Jayasuriya throws his hands at it. Went for the cut but managed to send it wide of point (to his left), off the mark with a singleShehan Jayasuriya, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:15.2 Naveed to Dasun Shanaka, out Caught by Shaiman Anwar!! Naveed has his hands aloft. This is a very good comeback from the UAE. Fired it full and around middle, Shanaka looks to go over mid-off with an uppish drive. No feet and he toe-ends the stroke to mid-off who accepts an easy grab. Dasun Shanaka c Shaiman Anwar b Naveed 5(11)Naveed to Dasun Shanaka, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:15.1 Naveed to Dasun Shanaka, no run, 136ks full around off, Shanaka toe-ends the drive towards mid-wicketMohammad Naveed [2.0-0-13-0] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:14.4 Ahmed Raza to Mathews, no run, floated up and spun away, just a tad, punched towards cover
SRI LANKA:14.3 Ahmed Raza to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, comes down the track and driven off the inside half towards mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:14.2 Ahmed Raza to Mathews, 1 run, yet again, those beautiful wrists take over, nurdled towards mid-wicket but this time the bowler got there quickly
SRI LANKA:14.1 Ahmed Raza to Mathews, 2 runs, allows the ball to come in and then uses his wrists to work it wide of mid-wicket, good sensible batting thisAmjad Javed finishes his spell 4-0-25-3.
SRI LANKA:13.6 Amjad Javed to Dasun Shanaka, no run, Shanaka wanted a single but Mathews was never interested. Nudged this length ball in front of mid-wicket and was half-way down the track, sent back
SRI LANKA:13.5 Amjad Javed to Mathews, 3 runs, steps out this time and negates the movement. Javed dishes it full and Mathews slices the flat-bat drive over backward point, some bad fielding and a fumble ensured Mathews got three there
SRI LANKA:13.4 Amjad Javed to Mathews, no run, jaffa! This one jagged back a long way. Hit the good length and curled in to sneak through the bat-pad gate of Mathews, again he was trying to block but was beaten by the inward movement
SRI LANKA:13.3 Amjad Javed to Mathews, no run, loud appeal for lbw but Mathews was well outside the line of off, darted back in slightly from a good length and Mathews was caught on the shuffle. Was beaten by the late inward movement as he failed to get bat on ball - on the defence. Hit a tad high on the pad but was well outside the lineAngelo Mathews, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:13.2 Amjad Javed to Chandimal, out Caught by Shahzad!! He's picked the fielder to perfection. That was an ugly slog from Chandimal. Just got to his fifty and he could have stayed till the end - Much like how Rohit went about his business yesterday. Fullish and didn't rise as much as Chandimal expected. He swipes and mid-wicket fielder takes a tumbling catch. Did well to keep his eyes on the ball and reverse-cupped it in front of his face. Chandimal c Shahzad b Amjad Javed 50(39) [4s-7 6s-1]Amjad Javed to Chandimal, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:13.1 Amjad Javed to Chandimal, 2 runs, second fifty for Chandimal! Gets there with a free-flowing drive towards long-on. To be honest the second wasn't there but the fielder made a fumble there - Allowed Chandimal to get to his milestone
SRI LANKA:12.6 Ahmed Raza to Chandimal, 1 run, on middle and leg, flicked through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:12.5 Ahmed Raza to Chandimal, no run, innovative from Chandimal! Reverses his stance and goes for a sweep, looking to go over the fielder at backward point but ends up hitting it straight towards him. He was a tad early on the stroke and Raza did well to shorten his length
SRI LANKA:12.4 Ahmed Raza to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, quicker and at the stumps, wristed down to long-on
SRI LANKA:12.4 Ahmed Raza to Dasun Shanaka, wide, slider, down leg, Shanaka looks to work it through the leg-side but fails to lay bat on ball

SRI LANKA:11.5 Amjad Javed to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, there's the uneven bounce again! Kept a touch low around off as Shanaka was looking to play towards the leg-side. Ekes out a leading edge towards cover and went across for a risky single. Had to make a desperate dive at the bowler's end and beat the throw from the fielder
SRI LANKA:11.5 Amjad Javed to Dasun Shanaka, wide, looks to bowl too straight and ends up spraying this down the leg-side, beats Shanaka's leg-glance
SRI LANKA:11.4 Amjad Javed to Chandimal, 1 run, a tight single but Chandimal has made it safely in the end. Drops this back of a length delivery towards mid-wicket and sets off for a quick single, Dasun Shanaka responded in kind too. The fielder had a shy at the bowler's end but Chandimal was well in
SRI LANKA:11.3 Amjad Javed to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, fullish and this one kept low around off, Shanaka clips it to square leg and is off the mark with a single
SRI LANKA:11.2 Amjad Javed to Chandimal, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Chandimal hangs back and glides it down to third manDasun Shanaka, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:11.1 Amjad Javed to Siriwardana, out Caught by Saqlain Haider!! He's consumed Siriwardana. There is something on this pitch for the bowlers. Goes wide of the crease and angles in, short ball hurried Siriwardana into the pull shot. He fetches it from outside off and holes out to the fielder at deep mid-wicket. The fielder just had to move a few inches to his right. Siriwardana c Saqlain Haider b Amjad Javed 6(7)Amjad Javed to Siriwardana, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Round the wicket comes Amjad Javed

SRI LANKA:9.1 Amjad Javed to Dilshan, out Caught by Mohammad Usman!! With that Dilshan's misery comes to an end. To be fair, he never looked in control today and eventually perished trying to do much, the length was not there to be hit but he thought otherwise and swung across the line, miscued it completely and gave an easy catch to the fielder at deep mid-wicket. Dilshan c Mohammad Usman b Amjad Javed 27(28) [4s-4]Amjad Javed to Dilshan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Amjad Javed [1.0-0-11-0] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:8.2 Ahmed Raza to Dilshan, 1 run, flatter delivery and Dilshan waits in the crease, works through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:8.1 Ahmed Raza to Dilshan, no run, brings out the reverse sweep and fails to connect, I think he is trying too much here
SRI LANKA:7.6 Shahzad to Dilshan, 1 run, and goes for the paddle once again, does not get it off the middle, inside edge deflects off the pad to backward point
SRI LANKA:7.5 Shahzad to Dilshan, FOUR, that will be the third four of the over, swings across the line on this length delivery and fund the gap through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:7.4 Shahzad to Dilshan, no run, that is nasty, trademark Dilscoop but did not come off, Dilshan went down to effect it, did not judge the length perfectly and got hit on the helmet, good thing though was that he was not hurt in the process
SRI LANKA:7.3 Shahzad to Chandimal, 1 run, length delivery outside off, Chandimal dabs it away to third man
SRI LANKA:7.2 Shahzad to Chandimal, FOUR, that will be consecutive fours for Chandimal, short and on off, Chandimal makes room and goes for the cut, gets it off the upper edge and the ball beats the fielder at third man
SRI LANKA:7.1 Shahzad to Chandimal, FOUR, this is sloppy from the UAE, what could have been a dot ball has yielded four runs, fuller length delivery and Chandimal clips it off his pads, the fielder at short fine fline leg tumbled but failed to get his body behind the ball and it raced away
SRI LANKA:6.6 Ahmed Raza to Chandimal, 1 run, some air behind this one, Chandimal comes down the track nudges it into the on-side
SRI LANKA:6.5 Ahmed Raza to Chandimal, no run, flatter and outside off, Chandimal pats it from the crease to cover
SRI LANKA:6.4 Ahmed Raza to Chandimal, no run, was that missing the leg-stump? That looked close, might have gone down with the arm, Chandimal was flicking across the line and missed it, the replays attest umpire's decision as it was going down the leg-side
SRI LANKA:6.3 Ahmed Raza to Dilshan, 1 run, shortish and allows Dilshan the liberty to go back and work it in front of square on the on-side
SRI LANKA:6.2 Ahmed Raza to Dilshan, no run, touch flatter this time, Dilshan comes on the front foot but is forced to pat it back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:6.1 Ahmed Raza to Dilshan, no run, some turn for Raza, tossed up on middle and turning away, Dilshan pushes it coverAhmed Raza, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attackA decent powerplay from Sri Lanka's point of view
SRI LANKA:5.6 Shahzad to Chandimal, FOUR, that is the shot of the evening so far, not exactly a half-volley but Chandimal trusted the pace and the bounce, got a little stride forward and drove it through the left of the fielder manning mid-off
SRI LANKA:5.5 Shahzad to Chandimal, no run, slower delivery that completely outfoxed Chandimal, he swiped across the line and missed, lucky that the line was outside off
SRI LANKA:5.4 Shahzad to Chandimal, no run, short of a good length delivery on off, Chandimal prefers to stay back, cannot beat the backward point fielder with the dab
SRI LANKA:5.3 Shahzad to Dilshan, 1 run, hurled at short of a good length outside off, Dilshan stays in the crease and punches it to the left of mid-off for another single
SRI LANKA:5.2 Shahzad to Chandimal, 1 run, the trigger movement of Chandimal was on the front foot, he saw the length early and allowed the ball to come to him, opens the face of the bat and guides it to third man
SRI LANKA:5.1 Shahzad to Dilshan, 1 run, poor timing from Dilshan once again, Dilshan wanted to work it through the on-side, got it off the inner part of the blade to mid-on, enough time to scamper across for a singleMohammad Shahzad, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:4.6 Amjad Javed to Chandimal, no run, some comeback from Amjad, keeps it full outside off and gets the ball to move away, Chandimal is beaten on the cover drive
SRI LANKA:4.5 Amjad Javed to Chandimal, FOUR, this will hurt the bowler even more, this time to the other side of the pitch, fullish on the stumps and Chandimal clips it, the fielder at mid-wicket got low to his left but did not get fingers to it, the bowler is not happy with the effort
SRI LANKA:4.4 Amjad Javed to Chandimal, FOUR, that is creamy from Chandimal, poor fielding from the fielder at cover. Half-volley outside off and Chandimal drove it, the fielder at cover allowed it to sneak through and the quick outfield did the rest
SRI LANKA:4.3 Amjad Javed to Dilshan, 1 run, Dilshan is not getting his timing right, once again undone by the extra bounce, wants to tuck it from the crease and gets it off the inside edge into the on-side, in front of square and takes a single
SRI LANKA:4.2 Amjad Javed to Dilshan, no run, back of a length with some extra bounce, the line was outside off and Dilshan drove it on the up, mistimed it and the ball rolled towards cover
SRI LANKA:4.1 Amjad Javed to Dilshan, 2 runs, good running between the batsmen there, the fielder at short fine leg fumbled on this flick from Dilshan and the batsmen took twoAmjad Javed, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:3.6 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, FOUR, Chandimal throws the kitchen sink at that one, fullish on the stumps and Chandimal did well to get some bat on it, the best part was that it raced through the vacant region at mid-wicket. Good over for Sri Lanka
SRI LANKA:3.5 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, SIX, finally Chandimal gets something off the middle, he pulled it off the front foot, will definitely add to his confidence, he was committed on the front foot and the bowler kept it well short, Chandimal did not bother transferring his weight and pulled it with disdain, it just about crossed the deep mid-wicket fence
SRI LANKA:3.4 Qadeer Ahmed to Dilshan, 1 run, typical Dilshan swing, does not get it off the meat of the bat, swiped across this length delivery, perhaps got it off the inner part of the bat, the ball rolled towards deep backward square leg
SRI LANKA:3.3 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, 1 run, waits for the length delivery to come to him, gently dabs it to short third man and gets to the other end
SRI LANKA:3.2 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, wild from Chandimal and looked ugly in the end, took a little charge but the length was a touch short outside off, he went for the expansive cut but was beaten by the extra bounce this time
SRI LANKA:3.1 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, good cricket all around, length delivery right on the money, Chandimal drives it on the up back to the bowler, who makes the stop in his followthrough
SRI LANKA:2.6 Naveed to Dilshan, FOUR, the only thing better about that shot was that it went in the gap, Dilshan was looking to flick this length delivery on the middle stump, got it off the inner part of the bat and it bisected the field between mid-on and mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:2.5 Naveed to Dilshan, no run, and again, the extra bounce causing some problem to Dilshan, he was committed on the front foot and the ball rose from a length, hit Dilshan on the gloves and he seems to be in some pain now, the physio is out tending to him. I can see there is a protective tape on his left little finger
SRI LANKA:2.4 Naveed to Dilshan, FOUR, across the line goes Dilshan this time, not the drive he had attempted on the previous two ocassions, gets it high on the bat but still manages enough meat to get it over the fielder at mid-on, the ball races away to the fence
SRI LANKA:2.3 Naveed to Dilshan, no run, a replay of the previous delivery, Dilshan does not move his feet and goes for a similar shot, the ball just jagged away a touch to elude his bat through to the keeper
SRI LANKA:2.2 Naveed to Dilshan, no run, take that, that's a swing bowler's come back, keeps it on a length outside off and swings it away, almost kissed the bat of Dilshan as he went for the on the up drive
SRI LANKA:2.1 Naveed to Dilshan, FOUR, Dilshan indicated that he was coming down the track, made a little walk and the bowler kept it short, it was enough for Dilshan to get into a nice position and pull it, one bounce and over the ropes at the deep backward square leg fence
SRI LANKA:1.6 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, back of a length just outside off, Chandimal rides the bounce but cannot bisect the field through cover with the punch
SRI LANKA:1.5 Qadeer Ahmed to Dilshan, 1 run, similar line and length for Dilshan as well, the line was a bit too straight, Dilshan saw it close to his body and turned the bat at the last moment to work it in front of square on the on-side for a single
SRI LANKA:1.4 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, 1 run, soft hands from Chandimal and that will allow him a single, waited for the length delivery and patted it in front of mid-off, called for the single and got it easily in the end
SRI LANKA:1.3 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, better from Ahmed, comes closer to off and keeps it on a good length, Chandimal pats from the crease towards the cover region
SRI LANKA:1.2 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, FOUR, and with that Chandimal will have his first boundary, poor delivery from Ahmed, dangled it on the hips of Chandimal, he moved across and whipped it away to the deep backward square leg fence
SRI LANKA:1.1 Qadeer Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, keeps it tight on off, bowled at 136ks, Chandimal defends from the creaseQadeer Ahmed, comes into the attackOne slip for Qadeer as well
SRI LANKA:0.6 Naveed to Dilshan, no run, awkward bounce that hit Dilshan high on the bat, he was early onto it, just about managed to drop it in front of cover, good start from Naveed
SRI LANKA:0.5 Naveed to Dilshan, no run, back of a length delivery that hurried onto Dilshan, he was late on the swipe, gets it off the upper part of the bat to square leg, cannot steal a single though
SRI LANKA:0.4 Naveed to Dilshan, no run, this one jagged in a touch after starting from off, Dilshan pushed with an angled bat to mid-on
SRI LANKA:0.3 Naveed to Chandimal, 1 run, back of a length delivery on the stumps and Chandimal goes back in the crease, works it in front of mid-wicket and sets offNaveed is bowling with one slip in place
SRI LANKA:0.2 Naveed to Chandimal, no run, comes closer to the stumps this time, Chandimal stays back and pushes it to the fielder at mid-on
SRI LANKA:0.1 Naveed to Chandimal, no run, Naveed keeps it full outside off, Chandimal pushes it off the front foot to point, some swing for himChandimal and Dilshan are at the crease. Chandimal is on strike. Naveed will open the attackThe players have walked out to the centre. Chandimal is seen doing shadow practice. Naveed will open the attack for the UAE. Game on...Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Shehan Jayasuriya, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews, Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Dasun Shanaka, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga(c), Dushmantha ChameeraUnited Arab Emirates (Playing XI): Rohan Mustafa, Muhammad Kaleem, Mohammad Shahzad, Shaiman Anwar, Mohammad Usman, Amjad Javed(c), Mohammad Naveed, Saqlain Haider, Swapnil Patil(w), Ahmed Raza, Qadeer AhmedLasith Malinga: A lot of changes with senior members coming back. We are the defending champions but the T20 game is very difficult. We are looking forward to play good cricket. The youngsters are looking forward to play their game. We are looking to put good total on the board, we have a good bowling unit and hopefully we will be able to defend the total.Amjad Javed: We will bowl first. There will be dew factor, so it is better to bowl first and chase. We are playing with the same team that played against Oman.United Arab Emirates have won the toss and have opted to fieldFor the UAE, all eyes will be on opener Rohan Mustafa, who has been in sublime form. In the bowling front, Mohammad Naveed has got some raw pace and can be a headache for the opposition. While the UAE lack experience, Sri Lanka would take them lightly at their own peril. Stay tuned for the toss and team update...On the other hand, the UAE impressed one and all with their performance in the qualifying rounds, managing wins against Afghanistan, Oman and Hong Kong to earn a place in the main tournament. The task against the Lankans would be far more difficult and they will need to play out of their skin if we are to see an upset in the tournament.The Asia Cup got off to a flier yesterday after India got the better of hosts Bangladesh in the first encounter. Today, another Asian giant Sri Lanka take on less-famed UAE in the second game. Sri Lanka will be buoyed by the comeback of Lasith Malinga, who was missing from the side since last November. In absence of Malinga, Lanka looked like an average side. However, the islanders know that Malinga is capable of running through the best of teams, let alone the UAE.Preview:Sri Lanka have the perfect chance to put the 2-1 series loss in India behind them and begin afresh as they face United Arab Emirates (UAE) in their first match of the Asia Cup 2016 on Thursday (February 25). They will also be buoyed by the return of four big names - Lasith Malinga, the skipper of the side, Angelo Mathews, a key all-rounder, Rangana Herath, an experienced spinner and Nuwan Kulasekara, the Lankan seamer.Malinga's participation was initially in doubt after he missed the India series and Lanka would be hoping that he gets his rhythm as soon as possible. The sling-arm pacer hasn't played an international match since last November at home against the West Indies. UAE, on the other hand, will look to carry on from their good form and create an upset. They won all three games in the qualifiers and managed to make it to the tournament ahead of favourites Afghanistan. The format should give them hope as the game can change in a matter of few deliveries, but they will also need to be vary of Lanka's ruthless record against Associate nations.Match Details: Date and Time: February 25, 2016; 19;30 local time, 19:00 ISTWeather: Cloudy weather, thunderstorm expected late in the nightVenue: Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, MirpurSri Lanka:The Sri Lankan line-up suddenly looks strong and experienced after some fresh faces were introduced against India in their absence. With so many all-rounders in their ranks, the defending World Twenty20 champions will have to figure out their best combinations soon.It will be interesting to see if a track similar to the Bangladesh-India encounter is presented for these two teams. In that case, Herath's inclusion is unlikely for the game and might tempt the management to play Nuwan Kulasekera straightaway. But if a typical sub-continental pitch is on offer, then they could be expected to beef up their side with more spinning options.The likes of Tillakaratne Dilshan, Niroshan Dickwella, Dinesh Chandimal pick themselves at the top of the order. The middle-order will comprise of Mathews and Chamara Kapugedara with the big-hitting Thisara Perera to follow suit. They will look to slot in the impressive Dasun Shanaka or Shehan Jayasuriya depending on the condition.UAE:UAE will in all likelihood persist with the same XI that took the field against Oman in their final qualifying match. Rohan Mustafa and Muhammad Kaleem form a formidable opening partnership and the former's bowling abilities gives the side more options. He won the match single-handedly against Afghanistan with both bat and ball and the expectations from him will be high.Shaiman Anwar might not have spent a lot of time out in the middle during the three games but after his exploits in the 2015 World Cup, one will expect him to step up on the big stage yet again. Seamer Mohammad Naveed was mighty-impressive in the qualifiers where he picked up seven wickets. If he can make early inroads with the new ball, Lanka will have their task cut out.Teams:United Arab Emirates (From): Rohan Mustafa, Muhammad Kaleem, Mohammad Shahzad, Shaiman Anwar, Mohammad Usman, Amjad Javed(c), Mohammad Naveed, Saqlain Haider, Swapnil Patil(w), Ahmed Raza, Qadeer Ahmed, Usman Mushtaq, Fahad Tariq, Farhan Ahmed, Zaheer MaqsoodSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Shehan Jayasuriya, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews, Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Dushmantha Chameera, Lasith Malinga(c), Dasun Shanaka, Jeffrey Vandersay, Sachithra Senanayake, Niroshan DickwellaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
