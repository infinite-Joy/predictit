Despite losing wicket-keeper batsman Haddin early, Aus raced away to 76/1 after 10 overs. Ricky Ponting looked in fine touch with some gracious strokes while Watson showed his intent very early. A muisunderstanding, as it often occurs when a certain Watson is one of the runners cost Ponting his wicket and a poor piece of umpiring sent Watson on his way.Spinners get into the act: The strength of this Bangla bowling line up is their spinners and they continued their fine show as they kept Clarke and White in control. White, in particular looked edgy throughout his 50 ball knock of 20 before finding the man at long on. Clarke, though batted in a supreme manner keeping the scoreboard moving. It was clearly becoming evident that the run scoring was getting tougher as the ball got older. Michael Hussey , who joined at Clarke at White's dismissal was the perfect foil as the partnership gave the required momentum to the innings. Clarke paced his innings superbly to register his 6th ODI hundred, 1st against B'desh. Mitchell Johnson struck a few lusty blows towards the end to boost the total.Australia will feel that they have got enough runs on the board and considering the travails of the Bangladeshi batsmen in the recently concluded WC, it will be quite a task ahead for the top-order. Do join us at 13:45 local time (13:15 IST) for the chase.4

It will slow down later on, there are some cracks which have been covered by some dry grass. There might be some moisture underneath due to the early start.Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Raqibul Hasan, Shahriar Nafees, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan(c), Mahmudullah, Suhrawadi Shuvo, Mashrafe Mortaza, Shafiul Islam, Abdur RazzakAustralia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke(c), Cameron White, Michael Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, John Hastings, Brett Lee, Xavier DohertyBangladesh have won the toss and elected to fieldHello, and a warm welcome to one and all to our continued cricket coverage. A stung Aussies take on Bangladesh in the 1st of three ODI's here at Mirpur. Both teams are coming out of a disappointing World Cup tournament.Pre-Tournament favourites Australia looked steady for most part of the league phase without looking threatening at any point of time.They were eventually shown the exit door by the eventual winners, India as Ricky Ponting accepted that the aura of invincibility had faded and promptly resigned as the Aussie skipper. This is the first assignment for incumbent skipper, Michael Clarke, and he would look to start with a series victory.Bangladesh on the other hand will look to forget the hammering they received at the hands of West Indies and South Africa which led to their eventual exit. Shakib was the lone star for them throughout the tournament and he will look forward to start on a fresh note.Stay tuned for the toss updates...By Gokul GopalWhile the glitzy Indian Premier League would be the main cricket attraction around the globe, Australia and Bangladesh would be taking on each other in a 3-match ODI series, looking to put away their failures in the World Cup and build for the future. The main test for Australia would be the role the new skipper Michael Clarke plays and how the former skipper responds just as a player. As far as the home team is concerned, the main focus would be on Mashrafe Mortaza, who missed the World Cup due to a knee injury, and see how the the new inclusions in the line-up perform - Uncapped batsman Shuvagoto Hom and all-rounder Alok Kapali were the surprise inclusions.Head to Head: The Australians are undefeated so far against the Tigers on Bangladeshi soil, having won all the three One Day Internationals played. Taking the overall figures into consideration, the Aussies have won 15 and lost 1 in the 16 games played against Bangladesh.Team News:Bangladesh: The Bangladeshi fans would have been disappointed with the home team failing to make it to the knock-out stages of the World Cup and this prompted the selectors to ring in multiple changes. They decided to leave out former captain Mohammad Ashraful, Junaid Siddique, Naeem Islam and Nazmul Hossain while bringing in new-comer Shuvagoto Hom as well as the 27-year old Alok Kapali, whose last ODI was against Australia way back in September 2008. Also making a comeback is Mashrafe Mortaza, whose fitness would be tested under the gruelingly hot sub-continent conditions. The home-team would be hoping for an allround effort and try to prove themselves by playing some quality cricket against an opposition which is experiencing a few changes themselves.Australia: It is Michael Clarke who is at the helm of the Aussie affairs after the mantle was passed on to him by Ricky Ponting immediately after their quarter-final exit. His captaincy would be under close scrutiny and the Aussies would also be closely following what Ricky Ponting does in his new role as just a plain-old batsman in the Aussie ranks. Both Clarke and Ponting have started the Bangladesh tour on a positive note, scoring fine half-centuries in the warm-up match against Bangladesh Cricket Board XI. Michael Hussey and Brad Haddin also impressed with the bat, going past the 50-run mark. What is more encouraging for the Kangaroos is the emergence of all-rounder John Hastings, who was in his elements in the warm-up match, claiming figures of 4/13 including a hat-trick. The Australians would be looking to clinch the series in a professional manner and let Michael Clarke settle down as a the new skipper.Quotes:Ricky's advice has always been very helpful to me whether that was when I was his vice-captain or now as the captain. I have certainly said openly to Ricky that everybody in the team will continue to need his knowledge of the game and me definitely. His knowledge is crucial to the team going forward: Michael Clarke mentioning that Ponting's inputs would be valuable for the team.
We will have to do better than what we did at the World Cup. We have been fortunate to get another chance to prove ourselves. What we will be looking for is to play some good cricket. We might not have the same pressure we had at the World Cup and will be trying to put up our best performance against them: Shakib Al Hasan hoping for an improved performance.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Imrul Kayes, Tamim Iqbal, Alok Kapali, Shahriar Nafees, Shakib Al Hasan(c), Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Shafiul Islam, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Raqibul Hasan, Shuvagoto Hom, Suhrawadi ShuvoAustralia (From): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke(c), Cameron White, Michael Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, John Hastings, Brett Lee, Xavier Doherty, James Pattinson, Callum Ferguson, Tim PaineLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
