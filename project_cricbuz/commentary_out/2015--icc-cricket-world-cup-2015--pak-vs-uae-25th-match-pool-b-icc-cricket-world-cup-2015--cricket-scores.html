Amjad Ali is on strike. Irfan will open the attackWelcome back. The players are making their way out to the middle. Irfan will open the bowling and Amjad Ali will face the first ballApart from Naveed and Tauqir to a certain extent, the other UAE bowlers were very disappointing. They failed to put pressure on the Pakistanis, especially during the final 10 overs. Now, it is upto their batsmen to put on a show, but with Irfan and Riaz in the team, Pakistan will be confident of defending this total. Folks, take a break for now and be back in a short while for the run-chase.Both of them were looking set to reach their respective hundreds, but threw their wickets away in the batting powerplay. Sohail got out trying to pull one out of the park and Shehzad was run-out trying to sneak in a second, that too in his nineties. After those two departed, Maqsood and Misbah then took the attack to the opposition, by hitting a few lusty blows out of the park. Maqsood made a 31-ball 45 before getting out, while Misbah notched up a quickfire fifty and finished with 65 off just 49 balls.So, Pakistan finish with 339/6 on the board, the 16th time in 25 matches this World Cup that a team has gone past 300. Earlier, Pakistan got off to a poor start, losing Nasir Jamshed early in the innings. After that Sohail and Shehzad steadied the innings and played the balls according to their merit.

We discussed about it, identified what mistakes we did and are ready for this game. We will be bowling first. It looks like a good wicket and with overcast conditions, we want to put pressure on them. He (Shaiman Anwar) has been batting well. Hopefully, the other batters can also do well."Misbah: "I think nowadays every team knows each other, their games. Especially, the coaches are woking really well with them, specially Aaqib (Javed). So, lets see, we are ready and we need to play really. We are got the same team. And I think we are happy to bat first. The last two games we played here, it was a really good batting pitch. We also played well and in the last game, New Zealand also played really well against us. It is a good batting pitch and it is a really good chance for our batsmen to get back into form. Every game is important and we have no other chance, because we have to win every game. We have to play every game to the best of our capabilities. We need to be more professional. We need a clinical performance in both batting and bowling, especially fielding. We are ready for that."With many players of the UAE side having a Pakistani connection, it will be interesting to see how they go about their job against the Men in Green. Will Pakistan continue to employ the strategy of having an extra bowler? Or whether Nasir Jamshed will make way for another batsman? Stay tuned for the toss and the teams.McLean Park has been a high scoring ground in the recent past. New Zealand made 359 for 5 here against Pakistan last month, a game they won by 119 runs. It will be interesting to see whether the team winning the toss decides to bat first here. This game will become all the more important for Pakistan, who will look to boost their net run-rate.PakistanAfter losing two consecutive games to India and the West Indies, Pakistan finally opened their account on the points table with a win over Zimbabwe. Misbah won the toss, but his team got off to a poor start. Both the Pakistani openers, Shehzad and Jamshed were back in the hut with just 4 runs on the board. Misbah then steadied the innings with Haris Sohail, who once again threw it away after getting off to a start. Pakistan lost wickets from time to time and if it was not for Wahab Riaz's unbeaten 46-ball 54, Pakistan would have struggled to post 235 on the board.In reply, their bowlers did extremely well. Even though the Zimbabwean middle-order was threatening to take them the distance, Wahab Riaz and Mohammad Irfan made sure that they kept a tight leash on the batsmen. Both of them finished with 4 wickets each and helped Pakistan bowl Zimbabwe out for 215. This was a much needed win for Pakistan and even though it was not a convincing one, they wouldn't mind the two points they got.UAEUAE's last game was a one-sided affair as India thrashed them by 9 wickets. After winning the toss and deciding to bat first, Mohammad Tauqir's men failed to get going. They kept losing wickets and at one stage, they were staring at a score of less than a 100 on the board. It was only after Shaiman Anwar's knock of 35 and a last wicket partnership of 31 runs that the team managed to cross 100, but only just.Chasing 103 to win, India were never going to be put under pressure. After Rohan Mustafa's brilliant fielding effort sent Dhawan back to the pavilion, Rohit and Kohli made sure that they don't give anything away to UAE. Both of them finished unbeaten and UAE's search for a win still continues.11:45 Local Time, 23:45 GMT, 05:15 IST: The first game today is an all Asian contest, with Pakistan and UAE locking horns in the coastal city of Napier. Even though Pakistan is a much more accomplished international team, only two points separate these two sides at the bottom of Pool B. However, a win for Pakistan here will lift them above Zimbabwe for sure.
