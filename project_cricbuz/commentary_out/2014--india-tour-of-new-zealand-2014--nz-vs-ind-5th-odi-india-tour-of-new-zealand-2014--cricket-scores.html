In five outings, only once Rohit and Dhawan have added 50 or more and that tells the story. The New Zealand bowling didn't make life easy for them either. The lines and the lengths were bang on target asking a question almost every ball. Kohli and Rayudu need to share a big partnership if India are to avoid a whitewash here.

INDIA:4.3 Mills to Rohit, out Caught by Ross Taylor!! Was Rohit giving catching practice to his mates before the start of the game? He's done just that now, unfortunately, he's done that to a New Zealand player though. This was coming, they hardly were making an effort to get any runs. Yes the bowling was very good and tight but surely they could have at least rotated the strike. Nothing but a short of length delivery outside off stump, Rohit looks to guide it to third man, too close to the body to be playing that shot, in the end he picks out first slip who takes a fine catch to his right. Rohit c Ross Taylor b Mills 4(13)Mills to Rohit, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

INDIA:3.1 McClenaghan to Dhawan, no run, short and wide outside off stump, Dhawan looks to cut uppishly but misses
INDIA:2.6 Mills to Dhawan, 1 run, yes, no and eventually an overthrow as the fielder misses a direct hit at the non-striker's end, spoils what could have been back-to-back maiden overs for Mills.

Can the batsmen stand up to the charged up Kiwi pace battery?India who are winless on this tour, will have another stiff task on their hands, in trying to chase the total down. Whether they do so, remains to be seen. One should keep an eye on Matt Henry - reputed to be quick and sharp with the ball. Will India handle him and the others, en-route to registering their first win? Or will New Zealand continue their winning run? All the answers in a short while. Do stay tuned. We will back in a jiffy.It was once again the Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor show today. After the openers were gone, the middle-order tyros for the Kiwis stepped up to the plate with a 152-run stand for the third wicket. India didn't have an answer as they negated the spinners with ease, milking them to all parts of the Westpac Stadium. Williamson brought up his 5th fifty in a row, but couldn't convert it into a hundred. Taylor though, duly went on to complete back to back tons and was there till the 48th over.

Got his hand to the ball, but it went down. Loses the chance to get 100 grand. But good to see him smiling after that though.

It looks quite dry and hard. We will have to execute the blueprint we have talked about all through the summer. Matt Henry is making his debut. Anderson and McClenaghan are back. He will get as much support as possible. We will like to continue with the winning ways and make a statement to world cricket'.MS Dhoni: 'We are looking to bowl first on a surface that won't change much. The wicket is quite hard. It is quite similar to the Napier wicket. It is all about building on pressure and how individuals react to pressure. It is important to get off to a get start and convert it. The bowlers will have to work in partnerships. We are looking for a win in the last game'.With Dhawan coming back, Stuart Binny has been relegated to the sidelines. Matt Henry, who has has trumpeted by the New Zealand selectors in the same breath as Bennett and Milne has been handed his debut. So New Zealand unleash another quick on the Indian batsmen, who have been found wanting against the short ball.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Matt Henry, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghanIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Varun Aaron, Mohammed ShamiIndia have won the toss and have opted to fieldThis may be an inconsequential rubber but with New Zealand in red hot form and India desperate to eke out a victory in addition to gaining some valuable preparation ahead of the World Cup, an engaging duel awaits us. Good day and welcome to the fifth and final ODI at Wellington. Toss and team details to follow shortly...Baz, who sealed the series with a six in Hamilton has already warned India that the hosts will not be resting on their heels and will look to carry on the momentum to finish the series 4-0. Uncapped pacer, Matt Henry has been called up as a cover for Southee and Anderson, both of whom are carrying niggles. For India, It will be interesting to view if Ishwar Pandey and Amit Mishra get a look in today. With Dhoni confirming the fact that Kohli opening the batting was just a minor aberration, Dhawan is expected to return to the team and occupy the top order alongside Rohit.The mighty mauled. Pride tattered. The series out of grasp. The Number 1 ranking snatched away. With all the question marks swelling to a crescendo, MS Dhoni will expect his men, particularly the bowlers, to come out with all guns blazing to snap India's 7-match winless streak in ODIs. Meanwhile, it has been quite rosy for New Zealand, barring the tied encounter.PreviewThe series is gone. India now only have pride to play for against New Zealand in the fifth and final ODI at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington on Friday. MS Dhoni's plans of getting acclimatised to these conditions ahead of the World Cup have crashed as his bowlers continued to disappoint. Barring some spectacular innings, India have had nothing to take away from the ODIs so far. New Zealand on the other hand have sent out a strong signal to the world - they won't be easy meat in next year's event.New Zealand: Brendon McCullum's leadership, New Zealand's batting and some intelligent bowling against a powerful batting line-up have been the biggest positives for the hosts. They dominated West Indies earlier this year but their real test was always going to be against India.New Zealand had travelled to India months before the 2011 World Cup and Gautam Gambhir had led a routing of the Black Caps. India were ready for the mega event at home. Likewise, this could be New Zealand's moment ahead of 2015. The likes of Kane Williamson, Corey Anderson and Tim Southee will be key while senior batsmen Ross Taylor, Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum have just emphasised their class through the series.With the Test series starting next week, New Zealand will leave nothing to chance and they would be desperate to finish the ODIs on a high before the first of two Tests starts on February 6.Key Players: Williamson has scored four half-centuries from four games in the series, Taylor has two fifties and a century, Guptill has been strong at the top, Anderson has been dangerous with both bat and ball, Southee has taken key wickets at crucial times as has McClenaghan. Pretty much all the New Zealand players have been in top form, which explains their sheer consistency through the series.India: This has been a wasted opportunity for the visitors. MS Dhoni is the kind of captain who believes in planning long term and he would have banked on the ODIs against New Zealand to get some valuable practice ahead of the World Cup. But he has been left disappointed by his bowlers, whose lack of discipline led to the debacle. It won't be fair to blame just the bowlers though, as the batting has not been top notch either.Maybe Dhoni will take something back from the series, maybe the bowlers have learnt some valuable lessons on the length to bowled in New Zealand or maybe not. A livid Indian captain urged his bowlers to use their brains in a rare public outburst. Can they do it on Friday before the Test series get underway? Or will it be another familiar tale? It has been a frustrating series with the bowlers repeating their mistakes and the batsmen getting out at key moments.It is likely India will make some changes for the final game. Shikhar Dhawan will be back after missing the fourth ODI as Virat Kohli slips back to his usual number three to give the middle order more solidity. Suresh Raina is likely to sit out again as India persist with Ambati Rayudu for the second game on the trot.Key Players: Dhoni has been India's best player in the series with scores of 40, 56, 50 and 79 not out and is now just one short of 8000 ODI runs. The captain has led from the front but his men have refused to follow his example. Virat Kohli was outstanding in the first two matches but failed to get going for the next two. However, he is too good a player to miss out for long.The biggest positive for India has been Ravindra Jadeja's all-round show - two successive, unbeaten fifties and economical spells seem to have solved India's problems of a genuine all-rounder.Quotes:The spinners bowled quite well and then the fast bowlers came back on and they again gave away runs freely, which meant that we weren't able to hang on to the pressure created by the spinners. It was a disappointing bowling performance from the fast bowlers. - MS Dhoni, India captainTo beat a very, very good Indian team, especially in these conditions which I thought were more favourable to them, it was an emphatic win. We closed out the series which we have been talking about all through the summer, so we are really pleased with the effort. - Brendon McCullum, New Zealand captainTeams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghan, James Neesham, Adam Milne, Hamish Bennett, Matt HenryIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ajinkya Rahane, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Stuart Binny, Ishwar Pandey, Varun Aaron, Ambati Rayudu, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit MishraLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
