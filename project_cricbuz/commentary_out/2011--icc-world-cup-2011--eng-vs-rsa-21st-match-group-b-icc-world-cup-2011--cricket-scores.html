We are going in with the same team. If all of us perform, then we can get the results. Imran is a good bowler and we have guys who step up to the plate. England have performed well against us and we will not be taking them lightly.Strauss: It is a very good wicket and the pitch will deteriorate as the game goes on. Bopara replaces Collingwood. It is an issue of both form and fitness for Collingwood. There are a few niggles in the camp but all of them are ready to go. We have all played against Tahir before and he is a good bowler.England have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: There is a little bit of dead grass that is rolled in. The pitch is absolutely flat and there will be no help for the seamers. There is a bit in it for the spinners and it is a wonderful batting wicket.Hello and Welcome to the big game between England versus South Africa at Chennai. This is a must win game for England after their shocking loss to Ireland. South Africa will be looking to continue with their winning momentum. England need to get their act together, while South Africa will use Imran Tahir to exploit England's weakness against leg spin.The Preview by Vishaal LoganathanThe stakes are high for England in the clash of titans when they take on South Africa. England were served a severe blow when they lost to minnows, Ireland, a team they were expected to beat comfortably. England would do well to forget the horrific display against Ireland and focus on the South African game.
South Africa, on the other hand, sit pretty on the top of the table with 2 massive wins and are already look like one of the best teams at the World Cup.England:England have been brought down to earth in shocking fashion, by a team amongst the least expected to do it. Ireland's spectacular win has put England in a precarious position, and another loss at the hands of South Africa will leave them hanging by a thread for a spot in the last 8. They will come out hard, no doubt, but will that be enough for them to beat the red-hot South African side is the question for many.
The batting department looks well set with most of them looking in good touch. Captain, Andrew Strauss has been in prime form, scoring a brilliant century to tie the match against India apart from an impressive 50 in the first game against Netherlands. Jonathan Trott too has proved to be a good bet with the bat while Kevin Pietersen has impressed in the opening position. With the in form Ian Bell, and then Paul Collingwood, Matt Prior and the likes to follow, England's batting is the least of their worries.
Their bowling and fielding have been close to atrocious throughout the series. Yes they were undone by the brilliance of Ryan ten Doeschate first, Sachin Tendulkar next and most recently by a pink haired burly Irish middle order bat called Kevin O'Brien, but with a bowling line up consisting of the likes of James Anderson and Graeme Swann among others, the team will be terribly disappointed with their performance. The bowlers have conceded more than 290 runs on all 3 occasion, and with the South African batsmen in superb form, that sounds alarm bells for the English team.South Africa:.
South Africa came into the tournament as favourites, not for the first time, and they have started superbly, again not for the first time. On present form, South Africa go into the game as comfortable favourites but they will have to be wary of complacence.
The Proteas' batting line up is studded with big names, and they haven't let anyone down with their performances. Hashim Amla returned to normalcy (scoring big) after a rare failure against West Indies. AB de Villiers showed that he can fire with or without the keeping responsibilities, taking the Man of the Match awards in both the games with back to back hundreds.
The quality of their bowling department has been upped a great deal with the inclusion of Imran Tahir. The leg spinner has exceeded expectations with his bowling and has already picked up wickets in heaps. Add to that, the pace of Dale Steyn, the bounce of Morne Morkel, the experience of Jacques Kallis and the guile of Johan Botha and you have a complete package. Their bowling delivered the goods in their opening match, restricting the Windies for a sub par 222 and backed that up by ripping through the Netherlands line up, evetually bowling them out for 120.Head to head:South Africa have played England 44 times, winning 23 of those. There was 1 tied match and 2 no-results.Quotes:Andrew Strauss: "There's still opportunity for us to win this World Cup, still opportunity for us to improve and react better to these conditions. We have not done it so far, we need to do it pretty quickly.
Graeme Smith: We just have to come out tomorrow, be solid, consistent and perform our roles. Hopefully, we can be one step ahead of England.
