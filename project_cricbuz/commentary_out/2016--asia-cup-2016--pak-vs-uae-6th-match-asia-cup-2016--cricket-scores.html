PAKISTAN:18.4 18.4Naveed to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, Pakistan have done the job. And fittingly, it's Malik to put the final nail. Shortish outside off, cuts it behind point and then calmly hugs his partner on a job well done
PAKISTAN:18.3 Naveed to Shoaib Malik, no run, short of length delivery patted in front of backward point. Malik tries to nick a single, sent back
PAKISTAN:18.2 Naveed to U Akmal, 1 run, sliced down to third man and it's a half-century for Akmal. Takes off his helmet, kisses the badge and gets a warm embrace from Malik. Tried to finish it with a blast, came down the track and wanted to carve it over extra-cover, was out of his reach though as he backed away, ended up slicing it
PAKISTAN:18.1 Naveed to U Akmal, no run, surprises Akmal with a bit of extra bounce from a short of length, also nips back to hit the high part of the inside edge and rolls away towards mid-wicketMohammad Naveed [3.0-0-23-0] is back into the attackOne hit away now...
PAKISTAN:17.6 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, SIX, another one has left the Earth and landed in the stands over deep mid-wicket. It was an off-cutter, Malik picked it, waited for it and then heaved it with a furious willow. Nailed it
PAKISTAN:17.5 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, no run, length ball on off, and a forward defence. I promise, a good solid block
PAKISTAN:17.4 Amjad Javed to U Akmal, 1 run, clipped off the pads to deep mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:17.3 Amjad Javed to U Akmal, SIX, this is an assault. Pakistan are hurtling towards the finish line. Half-volley on middle, Akmal clears the front leg and whacks it over wide long-on
PAKISTAN:17.2 Amjad Javed to U Akmal, FOUR, slower short ball outside off, bounces spongily and Akmal has controlled it beautifully. Rises on his toes, waits for it to come on and back-cuts it splitting short third man and backward point
PAKISTAN:17.1 Amjad Javed to U Akmal, SIX, it's all crumbling apart for UAE. They've fought so hard. But now the inexperience is showing. Quite starkly I'm afraid. Full toss on leg-stump, Akmal flogged hard and whipped it over the square leg fenceAmjad Javed [3.0-0-13-3] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:16.6 Rohan Mustafa to U Akmal, 1 run, moves with the ball down the leg-side, and whips it to deep mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:16.5 Rohan Mustafa to U Akmal, no run, another solid block to a flatter ball on the stumps
PAKISTAN:16.4 Rohan Mustafa to U Akmal, no run, darted on middle and leg, Akmal is quite prepared now to defend with the required rate well within control
PAKISTAN:16.3 Rohan Mustafa to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, fired in on the pads, flicked through mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:16.2 Rohan Mustafa to Shoaib Malik, SIX, and again. This goes the distance. What's more, it's fifty for Shoaib Malik. He's taking Pakistan towards victory. Dances down to a full toss and clouts it high over the deep mid-wicket fence
PAKISTAN:16.1 Rohan Mustafa to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, Malik is feasting now. Full toss from round the wicket, slogged away over mid-wicketRohan Mustafa [2.0-0-8-0] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:15.6 Shahzad to U Akmal, no run, well bowled. Right in the blockhole and squeezed into the off-side
PAKISTAN:15.5 Shahzad to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, Usman Mushtaq has shelled a dolly and is now facing the fury of his captain. He is getting an absolute lambaste. Short ball which gets very big on Malik, but he still tries to hook it from over his head, never in control, the top edge loops to deep backward square where Mushtaq runs in, and it hit the heel of his palms and slipped out
PAKISTAN:15.4 Shahzad to Shoaib Malik, no run, darted into the blockhole on off, dug out
PAKISTAN:15.3 Shahzad to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, that's the tranquility Malik brings to this Pakistani lineup. He's rebuilt the chase so smoothly after those early jolts. And now is cashing in on some inexperience. Shimmies down to a full toss and drives it through extra-cover
PAKISTAN:15.2 Shahzad to U Akmal, 1 run, ha, he tried to absolutely smoke the length ball, but it was pretty wide of off, could only swat it off the bottom of the bat towards long-on
PAKISTAN:15.1 Shahzad to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, goes for the yorker but overcooks it and dishes out a full toss instead, driven to long-onMohammad Shahzad [3.0-0-12-0] is back into the attackThe last couple of overs have allowed Pakistan to stay in touch with the rate. With 7 wickets in the kitty, they should sail home. Focus on the word 'should'
PAKISTAN:14.6 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, drifting in with the arm towards middle and leg, nudged into the on-side and Malik will keep the strike
PAKISTAN:14.5 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, no run, flatter just outside off, flat-footedly patted towards cover
PAKISTAN:14.4 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, SIX, down the track and bang! Got right to the pitch of the ball, also beside it to swing through the line over long-on. Lovely flow of the batMalik backs away late, so late that Raza goes through and delivers. Dead ball..
PAKISTAN:14.3 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, no run, flatter and sliding on towards middle and leg, punched to mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:14.2 Ahmed Raza to U Akmal, 1 run, tossed up full on off, whipped in the air and lands just short of deep mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:14.1 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, Raza dares to keep it slower on off, but what he did well was cleverly pull the length back, Malik can only clip it through the vacant mid-wicket region. There was a thought given to a second, but that was quickly abandonedAhmed Raza [2.0-0-11-0] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:13.6 Naveed to U Akmal, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, Akmal tries to run it down to third man with an angled bat but when you offer so little of the willow, chances are that you aren't going to come off trumps. Fails to connect. A fruitful over then with 11 coming off it
PAKISTAN:13.5 Naveed to U Akmal, no run, oooh, risky. Naveed is tempting fate here. Almost a similar good length ball like the previous one, but what he did on this occasion was put more effort. The pitch responded and the ball bounced over Akmal's swinging willow
PAKISTAN:13.4 Naveed to U Akmal, SIX, utterly mowed over mid-wicket. Right in the slot on a good length just outside off, well within Akmal's vicinity and he unleashes a big hoick. Gets it right off the middle and it disappears
PAKISTAN:13.3 Naveed to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, seeing the previous one disappear, Naveed digs it in on a short of length, gets it to climb towards Malik's ribcage and he tucks it behind square for a single
PAKISTAN:13.2 Naveed to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, there's the boundary. Malik has infused the full ball with some good velocity using a lot of bottom hand to swat it wide of a chasing long-on. The fielder puts in a desperate dive in the deep but can't get a hand
PAKISTAN:13.1 Naveed to Shoaib Malik, no run, length ball just outside off, Malik prods towards it and punches on the up to coverMohammad Naveed [2.0-0-12-0] is back into the attackIt's high time I think to unload. Can't let the rate get too far out of hand. Already moving towards 10 rpo..
PAKISTAN:12.6 Rohan Mustafa to U Akmal, 2 runs, makes room and goes for an inside out drive over extra cover, went with soft hands and got it over the fielder. Some good running between the wickets takes care of the rest
PAKISTAN:12.5 Rohan Mustafa to U Akmal, no run, on and around leg-stump again, Akmal goes for the glance but short fine is in business again
PAKISTAN:12.4 Rohan Mustafa to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, full toss on leg-stump, Malik muscles it through mid-wicket, didn't time it that well. He certainly missed out on many deliveries that deserved a boundary
PAKISTAN:12.3 Rohan Mustafa to U Akmal, 1 run, allows the ball to drift in and turns it behind square leg
PAKISTAN:12.2 Rohan Mustafa to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, very full on middle, Malik goes for the cross-batted swat, toe-ends it to wide long-on

PAKISTAN:11.6 Fahad Tariq to U Akmal, no run, back of a length on off, Akmal chops it to the left of backward point who runs around and dives full length to keep Shoaib Malik on strike for the next over. Saqlain Haider is the fielder there
PAKISTAN:11.5 Fahad Tariq to U Akmal, no run, good length swerving in, in the corridor of uncertainty, not enough room for Akmal who looks to run it down to third man, beaten on the outside edge
PAKISTAN:11.4 Fahad Tariq to U Akmal, FOUR, that's a flat six, is it? Looks like it landed just on the boundary hoardings. The TV umpire is having a look and it clearly landed just inside the ropes. It was full, Akmal shimmies down the pitch and lifts his drive over the fielder at mid-off. No one in the deep and the onfield umpire had to check whether it was a six or a four
PAKISTAN:11.3 Fahad Tariq to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, fullish around fourth stump line, Malik push-drives in front of mid-on and hustles for a quick single
PAKISTAN:11.2 Fahad Tariq to U Akmal, 1 run, not much pace on offer and Akmal can only nudge it towards deep square leg
PAKISTAN:11.1 Fahad Tariq to U Akmal, 2 runs, 125ks, fraction full on off, Akmal shuffles and throws the kitchen sink at it. Went hard on the slog and it runs off the inside half towards deep backward squareFahad Tariq, comes into the attackSo, the equation now reads 79 from 54. This pair looks settled and UAE have to get some quick wickets if they are to create more jitters in the Pakistani dressing room...
PAKISTAN:10.6 Rohan Mustafa to Shoaib Malik, no run, darted down leg, Malik misses out on a freebie there. Goes for the glance but hits it straight to the fielder at short fine
PAKISTAN:10.5 Rohan Mustafa to Shoaib Malik, no run, good length on and around off, driven back to the bowler
PAKISTAN:10.4 Rohan Mustafa to U Akmal, 1 run, around middle and off, fullish in length, Akmal twirls his wrists on the flick, behind square leg for a single

PAKISTAN:10.1 Rohan Mustafa to U Akmal, no run, flat on middle, Akmal clips it to short fineRohan Mustafa, right-arm medium, comes into the attac
PAKISTAN:9.6 Shahzad to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, ah! After all those tight deliveries in the over, he caps off with a poor delivery. Down leg, Malik just had to get some bat on that. He does so with a flick and it races away to the fine leg fence
PAKISTAN:9.5 Shahzad to Shoaib Malik, no run, back of a length around off, Malik middles the punch but straight towards the fieldsman at backward point
PAKISTAN:9.4 Shahzad to Shoaib Malik, no run, very full at 134ks, just outside off and Malik lunges forward in defence

PAKISTAN:8.6 Ahmed Raza to U Akmal, 1 run, low full toss around off, Akmal drills it to long-on
PAKISTAN:8.5 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, flicked through mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:8.4 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, no run, loud appeal from the bowler but nothing from his colleagues. It was drifted in and went on with the angle, Malik was on the front foot trying to block. Missed and is rapped on the pad en route to the keeper. Might have been just outside the line of off and replays suggest the same
PAKISTAN:8.3 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, no run, nearly a return catch! Keeps it full and around off, Malik was a tad early into the drive and it tantalizingly fell short of the bowler
PAKISTAN:8.2 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, offers width and Malik pounces on it. Goes deep inside the crease and clobbers the cut behind backward point. Sweeper cover runs to his left and puts in a full length dive, but that wasn't good enough
PAKISTAN:8.1 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, no run, tossed up around off, defended back to the bowler
PAKISTAN:7.6 Shahzad to U Akmal, 2 runs, waits for this back of a length delivery and lat-cuts it down to third man for another brace
PAKISTAN:7.5 Shahzad to U Akmal, 2 runs, full again, Akmal moves around the crease and slots the flick wide of the fielder at mid-wicket, good enough for a couple of runs
PAKISTAN:7.4 Shahzad to U Akmal, no run, keeps it full and straight, Akmal flicks but cannot get it past mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:7.3 Shahzad to U Akmal, no run, that was a brilliant effort! Saqlain was the fielder there at point. Dives full length to his right and fields the ball one-handed. Was air-borne while doing so. It was a short of length delivery outside off and Akmal cracked the cut off the back foot and that effort nearly saved a boundary
PAKISTAN:7.2 Shahzad to U Akmal, no run, full and sprayed down leg, Akmal shuffles a tad and fails to flick. Hit on the pad in front of middle and leg but the angle might have taken it down leg. No real appeal
PAKISTAN:7.1 Shahzad to U Akmal, no run, good length, at 122ks around off, solidly punched towards mid-offMohammad Shahzad [1.0-0-1-0] is back into the attackUmar Akmal pulls off just when Shahzad was about to deliver...
PAKISTAN:6.6 Ahmed Raza to U Akmal, 1 run, somewhat flatter and Akmal drives it through mid-off for a single, retains the strike with that run
PAKISTAN:6.5 Ahmed Raza to U Akmal, no run, goes deep inside the crease to make up for the angle in and nudges it into the leg-side
PAKISTAN:6.4 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, this is Herath like but twice as slower. Tossed up wide of off, Malik eases it down to long-off
PAKISTAN:6.3 Ahmed Raza to U Akmal, 1 run, a touch dragged down but Pakistan have propelled themselves into a position where they can only get their bat high for a punchy single to long-on
PAKISTAN:6.2 Ahmed Raza to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, teasingly slow through the air. Drifts in on a very full length on middle. Worked to long-on again
PAKISTAN:6.1 Ahmed Raza to U Akmal, 1 run, flighted delivery outside off, Akmal gets taller to ride the bounce and punches it to long-onAhmed Raza, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack104 in 84 balls. Can't say this is achievable with certainty. Pakistan's recent batting history doesn't allow me to
PAKISTAN:5.6 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, no run, fullish and on off, skid into Malik who hurries into his flat-footed defence
PAKISTAN:5.5 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, no run, full and outside off, Malik shoulders arms
PAKISTAN:5.4 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, that was worth the wait. Overpitched, Malik nicely gets forward, flows into a drive through extra cover and gets his elbow to say hello to the heavens in his followthrough
PAKISTAN:5.3 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, 2 runs, length on middle, Malik twirls it round the corner and comes back for the second. Singles and braces will do
PAKISTAN:5.2 Amjad Javed to U Akmal, 1 run, this veered into the pads. Perhaps this was the intention last ball too. Akmal clips this one-legged, off the inside half and to backward square leg for a single
PAKISTAN:5.2 Amjad Javed to U Akmal, wide, not ideal. Splays this wide down leg, Akmal turns around trying to get some bat but it was just too wide
PAKISTAN:5.1 Amjad Javed to U Akmal, no run, very full outside off, Akmal creates some space and squeezes it out to mid-offAmjad will continue..
PAKISTAN:4.6 Shahzad to Shoaib Malik, no run, fullish and outside off, Malik stretches forward and defends it. 7 balls now and he is yet to get off the mark
PAKISTAN:4.5 Shahzad to Shoaib Malik, no run, off-pace and fuller on off, Malik eases it down in front of mid-on
PAKISTAN:4.4 Shahzad to U Akmal, 1 run, within the stumps, Akmal lets the ball arrive and turns it round the corner. A single, yes a single
PAKISTAN:4.3 Shahzad to U Akmal, no run, back of a length delivery, Akmal widens his stance to punch it square, gets it off the under-edge that thumps the pitch
PAKISTAN:4.2 Shahzad to U Akmal, no run, gets it to bounce a touch more and Akmal ends up splicing the ball towards mid-on. A run hinted at but aborted, could have been taken seeing the fielder's looping throw over the stumps at the bowler's end
PAKISTAN:4.1 Shahzad to U Akmal, no run, this is lovely. Test match ettiquettes in a T20. Pitched up and curling away, Akmal shoulders armsMohammad Shahzad, right-arm medium, comes into the attackTime for Mohammad Shahzad who's sporting a headband
PAKISTAN:3.6 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, no run, this is ripping stuff. Incredible. Frugal. Stunning. Gets this full ball to swing in from outside off, Malik reached out for the defence but the ball sneaked past the inside edge
PAKISTAN:3.5 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, no run, well, almost! Stay put Malik. Full ball dangled outside off, Malik lazily gets forward and pokes out at a drive. not to be. Beaten
PAKISTAN:3.4 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, no run, hurls this with a bit of shoulder, gets this length delivery to bound up and Malik gets his bat higher in his defence
PAKISTAN:3.3 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, no run, length ball outside off, Malik was late to bring his bat down but does well to hurry and keep this out
PAKISTAN:3.2 Amjad Javed to Shoaib Malik, no run, no forward defence can make up for these three wickets. Malik gets forward and graveyards this length ball near his bootShoaib Malik, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:3.1 Amjad Javed to Hafeez, out Caught by Fahad Tariq!! This is like taking a gun, shooting on your foot and jumping in pain. Gets a full delivery to drive, Hafeez does oblige with one but fails to keep it down. And off the toe-end too. Tariq at cover shuffles to his left and pouches it to invite wild celebrations. Amjad Javed had his arms wide while running and lets out puffs of air to highlight Pakistan's batting diffidence. Oh, the drama! Hafeez c Fahad Tariq b Amjad Javed 11(12) [4s-2]Amjad Javed to Hafeez, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:3.1 Amjad Javed to Hafeez, wide, fullish ball swinging past the tramline, a careful Hafeez lifts his bat and lets it goWhat has Javed for us this over? Hafeez on strike
PAKISTAN:2.6 Naveed to U Akmal, no run, length ball that stays a touch low. Very disciplined in the corridor of uncertainty, Akmal gets behind and blocks it with a low bat
PAKISTAN:2.5 Naveed to Hafeez, 1 run, just back of a length outside off, Hafeez stood taller and punched it to third man for a singleNaveed is hitting 140s in this over

PAKISTAN:2.2 Naveed to Hafeez, no run, very similar delivery. No room to swing a cut. Hafeez hops as he blunts it into the ground
PAKISTAN:2.1 Naveed to Hafeez, no run, absolutely cramps him for room with a length delivery on off, Hafeez slides deep to dig it into the pitchIn hindsight, what will this 2-wicket over mean?
PAKISTAN:1.6 Amjad Javed to U Akmal, no run, overpitched outside off, Akmal was behind it to thump it straight back to the bowler. Amjad Javed bent low to field or else that would have legged awayUmar Akmal, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:1.5 Amjad Javed to Manzoor, out Caught by Swapnil Patil!! Oh Pakistan! You started just as we feared. Manzoor had his soles glued to the pitch, just threw his bat at a back of a length delivery that zoomed off the pitch. Manages a feather and the keeper collects it to jump for joy. Manzoor c Swapnil Patil b Amjad Javed 0(2)Amjad Javed to Manzoor, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:1.4 Amjad Javed to Manzoor, no run, closes his bat face and defends this length ball towards mid-wicketKhurram Manzoor, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:1.3 Amjad Javed to Sharjeel Khan, out Lbw!! Such a late, late appeal that you cannot be faulted if you changed your idiot box's channel. Pitches this on a length on leg-stump and gets it to swing back in, hits Sharjeel Khan's right pad, above the kneeroll. Amjad Javed's appeal had almost waned off when the umpire decided to steal the thunder with a finger-hoisting. First down. That was missing the leg-stump, the HawkEye says. Sharjeel Khan lbw b Amjad Javed 4(3) [4s-1]Amjad Javed to Sharjeel Khan, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
PAKISTAN:1.2 Amjad Javed to Sharjeel Khan, FOUR, plonk your front leg across and club it through the covers. Gets a length ball, swings his bat and times the drive away to the fences

PAKISTAN:0.6 Naveed to Hafeez, FOUR, that's a beautiful way to cap the over. Naveed pitches it further up greedily, Hafeez bends low and eases the ball down the ground. Off she goes!
PAKISTAN:0.6 Naveed to Hafeez, wide, length hurled down leg, Hafeez misses his tickle
PAKISTAN:0.5 Naveed to Hafeez, no run, this is like Steyn but at a much slower pace. Gets this one to swing in, Hafeez looks to clip it through leg but a leading edge finds its way back to the bowler. Looks a bit tentative with the curl on offer
PAKISTAN:0.4 Naveed to Hafeez, no run, pitches this full outside off and hits the bat hard. Hafeez jabs the defence back down the pitch
PAKISTAN:0.3 Naveed to Hafeez, 2 runs, this threatened to come in. Hafeez hurriedly clips it off his pads, gets his inside edge in action and gets a brace to fine leg
PAKISTAN:0.2 Naveed to Hafeez, no run, good swing on this one too. Full, in the channel and moving away to see Hafeez shoulder armsOne slip
PAKISTAN:0.1 Naveed to Hafeez, no run, pitches it on a fullish length and gets it to curl away, Hafeez lifts his bat and lets it goHafeez and Sharjeel Khan are at the crease. Hafeez is on strike. Naveed will open the attackThe UAE huddle features a lot of smiles. The players walk out now in front of a sprinkling of a crowd. Very determined Hafeez and Sharjeel jog their way to the middle..Naveed has the new ball. The talking countdown is on...here we go!Pakistan mimick a nerd - give them a book (read: ball) and they'll ace it all, give them a microphone (read: bat) and they just might fumble. UAE have 46 more runs than Pakistan could manage against India the other day. To put it bluntly, there's hope. Expect plenty of events, like at your cousin's marriage, because Pakistan are chasing a total. That often makes for an implosion of a much, much higher degree.After being stunted to 12/3 early on, UAE will take this. Rather they'll grab this with both hands. Former Pakistan player and current UAE coach Aaqib Javed would have been happy with a 100 before this game, his batsmen have given him 29 more. Shaiman Anwar's steady knock in the middle ensured that the innings didn't fall away after the early jolts. Then some decent swipes in the slog overs from the troika of Usman, Javed and Naveed has ensured that the Pakistani dressing room will be slightly twitchy. Amir was brilliant again with the ball, despite not generating the swing which he did against India. Excellent figures of 4-1-6-2. The rest of the bowling was decent if not sizzling. Do we have a match on? We just might. Let's see..1
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.6 Sami to Naveed, no run, UAE overwhemingly crawl to 129. The umpire had a chat with Amjad Javed about the wide but it all ends with a dot. Full and wide of off, Naveed squats with an extended arm to flay it through point, doesn't connect. This last ball largely summarizes UAE's struggles to spot the bat's middleWas it a wide?
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.5 Sami to Naveed, no run, this looked like an ugly desperate uppish drive over cover. Only that Naveed cannot connect it
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.4 Sami to Naveed, no run, that's out of the coaching manual except that you have to connect. Got low and looked to boom it over cover. Full and a bit of curl away to beat him
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.3 Sami to Naveed, FOUR, would you believe? A high full toss and but for the outside edge, it could have gone unpunished. Naveed looks to flay it through covers, not behind the line and the edge runs away to third man
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.2 Sami to Naveed, SIX, that had more height than width. Like Irfan. Short ball on the stumps, Naveed fetched it with a pull. Can't say he timed it off the middle because the ball looked like dipping anytime inside the deep mid-wicket fence. Not to be
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.1 Sami to Amjad Javed, 1 run, full ball outside off, the batsman protracts his arms to squeeze it out and does so behind square on the off-sideMohammad Sami [3.0-0-17-1] is back into the attackMohammad Naveed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.6 Amir to Muhammad Usman, out Bowled!! This had to happen. Sometime. Like Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar win. Usman had made room like always, Amir fires in a yorker at his left boot. The ball hurts him and ends his misery by ricocheting onto the stumps. Good cameo this nonetheless. Muhammad Usman b Amir 21(17) [4s-2 6s-1]Amir to Muhammad Usman, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.5 Amir to Muhammad Usman, no run, and another. Follow the batsman with a length delivery and at times befuddle him with a slower delivery, like this time
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.4 Amir to Muhammad Usman, no run, this is a crease-bound dance. Makes room and just swings his bat for an aim over mid-on. The ball zooms over leg-stump and goes past the blindfolded but aggressive shot
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.3 Amir to Muhammad Usman, FOUR, and this wide yorker from over the wicket has been shown the ropes. Slid deeper, slices it over a leaping point and gets another boundary
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.2 Amir to Muhammad Usman, no run, near yorker length outside off, Usman hunches to steer it down to third man but it's too quick. And too wide to be doing that
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.1 Amir to Muhammad Usman, no run, Amir is too clever. Sees the batsman making room, follows him with a shortish delivery that cuts him into two. In between his torso and the wildly swinging blade
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.6 Irfan to Amjad Javed, no run, anything full is just being missed out in the death overs. Outside off this time, Javed leaves this alone
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.5 Irfan to Amjad Javed, SIX, that as neat as your Wednesday whites. Or the mathematics paper of a backbencher. Clears his front leg, makes room further and tonks it over long-off. Just kept sailing over!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.4 Irfan to Amjad Javed, no run, length ball with extra bounce, Javed swiveled inside his crease and just didn't connect
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.3 Irfan to Amjad Javed, no run, full and moving away outside off, Javed throws his bat but couldn't reach out
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.2 Irfan to Amjad Javed, SIX, wait, what? this was the I-am-trying-to-hide pull. Gets a short ball following him, ducks but then thinks that he has to lay bat on that. Crosses his bat, gets a top-edge that goes all the way over fine leg. Oh, the wood explosion in the bat these days!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.1 Irfan to Muhammad Usman, 1 run, haha. That was funny. Played like Nadal but with the grace of me dancing. Flat-batted to long-on and the throw was straight to Irfan who was over the stumps to collect that - with his legs wide like a compass, as if ridiculing the stumps. the ball was right in the pocket between his thighs and gateways its way through. There's your next script for a comedy OscarMohammad Irfan [3.0-0-17-2] is back into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.6 Amir to Amjad Javed, no run, routine this is. Another play-and-a-miss. Makes room, like everytime, and flashes his horizontal bat at this. Ball nips away a touch and waterjugs all his intent
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.5 Amir to Amjad Javed, no run, gets this on a length wide of off, Javed made room to cut but missed out. Lovely bowling this. Have this for your dessert
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.4 Amir to Amjad Javed, no run, this is fiery stuff, as Rameez Raja would say. Goes for the pull but the ball is too quick. Gets through his pull and to the keeper
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.3 Amir to Amjad Javed, no run, follows Javed up with a bouncer. Javed was late, still went with it, gets a top-edge onto the helmet which lobs just in front of the wicket. Wide of an on-rushing Amir and a stationed keeper
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.2 Amir to Muhammad Usman, 1 run, Usman was backing away and Amir aims the middle-stump dartboard. Usman gets his bat down in a hurry and squeezes it out off the inside edge through square leg
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.1 Amir to Muhammad Usman, no run, bends his back right up, gets it to bound off the pitch and Usman sways away in sanity. Was a touch wide to be fairMohammad Amir [2.0-1-1-1] is back into the attackAmir's here!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.6 Sami to Amjad Javed, no run, another one past the blade. The outside edge must feel like being stalked tonight. Full and curling away outside off, Javed gets across and aims to drive. Nowhere close and is beaten
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.5 Sami to Amjad Javed, no run, pitched up and moving away outside off, betas Javed's room-making plan. Swings away and makes him look a touch silly
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.4 Sami to Amjad Javed, FOUR, arrogant stuff to follow that. Fetch that bowler! Backs away, gets his bat high and thwarts it over mid-off, one bounce over the ropes
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.3 Sami to Muhammad Usman, 1 run, gets it to rip up from back of a length, Usman takes his bottom hand off and fends it into the leg-side off the glove. Gets it away enough for a single to be effected
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.2 Sami to Amjad Javed, 1 run, another ambitious cross-batted shot that ekes out a top-edge. Falls short of an on-rushing long-on and it's a single
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.1 Sami to Amjad Javed, FOUR, everything's quick for a fast bowler. Javed wanted to tonk it across the line. Gets blindfolded and swings, ekes out a top-edge that beats Irfan's jog from third manMohammad Sami [2.0-0-7-1] is back into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.6 Shoaib Malik to Muhammad Usman, FOUR, gets some width. This is ordinary. Plays it late and cuts it past backward point for a deft one to follow a I-punish-you maximum
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.5 Shoaib Malik to Muhammad Usman, SIX, dragged down to the horror that Usman could stand tall, swivel and pummel the mediocrity on that with a pull over backward square leg. Just over, I should say. Nawaz leapt but it went over
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.4 Shoaib Malik to Muhammad Usman, no run, tossed up on leg-stump, extra bounce as Usman look to work it into the leg-side, zooms up and Usman shies his head away
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.3 Shoaib Malik to Muhammad Usman, 2 runs, hint of width and Usman pounces with a flash. Good fielding from the sweeper who runs across and cuts it off
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.2 Shoaib Malik to Amjad Javed, 1 run, that hung in the air for a while, the batsman waits for it to arrive and then clipped it to deep mid-wicket
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.1 Shoaib Malik to Muhammad Usman, leg byes, 1 run, fired down leg from round the wicket, Usman misses the clip and the ball pads awayShoaib Malik, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.6 Irfan to Amjad Javed, FOUR, top-edge and over the keeper. Irfan digs it on a length and Javed aims for a mighty heave over mid-wicket, the edge flies over the keeper and dribbles away to the third man fence
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.5 Irfan to Amjad Javed, no run, backs away and looks to pull a short ball, missesAmjad Javed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.4 Irfan to Shaiman Anwar, out Caught by Sarfraz!! And Irfan gets his man. Yet again it's that extra bounce that does the trick for him. Sees the batsman making room and keeps it on a short of a length and angles it away from the batsman. Anwar was in no position to lay bat on that, pokes it at it tamely and nicks it to the keeper. Shaiman Anwar c Sarfraz b Irfan 46(42) [4s-5 6s-2]Irfan to Shaiman Anwar, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.3 Irfan to Shaiman Anwar, 2 runs, goes for a full-blooded pull this time, was beaten by the pace and extra bounce on the delivery. Hits him high on the bat but it lands between an incoming long-on and a backtracking mid-wicket, Anwar got lucky there
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.2 Irfan to Shaiman Anwar, no run, looks to pull a shortish delivery on the stumps, fails to make any connection as he was beaten by the pace
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.1 Irfan to Shaiman Anwar, no run, short ball outside off, Anwar backs away and looks to ramp, beaten by the extra bounceMohammad Irfan [2.0-0-11-1] is back into the attack

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:12.5 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, 2 runs, wide of off, Anwar cuts to the right of point who gets a hand but couldn't prevent the double
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:12.4 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, FOUR, another one that'a a little too straight from Afridi and Anwar goes for the lap sweep and helps it over the fielder inside the ring at short fine, third consecutive boundary and Afridi is seen shaking his head, he is not a happy chappie
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:12.3 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, FOUR, well! Anwar has decided to take the aerial route. Makes room and gets to the pitch of the delivery, it was a tossed up delivery and Anwar made good connection. Lofts it off the bottom of the bat but gets it in the gap at deep cover, no chance for the fielder in the deep
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:12.2 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, FOUR, right through the legs of Umar Akmal at backward point. Fired full and wide, Anwar slices the drive and it nutmegs a lazy Umar Akmal, through his legs and into the fence
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:12.1 Afridi to Muhammad Usman, 1 run, too straight and Usman works it through mid-wicket
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:12.1 Afridi to Muhammad Usman, wide, full toss down leg, Usman fails to connect
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:11.6 Mohammad Nawaz to Shaiman Anwar, no run, again, goes hard on the punch and could only get it towards cover-point

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:11.1 Mohammad Nawaz to Shaiman Anwar, SIX, aggression from Shaiman Anwar, goes for the slog sweep and makes good connection, straight into the mid-wicket standsMuhammad Usman, left handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.6 Afridi to Usman Mushtaq, out Caught by Mohammad Nawaz!! Soft dismissal. Mushtaq sinks to one knee and aims a sweep over short fine. The ball is full down leg and Mushtaq got only get a top edge on that. A dolly to Nawaz at short fine. Usman Mushtaq c Mohammad Nawaz b Afridi 9(19) [4s-1]Afridi to Usman Mushtaq, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.5 Afridi to Usman Mushtaq, no run, stifled appeal for lbw but that was going down leg, the wrong' un around middle, beat Mushtaq on the forward defence. He was hit in line with middle and leg, but would have missed the leg peg.
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.4 Afridi to Usman Mushtaq, no run, makes room looking to cut one through cover, toe-ends it to the fielder
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.3 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, flicked down to fine leg
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.2 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, no run, quicker and just outside off, not much of turn. Anwar has a big whoosh after making room, could only connect with thin air. Sarfraz was taken aback by the pace on the delivery, just manages to get his head away but the ball did hit him on the chest. He looks fine though
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.1 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, no run, the googly again, Anwar makes room and goes hard on the punch, straight to cove

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:8.5 Afridi to Usman Mushtaq, 1 run, flicked behind square leg
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:8.5 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, 2 wides, this time Afridi overcorrects and drifts it down the leg-stump line, Anwar fails to flick. The ball rolls off the pad and towards backward square, should have been leg byes but the umpire doesn't think so
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:8.4 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, no run, the legspinner from BOOM-BOOM and Shaiman Anwar is beaten all ends up, looks to play down the wrong line and it just grazes the outside, missed by a whisker. Pitched around off and spun past the edge
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:8.3 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, no run, the googly from Afridi, Anwar makes room and looks to cut, is cramped for room and ends up chopping it into the off-side
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:8.2 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, no run, makes room and looks to to go big, but the ball stops and he ends up pushing it to cover

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:7.5 Mohammad Nawaz to Shaiman Anwar, SIX, just over a leaping fielder at long-off. Good, calculated risk from Shaiman Anwar, makes room and goes for an inside out drive. Connected it well and that had enough power to carry over the ropes. Malik backtracks and leaps but to no avail
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:7.5 Mohammad Nawaz to Shaiman Anwar, wide, drifts this down leg, Anwar aims to sweep and misses
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:7.4 Mohammad Nawaz to Usman Mushtaq, 1 run, drags his length back around off, Mushtaq mistimes the punch to the right of a diving bowler and gets across for a single

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:7.1 Mohammad Nawaz to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, comes in with the arm, around middle, Anwar tucks towards mid-wicket and nabs an easy single, the bowler wanders around to fieldMohammad Nawaz, comes into the attackRight then, here comes the debutant. No slips in place...
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:6.6 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, a little more air draws Anwar forward as he pushes it with the turn to long-off
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:6.5 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, no run, hesitantly forward to a quicker one and blocks
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:6.4 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, no run, sliding on with the arm towards middle, chopped onto pad off a thick inside edge
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:6.3 Afridi to Usman Mushtaq, 1 run, that's a rank half-tracker wide of off, but Mushtaq is so tentative that he has under-edged the cut, right between the keeper's legs and wide of short fine leg
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:6.2 Afridi to Usman Mushtaq, no run, oooh, Mushtaq is utterly deceived by the flatter trajectory here. Played back to a full ball skidding towards middle, manages to get the bat down straight and keep it out
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:6.1 Afridi to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, flatter and short enough to be rocking on the back foot and slapping it to deep coverShahid Afridi, right-arm leg break, comes into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:5.6 Irfan to Usman Mushtaq, no run, length ball angling away outside off, no shot offered
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:5.5 Irfan to Usman Mushtaq, FOUR, that's soared off the bat-shoulder and looped up over Hafeez at slip. Such an awkward customer, this Irfan. Slips in a short of length delivery from the first floor, gets it to rise steeply around Mushtaq's shoulder as he hops to fend it off. Lucky boundary
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:5.4 Irfan to Usman Mushtaq, no run, on a good length on off, defended into the off-side
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:5.3 Irfan to Usman Mushtaq, no run, digs in a short of length off-cutter, and gets it to kick off the pitch, also grips and jags away just outside off, enough to beat the outside edge as Mushtaq hopped to fend it off
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:5.2 Irfan to Usman Mushtaq, no run, nah, need to get it further full outside off, this one is on a length and doesn't tempt Mushtaq into driving
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:5.1 Irfan to Usman Mushtaq, no run, watch out here. Watch out for the one full and wide. This one pushed Mushtaq back in the crease. Surely setting him up
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.6 Sami to Shaiman Anwar, no run, clipped neatly off the hips to square leg. A wicketless over
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.5 Sami to Shaiman Anwar, no run, pulls the length back further just outside off, makes Anwar hop to keep it down
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.4 Sami to Shaiman Anwar, no run, these UAE batsmen are being caught on the crease far too often. Just pats a back of a length delivery towards backward point without really pulling his weight on the back foot
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.3 Sami to Shaiman Anwar, no run, holds its line from a back of a length outside off, left alone
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.2 Sami to Shaiman Anwar, no run, length ball around off, forward and defended
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.1 Sami to Shaiman Anwar, FOUR, some relief. Full and down the leg-side, Anwar helps himself to a boundary with a tickle fine of fine legMohammad Sami [1.0-0-3-1] is back into the attackUsman Mushtaq, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.6 Irfan to Shahzad, out Caught by Sarfraz!! Irfan has struck with a beauty and UAE are now tottering at 12/3. Can't find much fault with this one. Most of the top-order would have nicked off to that. Disconcerting bounce from a short of length and leaving the batsman with the angle, but close enough to off to compel a stroke. Shahzad is squared up on the back foot and the edge is found. Shahzad c Sarfraz b Irfan 5(3) [4s-1]Irfan to Shahzad, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.6 Irfan to Shahzad, wide, down the leg-side and past Shahzad before he could get his bat across on the glance
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.5 Irfan to Shahzad, FOUR, ufff, that's a good shot. Moment he saw the length being a fraction full outside off, out came a big forward stride and then the upper body leant wonderfully into the drive through the covers
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.4 Irfan to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, slips in a short of length delivery, rises around Anwar's throat and hurries him up on the pull, mistimes it wide of mid-on
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.3 Irfan to Shaiman Anwar, no run, cuts back in from a back of a length on off, and thuds on the thigh pad after cramping him for room
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.2 Irfan to Shaiman Anwar, no run, that's a very loose stroke. Length ball leaving him outside off, Anwar doesn't bother moving his front foot across to cover the line and tries to lash it through the covers, the extra bounce beats the edge
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.1 Irfan to Shahzad, 1 run, fullish from Irfan around off, but then the length is relative when he is bowling. Shahzad is tempted to get forward but he still can't get to the pitch due to the almost vertical bounce, gets a thick inside edge on the drive and pinches a single wide of mid-wicketMohammad Irfan, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.6 Amir to Shaiman Anwar, no run, closer to off on a good length, blocked into the off-side
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.5 Amir to Shaiman Anwar, no run, back to over the wicket and back to angling it away outside off, the length is not full enough and Anwar's waft connects nothingShaiman Anwar, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.4 Amir to Muhammad Kaleem, out Bowled!! These are danger signs for UAE. Their second opener has gone back to a ball which isn't all that menacing. Slanted in from round the wicket, aiming for the top of off, and it hits the top of off. The batsman is merely a spectator. Don't know what he was trying to do. His feet were chained, the bat came down very late as he tried to angle it through the off-side, and that's the end of that. Muhammad Kaleem b Amir 1(11)Amir to Muhammad Kaleem, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.3 Amir to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, angled in on off, Kaleem stays rooted and blocksAmir senses he isn't getting much in the air, and moves over to round the wicket..
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.2 Amir to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, off-cutter on a good length on off, Kaleem moves inches forward and defends into the off-side
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.1 Amir to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, length ball which goes on with the arm outside off, left aloneMohammad Shahzad, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.6 Sami to Rohan Mustafa, out Caught by Afridi!! What a dismal effort. Charges out to Sami so early, allows him to shorten the length, and rather than admitting defeat, he goes through with a heave. Gets it high on the bat and spoons it to Afridi at mid-off. Rohan Mustafa c Afridi b Sami 1(5)Sami to Rohan Mustafa, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.6 Sami to Rohan Mustafa, wide, wild delivery, way way down leg, Mustafa can't reach it despite his best efforts
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.5 Sami to Rohan Mustafa, no run, Mustafa wants a big piece of Sami here. Clears his front leg looking to open up the off-side, but is cramped for room slightly, ends up chopping the short of length delivery to cover
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.4 Sami to Muhammad Kaleem, 1 run, swinging away from a back of a length outside off, Kaleem chases it with his hands away from the body, and dabs it between slips and gully down to third man
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.3 Sami to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, skiddy from a back of a length on off, half-forward to knock it in front of cover
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.2 Sami to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, short of length delivery outside off, patted to point
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.2 Sami to Muhammad Kaleem, wide, loses the wrist completely and falls away down the leg-side, Kaleem lets it pass
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.1 Sami to Rohan Mustafa, leg byes, 1 run, hits the deck on a back of a length and nips in slightly in line with leg to miss the bat of Mustafa's attempted flick. A muffled appeal for LBW but there is nothing going for it. They collect a leg-bye wide of mid-wicketMohammad Sami, right-arm fast, comes into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.6 Amir to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, that's the over done with another leave outside off. Steady from Amir if not flamboyant
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.5 Amir to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, an inkling of swing back in but it's well wide of off and let through to the keeper
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.4 Amir to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, fuller this time and leaving Kaleem, he can't resist the drive this time and flashes hard without much feet, no way he could cover the angle and is beaten
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.3 Amir to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, pushed across with the angle on a length, left alone
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.2 Amir to Rohan Mustafa, 1 run, slanted in on middle on a fuller length, Mustafa nudges it to the right of mid-on and sets off. Could have been tight had the fielder been just a touch quicker in releasing the ball after sliding to stop
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.1 Amir to Rohan Mustafa, no run, there's that shape straightaway, moving away from the leftie from over the wicket, only that the line isn't close enough to draw a strokeRohan Mustafa and Muhammad Kaleem are at the crease. Rohan Mustafa is on strike. Amir will open the attackThere is a very sparse crowd in at the Shere Bangla. Don't suppose many expect UAE to be box-office. Out come Rohan Mustafa and Muhammad Kaleem to prove them wrong. Afridi is standing right beside Kaleem at the non-striker's end giving him a pat on the back as we begin the countdown. Two slips for Amir as he runs in..Teams:United Arab Emirates (Playing XI): Rohan Mustafa, Muhammad Kaleem, Mohammad Shahzad, Shaiman Anwar, Swapnil Patil(w), Muhammad Usman, Amjad Javed(c), Fahad Tariq, Usman Mushtaq, Ahmed Raza, Mohammad NaveedPakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Sharjeel Khan, Khurram Manzoor, Umar Akmal, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi(c), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Sami, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad IrfanAfridi: "Don't want to repeat the performance from the last game. Seniors need to take responsibility in the batting. Not taking much pressure, can't underestimate UAE. Wahab Riaz is resting and Nawaz is given a game."Javed: "We'll bat first. Last couple of games we went the other way round and couldn't make it, so let's see what happens. Would be a good experience for our side. We'll play our normal game and hopefully we can get around 120-130 and the bowlers will back us. Need our batsmen to step up on the big stage. One change in the form of Usman Mushtaq who steps in for Saqlain Haider."United Arab Emirates have won the toss and have opted to bat"As we are progressing, they are starting to shave the grass off the pitches. The curators haven't had the time to water them much as usually happens in a T20 tourney. It makes for batsmen having to think offering a bit for the pacers and spinners. Think it's a 150 pitch," sums up Dean Jones in the pitch report.Don't discount the fact that UAE have fought all the way to be here. They scraped through a qualifying phase in which Afghanistan were primed to emerge victorious. But UAE weren't there to make up the numbers. In the very first match of those qualifiers itself, they beat Afghanistan to send out a message and then went on to win everything. No one can question their place here. Now to go one step ahead and make a massive impression. The toss isn't far away. Stay with us..There isn't much delight in defeat. Ask anyone going around. No matter how well you bowled, how badly you fought, how you never gave up, nothing matters. But there was something about Pakistan's loss to India the other night. Something which got the world talking. An emotion which can only be aroused by a fast bowler. The prodigy, the disgraced, the redeemed - Mohammad Amir. If you saw it, and your jaws didn't separate with awe, this sport isn't for you. Will we see another special from the Wasim Akram heir-in-waiting? I would shudder at that thought if I was a UAE batsman.18:30 Local Time, 12:30 GMT, 18:00 IST: Welcome all to another evening of the Asia Cup. Tonight will see Pakistan take on the supposed 'whipping boys' of the tournament in UAE, their first encounter in the T20 format. There is a sense of overwhelming formality about this one. Pakistan will take the field, their pacers will fire, and they will brush aside UAE's challenge easily and notch up their first win on the board. Simple. But then today is the day when Leonardo DiCaprio won an Oscar. Don't think stars have been aligned better in over 1000 years for odds-bucking. Only that UAE's batsmen haven't offered much in their previous two encounters to inspire that sort of hope. Preview by Ganesh Chandrasekaran: While there is no doubting that Pakistan start the game as clear favourites, they will do well not to err on the side of complacency against the Unites Arab Emirates, on Monday (February 29). Both teams are yet to register a win in the Asia Cup. UAE have lost both their games so far - against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh - while Pakistan were overcome by India. This game presents Pakistan with an ideal chance to get some momentum going before facing tougher challenges. For UAE, the motto has been to try and win games. They will take a lot of heart from their bowling efforts in their previous two games. Their bowlers will take credit for keeping them in the game right until the halfway mark in both games. But the batting department as failed to match up to the same standards.Skipper Amjad Javed expressed similar concerns after the first game and hoped that his batsmen will stand up and be noticed as much as the bowlers but so far it hasn't borne fruit. They will not have it any easier against Pakistan's strong bowling attack which, led by a splendid Mohammad Amir, managed to rattle a very strong Indian batting line-up even whilst defending just 83.For both teams, the conditions prevalent at the Shere Bangla Stadium in Dhaka will be a cause of concern. While the first four games saw the pacers coming into the limelight, the fifth game saw the grass being shaven off the pitch. It resulted in the spinners to having a say while a batsman like Sabbir Rahman could get himself in and score a fluent 80. The conditions will no doubt have a huge say in the team selections as well. If Pakistan find the track to be a little drier, they might not go in with four seamers as they did against India. One of Wahab Riaz or Mohammad Irfan might well be cut loose and a spinner included in his place.For UAE, the first eleven is likely to be persisted with. They might not have the luxury of choosing a better eleven than the one that played against Bangladesh. They have their bases covered though in terms of options for both spin and pace alike. Their focus will squarely lie upon improving shot-selection and adapting to a little more conservative approach if the conditions so demand.Pakistan will prefer to test out their spin options as well ahead of the ICC World Twenty20 and will perhaps be hoping for a drier pitch to aid their cause. Given the nature of collapse against India, the batting unit have only upwards to go. They will consider this as a fresh start and will probably give the same set of players another go to redeem themselves.A lot of focus will also come upon Amir who has quickly grown into their lead strike bowler in his second-coming. Under lights and with a bit of moisture around in the evenings, his swing becomes even more potent. It is his opening spell that UAE will be preparing hard to tackle.For Pakistan it will help that they play this opponent soon after their game against India. They had been in UAE for the Pakistan Super League before coming in straight to a high-pressure game such as the one against India. This might indeed be their chance to start afresh and look at their right options and combinations. The batting unit too will take some time to get used to the conditions which have, so far, been quite alien to the traditional sub-continental pitches.Given that there will be lesser pressure on them, the batsmen will probably fancy a far more relaxed outing to get into their groove.They cannot afford to be too laid back though. As UAE have shown, their bowlers are a force to reckon with if the conditions do assist them. For Javed's team there will be nothing close in comparison to the joy of pulling off an upset. Rarely do they get a chance to play against the Test playing nations. Given the present scenario they will probably have to wait a little longer to experience such quality opposition in quick succession. They have two more chances to make a mark for themselves. Pakistan are up first. There is no doubt that the players will be giving it their all, and then some more.Teams:United Arab Emirates (From): Muhammad Kaleem, Rohan Mustafa, Mohammad Shahzad, Shaiman Anwar, Swapnil Patil(w), Muhammad Usman, Amjad Javed(c), Mohammad Naveed, Ahmed Raza, Saqlain Haider, Qadeer Ahmed, Fahad Tariq, Farhan Ahmed, Zaheer Maqsood, Usman MushtaqPakistan (From): Sharjeel Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Khurram Manzoor, Shoaib Malik, Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi(c), Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Sami, Mohammad Irfan, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Nawaz, Khalid Latif, Anwar AliLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
