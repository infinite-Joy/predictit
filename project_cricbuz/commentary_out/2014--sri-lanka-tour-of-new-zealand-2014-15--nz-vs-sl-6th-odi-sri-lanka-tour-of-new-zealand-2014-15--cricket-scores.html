Another poor decision from umpire GoughMJ has been given out LBW, he went for the review straightaway. Vettori is fine with the no-ball. Did he get an inside edge? The initial reaction from Mahela is that he got some wood on that. The HotSpot shows a mark on the bat. He is going to survive once again. The decision has been overruled.

SRI LANKA:15.5 Vettori to M Jayawardene, no run, the arm-ball from the wily Vettori, Jayawardene presses forward and ekes out an inside edge onto the pad, the ball deflects off the pad and pops towards slip. Taylor dives in front and collects the ball, but there was no conclusive evidence to rule MJ out. So, the decision was overturned as the on-field umpire had given it outThe umpire is referring a catch to the TV umpire. The on-field umpire gave it out, but Taylor was not sure. Hence he sent it upstairs. It is a legal delivery, no issues with Vettori's front foot. There is an inside edge, so no problems with that. But did Taylor get his fingers underneath the ball? The third umpire is having a long look. He has also asked for the zoomer. Remember that earlier in the game, Guptill was not given out in the same situation. Not Out!

Thirimanne is on strike. Mills will open the attackWelcome back... Thirimanne and Dilshan are in the middle, Thirimanne will on strike. Kyle Mills opens the attack for New Zealand with two slips in place..Hearth was the pick of the bowlers, he finished with 1/45 in his 10 overs. Lakmal was excellent at the start and Dhammika got it right at the end. Thisara Perera had a forgettable day with the ball as he conceded 86 runs in his 10 overs. It is now upto the Sri Lankan batsmen to chase down this total and stay alive in the series. Join us back in a short while for the run-chase....Taylor joined Williamson in the middle and put on a magnificent 117-run stand for the 3rd wicket, Williamson continued his golden run in ODIs as he registered his 14th fifty, before he was sold down the river by Taylor for 97. Nonetheless, Taylor took on the anchor's role and stitched a nice little partnership of 78 runs with Anderson, but he too fell short of his hundred and gave Sri Lankan an opportunity to come back into the game.Sri Lanka have done well today to claw their way back into this game by taking some late wickets. However, the New Zealand batsmen have once again risen up to the ocassion and have amassed a big total on the board. Lakmal and Dhammika started off well, troubling both McCullum and Guptill. The former perished early, Guptill and Williamson then put on a 59-run stand before Perera dismissed Guptill, who had a series of lucky decisions going his way.4

Lakmal will start the proceedings for Sri Lanka with two slips in place...Sri Lanka have also made two changes to their side. Senanayake and Kulasekara make way for Herath and Prasad.As per New Zealand's rotation policy, Nathan McCullum and Tim Southee sit out for this game. Daniel Vettori and Kyle Mills are back into the playing XI. With his inclusion Daniel Vettori, becomes the most capped ODI player for New Zealand with 280 caps to his name.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Lahiru Thirimanne(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Dhammika Prasad, Rangana Herath, Suranga LakmalNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent BoultNew Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batIt is a do-or-die game for the visitors. With New Zealand leading the series 3-1 and two games remaining, Sri Lanka have to win to stay alive in the series. Will they make any changes to the side that played the in last match? Will New Zealand test out their bench strength? Hello and welcome to the sixth ODI at Dunedin. Stay tuned as toss and teams are coming up in a short while....Sri Lanka were poor with the ball, that is putting it mildly. There were too many full tosses and long hops dished out during the latter half of the game. They duly missed Mathews, who is nursing a calf injury and will not be available for today's game as well. Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a valiant hundred, but none of the other batters contributed. They lost their last 8 wickets for just 41 runs.In the previous game, Luke Ronchi and Grant Elliott got New Zealand back into the game from a difficult situation. The hosts were struggling at 93/5 before the duo put on a record 267-run stand for the sixth wicket. Both batsmen got to their respective hundreds, with Ronchi going berserk at the end. The wicket-keeper went onto make 170, the most runs scored by a No. 7 batsman. Elliott, on the other end, silenced his critics who were not happy with his inclusion in the World Cup squad with an all-round show.PreviewBefore the start of the ODI series, there was a perception that New Zealand relied too heavily on Kane Williamson and Brendon McCullum for their success. There were some weak points in the team which made their ODI set-up a little shaky. After five matches in the series against Sri Lanka, the hosts are leading 3-1 and they are ironing out their weak points ahead of the World Cup.The big gains in the last two matches have been Luke Ronchi and Grant Elliott. New Zealand's wicketkeeper helped them close out a thriller at Nelson thanks to his 15-ball 32 and a couple of days later, he repeated his heroics in a spectacular fashion in Dunedin. His unbeaten 170 was the third-highest score by a wicketkeeper and the highest by a No 7 batsman.On the other hand, Elliott has also redeemed himself after being sidelined in the New Zealand team for close to a year. His crucial 88-run stand with Williamson in Nelson and his world record 267-run stand with Ronchi at Dunedin have established him as the batsman who can drag the team out of a tough situation. Slowly, New Zealand are assuming a feeling of completeness in both bowling and batting.Sri Lanka, on the other hand, are crumbling in all departments. The team is still heavily reliant on Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan for big scores while it is missing the experience of Lasith Malinga. Sri Lanka haven't been helped by the absence of Angelo Mathews, who will be absent for the sixth ODI as well due to a calf strain. With the bowlers going for plenty in the fifth ODI, there might be some changes to the bowling department.New ZealandThe batting looks in great condition but the top order will be aiming to avoid a repeat of their Friday collapse, when they were in trouble at 93 for five. Martin Guptill still continues to blow hot and cold while Ross Taylor will be desperate to change his luck, having scored just one fifty in the last eight innings and averaging just over 30. The only changes in the team might be in the bowling and it could be in the spin department. Nathan McCullum did not bowl his full quota of overs and this might tempt the team management to play Daniel Vettori in the next match.Probable XI1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (c), 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Grant Elliott, 6 Corey Anderson, 7 Luke Ronchi (wk), 8 Nathan McCullum/Daniel Vettori, 9 Tim Southee, 10 Mitchell McClenaghan, 11 Trent BoultSri LankaWith Mathews missing out, Lahiru Thirimanne will again captain the team. Sri Lanka will probably include Rangana Herath in order to contain New Zealand's aggression. All the bowlers took some stick on Friday, particularly Suranga Lakmal, who went for 93 in his 10 overs, could be excluded from the team on Sunday.Probable XI1 Lahiru Thirimanne (c), 2 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Dimuth Karunaratne, 6 Dinesh Chandimal, 7 Thisara Perera, 8 Jeevan Mendis, 9 Rangana Herath, 10 Nuwan Kulasekara, 11 Suranga Lakmal/Dhammika PrasadTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Lahiru Thirimanne(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Sachithra Senanayake, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Rangana Herath, Shaminda Eranga, Dhammika Prasad, Lasith Malinga, Angelo MathewsNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent Boult, Kyle Mills, Adam Milne, Tom Latham, Daniel Vettori, Matt HenryLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
