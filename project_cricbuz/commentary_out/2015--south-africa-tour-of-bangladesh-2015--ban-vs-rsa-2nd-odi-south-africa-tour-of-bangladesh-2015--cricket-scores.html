Only time will tell. Abbott will open the proceedings with the ball. Tamim is on strike. There are two slips in placeFor the hosts, Rubel Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman bowled tidily and were rewarded with five wickets between them. Rubel, in particular, attacked the stumps on a track that kept low and that resulted in him taking wickets. His pace colleague, Mustafizur, again used off-cutters to good effect. The spinners too kept it tight and supported the seamers well. In fact, this is only the second time that Bangladesh have bowled out South Africa in ODIs. It may turn out to be a slightly tricky chase as the track is offering help for the bowlers.Bangladesh's bowlers put up a fine all-round show to skittle out the visitors for a modest total. On a deck where the ball stopped on the batsmen, the opposition ranks were completely out of their depth. Among their key batsmen, only Faf du Plessis showed good defence and played late to keep the scorecard ticking. Later on in the innings, Behardien gave a good account of himself to give the score some respectability. 4

It is always good to bat first in these situations. There are no changes in the team.'Pitch Report: 'There is a bit of a green tinge. Probably dead grass and light grass rolled in. There might be some extra bounce for the seamers. The pitch looks really hard. The batsmen will feel comfortable it they get set on this pitch,' reckons Athar Ali KhanTeams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Mustafizur RahmanSouth Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla(c), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Imran TahirSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to batSo, Bangladesh's batsmen need to show more application while facing up to a disciplined attack. They perhaps have to look at their bowling combination and think of bringing in another seamer. On the other hand, there is a chance of Morne Morkel getting a game for the visitors. Compared to the first match, the weather looks much better and hopefully, we will get a full game.A warm welcome to our ball-by-ball coverage of the second ODI between South Africa and Bangladesh in Dhaka. The visitors started on a good note in the first match by registering a convincing victory. After incessant rain resulted in the game being reduced to 40 overs per side, their bowlers put up an impressive show to clean up the hosts for a modest total. Kagiso Rabada, on his debut, picked up a hat-trick and recorded the best figures by a debutant in ODIs. He certainly bowled with zest and vigour. For Bangladesh, Shakib Al Hasan, Rahim and Nasir Hossain tried to resurrect the innings, but in the end, they posted a below par total. Faf du Plessis then anchored the visitors to a facile win.Preview:Kagiso Rabada's record-breaking feat in the opening ODI helped South Africa thrash Bangladesh by eight wickets and the visitors will be looking to carry the momentum forward as they seek a series win in the second ODI in Mirpur. Meanwhile, the hosts, who were found wanting in all departments, will be eager to pull up their socks and show more application as they look to stay alive in the series.Rabada became only the second player to take a hat-trick on debut and also registered the best figures (6/18) on ODI debut. He may not come up with a similar show in the second game, but the South African team management will be hoping that the 20-year-old and his colleagues remain as disciplined as they were in the opening match. Faf du Plessis' fine half-century and his unbroken 99-run third-wicket stand with Rilee Rossouw helped the Proteas win with 8.5 overs to spare in a rain-curtailed encounter. While Hashim Amla will be hoping for the pair to continue the good work in the absence of AB de Villiers, the stand-in skipper will also be looking to contribute with the bat, having failed in the first game.Barring fighting knocks from Shakib Al Hasan (48) and Nasir Hossain (31), none of the Bangladesh batsmen had any answers to the youngster Rabada, who ripped through the batting order with minimum fuss. The batsmen had themselves to blame as most of them got out to poor strokes and lacked the discipline required against a good bowling attack. Skipper Mashrafe Mortaza, who admitted that the batsmen made a hash of things on a good batting wicket, will be hoping for a better performance from them, while he will also expect the bowlers to hit the right lines and not make it easy for the South African batsmen.Match Date: 12th July 2015Time: 15:00 local (14:30 IST)Venue: Shere Bangla National Stadium, MirpurWeather: Mostly clear skies, maximum of 34 degree CelsiusTeam News:Bangladesh:Bangladesh went in with eight batsmen for the first game and are likely to do so for the second match too, which means that they are likely to field the same eleven.
