It is now upto their bowlers to try and do what South Africa did the other night. That is defend a small total. Join us back in a few minutes for the run chase....4

It is good to have won the first match. No fuss with bowling first. We have not won many such games, so I wouldn't call it a great team yet. Just told the boys to go out there and give their best."Misbah: "We will bat first. It is a big advantage batting first. The ball will do a bit in the first one hour and after that it gets easier. It is about correcting the mistakes in the batting from the last match, we were in the game for 95 overs. Even when you need 5 to 6 runs you need to focus."Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "There is hardly any grass. It is very dry. Batting second has a slight advantage. Under lights it is a bit easier to bat. But the captains should not go with that theory. They should win the toss and bat first. There will be more runs today than the first match", says Kepler WesselsUmar Amin: "The mood in the camp is ok now. It was a bit frustrating when we lost the match. It was very frustrating when I got out. Everyday is a new day and we will try to correct the mistakes we made in the first game. It does not matter who plays in the other team, it is against a team that you play. Yes, I am fit to bowl, it depends upon the captain. This is a golden opportunity to beat them here as the conditions will favour us. We expect a good crowd as it is a Friday and a holiday here."Hello and welcome to the second ODI. South Africa got home in a 1-run thriller in the first match. Their batting was below par as they were restriced to 182 in their 50 overs. None of the batsmen got going and if it wasn't for Parnell who scored his maiden ODI fifty, they would have not even got to that score. The bowling was excellent as all the bowlers chipped in and held their nerves to pull off a thriller. As for Pakistan, as usual their bowling was the talking point, Ajmal created havoc as he picked up 4 wickets and had reduced South Africa to 6/86. But the batting let them down once again, as they were not able to get there even after being 165/4. They have to win this match and make it 1-1 before going to the third ODI. Toss and teams in a few minutes....Teams:Pakistan (From): Nasir Jamshed, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Amin, Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Sohail Tanvir, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Mohammad Irfan, Abdur Rehman, Junaid Khan, Asad Shafiq, Sarfraz Ahmed, Sohaib MaqsoodSouth Africa (From): Colin Ingram, Graeme Smith, Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(w/c), David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Imran Tahir, Robin Peterson, Vernon Philander, Quinton de KockLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
