That was a perfect display of setting the foundation and then taking matters into one's own hands for the launch. Marlon Samuels got into his artistic act quickly, with some glimpses of his Herculean avatar to get to his tenth ODI hundred. He took off from where he left in the last game and along with Ramdin for company delicately muscled together a 192-run partnership. In an innings peppered with some mighty blows, the major contribution came from some well judged quick ones. Once again, he seemed to get egged on by the verbal banter from the Aussie bowlers, who did really well in the initial overs, having the Windies on the mat at 31/3. So, with 283 to get for the Aussies to continue their stay in the Carribean, we are in for a crackerjack of a contest. Do join us in a bit for the chase..4

Starc to start procedings, here we go..Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Scott BolandWest Indies (Playing XI): Johnson Charles, Andre Fletcher, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Kieron Pollard, Jason Holder(c), Carlos Brathwaite, Sunil Narine, Sulieman Benn, Shannon GabrielHolder: "We would have wanted to bowl first but not sure about that, looks a good strip. We have got Australia in front of us. We have beaten them earlier, so they are going to come hard at us. Shannon Gabriel is making his debut, just like to wish him all the best."Australia have won the toss and have opted to fieldSmith: "Yes, same surface the other day. We are going to have a bowl. Look forward to chasing today. Knockout games bring the best out of the Australian teams. We are playing with the same team. We have got 400 caps between us. We are quite an inexperienced team. But such games are good for us."The pitch from what we are seeing looks a belter and the skies are pretty clear as of now. Win toss, bat first wicket?Australia will once again heavily rely on their potent weapon Mitchell Starc and the game might be decided on how West Indies cope with him. The condition is expected to be a bit cloudy and pace-friendly conditions would be the last thing West Indies want. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates which are not far from now12:00 Local Time, 16:00 GMT, 21:30 IST: Welcome all! Rain always plays a spoiler in cricket! Or does it not? It played the devil the other day, allowing only one over to be bowled in the Australia vs South Africa game. The washout has put Australia in a bit of a fix now. They have to win tonight to make the final. With only two games to go, the tournament is wide open. Any two teams can make the final. Should Australia lose, they will be out of the race. But things are a little better for Jason Holder's men, who will go through after a win tonight.PreviewThe washout on Sunday (June 19) against South Africa has complicated the equation for Australia, who now go into their final league match in a must-win situation. A loss for Steven Smith's men against West Indies will make the final league match, between the hosts and South Africa, merely an academic affair. On the other hand, Jason Holder's men are sailing in a similar boat as well. However, a win for them in one game should help them progress to the final.Australia's batting was a huge let-down in their last completed game, against West Indies, in St. Kitts. They were cruising along at one stage, only to falter in the final third of their innings and set up a chase which wasn't out of bounds for the host batsmen. If the batting in the last half was inadequate, the fielding and catching left a lot to be desired, with Usman Khawaja reprieving both West Indies openers. Understandably, the Australian skipper wasn't pleased with the efforts and called upon his team to main their high standards. With the final on the line, can Australia be at their best in all the three departments of the game?While Australia haven't looked sharp, hosts West Indies have blown hot and cold right throughout the tournament. Every win was followed by a disastrous thumping in the very next game. The two hammerings - one each, at the hands of Australia and South Africa, gave their opposition a bonus point victory, something that might well come back to haunt the men from the Caribbean Islands. They have batted well in patches - Kieron Pollard, in the win against South Africa at Guyana and Marlon Samuels, against Australia, in St. Kitts. Sunil Narine has been handy with the ball - but the team as a whole has struggled to match performance with consistency.When: June 21 at 1:00 PM local, 22:30 ISTWhere: Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, BarbadosWhat to expect: Unlike Sunday's washout, rain isn't expected to be a factor on Tuesday. The sun will be out, amidst some cloudy weather and the temperature is expected to be in the region of 26 degrees to 30 degrees celsius.Team News: Australia welcomed back Mitchell Starc and Glenn Maxwell for Sunday's washout against South Africa. They are unlikely to tinker with the playing XI for their final league match.The hosts have a reduced 13-man squad after the omission of pacer, Jerome Taylor, for the Barbados leg of the tournament. The conditions might just nudge them to play an extra pacer in the form of Shannon Gabriel, ahead of left-arm spinner, Suliemann Benn.Who said what:"We haven't done ourselves any favours in a sense that we haven't got ourselves automatically into the final like we would have liked, so it's good to see guys under pressure" - Australia's stand-in coach, Justin Langer, is happy to be put under the pump.'We asked one of our top batsmen to bat as deep as possible into the innings but we haven't been able to get that' - West Indies captain, Jason Holder, has placed emphasis on his batsmen to deliver the goods.Teams:Australia (From): Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Travis Head, Nathan Lyon, Adam ZampaWest Indies (From): Andre Fletcher, Johnson Charles, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Kieron Pollard, Jason Holder(c), Carlos Brathwaite, Sunil Narine, Sulieman Benn, Jonathan Carter, Shannon Gabriel, Ashley NurseLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
