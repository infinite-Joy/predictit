AUSTRALIA:32.5 Riaz to Watson, no run, steeply rising short of length delivery outside off stump, Watson hops and defendsThere is a man at leg slip now
AUSTRALIA:32.4 Riaz to Watson, FOUR, it's a fine little tickle and Australia get four more. Short of a length delivery down the leg-side, Watson gets inside the line and helps it on its way. Now Watson gives it back to Riaz. Umpire Dharmasena intervenes. Riaz and Misbah too weren't happy and they complained to the umpire
AUSTRALIA:32.3 Riaz to Watson, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, Watson defends
AUSTRALIA:32.2 Riaz to Watson, SIX, take that, Wahab Riaz! Michael Clarke applauds from the dressing room, he loved it. Short and just outside off stump, Watson rocks and pulls, hits it very hard and it goes flat over the deep mid-wicket boundary

AUSTRALIA:31.5 Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, FOUR, he'll smash you if you give him width. Shortish and wide outside off stump, Maxwell smashes it over extra-cover, it came off the bottom of the bat, but he hit it well enoughThe Australian dressing room looks very relaxed now.
AUSTRALIA:31.4 Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, no run, on-driven straight to mid-on this time. A couple of yards either side of the fielder would have been runs

AUSTRALIA:31.2 Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, no run, drives very well but straight to cover
AUSTRALIA:31.1 Ehsan Adil to Watson, 1 run, slower ball full toss, looked like Watson was surprised by the lack of the pace on it, but he managed to tap it wide of mid-on. That brings up his 33rd ODI fifty. Credit to him for hanging around despite that brilliant spell from Wahab Riaz
AUSTRALIA:30.6 Riaz to Maxwell, 2 runs, wow! A crunchy drive on the rise from Maxwell after playing a few rash shots. He looks so good when he times them sweetly and this time he sends it through extra-cover for a couple of runs

AUSTRALIA:30.2 Riaz to Maxwell, FOUR, oh my word! What sort of a shot is that? This is unfair for the bowler. He's actually outthought the batsman but it's four runs against his name. Maxwell backs away early, Riaz follows him with a short ball, Maxwell was cramped for room on the pull, the ball hit the bottom of the blade and raced away past backward point
AUSTRALIA:30.1 Riaz to Maxwell, FOUR, looks like Australia have it under control now! Riaz looks for the inswinging fuller length delivery, Maxwell waits for the ball and flicks it along the ground through mid-wicket

AUSTRALIA:29.1 Ehsan Adil to Maxwell, no run, steeply rising short of length delivery outside off stump, Maxwell cuts and missesEhsan Adil [3.0-0-11-1] is back into the attackHowever, at the other end, Steven Smith played with composure. He seems to have more time on his hands. Smith washed away the challenge of facing up to a fine pace attack with aplomb and composed a crucial fifty. Ehsan Adil then dismissed Smith to give Pakistan a glimmer of hope of coming back into the game. However, Sohail Khan dropped a catch as well to give Glenn Maxwell a reprieve. Riaz was again the unlucky bowler.Wahab Riaz continued to test Shane Watson with vicious bouncers. The strategy almost worked as Watson took his eyes off the ball while looking to pull Riaz, but Rahat Ali dropped a sitter at long leg. It wasn't just about Riaz bowling at scorching pace, but he bowled it head high and outside the off-stump, when he dug it short. The left-armer's angle also troubled Watson.Drinks are on the field now

AUSTRALIA:28.2 Riaz to Maxwell, 2 runs, another drop and Riaz has his hands on his head, a nothing shot from Maxwell, this was banged in short and on the stumps, Maxwell made room for the swat, got into a horrible position on the shot, it wasn't a pull, it wasn't a cross batted swipe, it wasn't a cut either, the ball loops over backward point. Sohail Khan gets across from the deep, gets his fingertips on that and can't hold on. Another costly miss for Pakistan
AUSTRALIA:28.1 Riaz to Watson, 1 run, back of a length and just outside off, punched wide of cover-point for a singleWahab Riaz [6.0-0-24-2] is back into the attackRiaz is back for perhaps one last fling. Can he trouble Watson once again? A slip and a silly short mid-wicket in place

AUSTRALIA:26.6 Ehsan Adil to Watson, no run, on a good length and just outside off, defended with a straight bat and back towards the bowler

AUSTRALIA:26.4 Ehsan Adil to S Smith, out Lbw!! Ehsan Adil has got the big wicket for Pakistan! This was full and on the stumps, perhaps nipped back in a bit, Smith was shuffling across a long way on the flick, misses and is struck on the pads, the impact seemed to be around leg, was it going on to hit the leg-stump? Umpire Dharmasena certainly thought so and lifted the dreaded finger. Smith doesn't have a challenge left with him and off he goes.

AUSTRALIA:14.1 Riaz to S Smith, no run, back of a length and on Smith's pads, turned towards backward short-leg. Maqsood is back under the helmet and he makes a smart stopFinch's opening partner, David Warner played some fine strokes. Whenever the pacers gave him any width, he took advantage of it by collecting runs. Steven Smith, who came in at the fall of Finch's wicket yet again showed masterful wrist-work to play shots through the on-side. However, Wahab Riaz took the key wicket of Warner. The credit has to go to Rahat Ali as well for taking a good catch at third man. Riaz then bounced out Michael Clarke to give Pakistan genuine hopes of coming back into the game. Riaz has certainly bowled a hostile spell. For Australia, they need Smith to shore up the innings. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis for the first 14 overs: Sohail Khan generated a bit of swing and more importantly, extracted seam movement to trouble Aaron Finch. Sohail's ability to nip it back into Finch paid rich dividends as he trapped him in front in the third over. Surprisingly, Finch went for the review and the original decision was rightly upheld. Finch hangs back in the crease and for a few overs against the white new ball, it is better to play with a straight bat.

AUSTRALIA:10.4 Riaz to Clarke, out Caught by Maqsood!! Clarke has been bounced out and Pakistan are right back in this!

It was the inswinger from Sohail Khan, Finch leans forward and fails to connect with the flick, the ball strikes him just below the kneeroll, ball would have crashed into middle and leg-stump. Finch lbw b Sohail Khan 2(5)Sohail Khan to Finch, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Finch has been given out LBW. He is discussing it with Warner. It has been reviewed. The third umpire says, If you could give me front foot first. It is fine and can you give me the front on vision? No bat invloved. Can you give me RTS? No inside edge. The tracker please. It is OUT, I will let you know when you are on camera Kumar, yes you are on and stay with your onfield decision.

AUSTRALIA:0.5 Sohail Khan to Finch, no run, huge shout for LBW, Sohail Khan was confident that he had his man. He asks the keeper and the slip cordon whether to review it or not, they say no. This one nips back in from a length, Finch comes slightly forward and misses the defence, is struck high on the pads and the ball lobs to second slip. No inside edge on that, height was the issue and Hawk-Eye shows it was just clipping the top of the stumps

AUSTRALIA:0.1 Sohail Khan to Warner, no run, fuller and just outside off, Warner leans forward and drives it to cover, that came off the middleWarner and Finch are at the crease. Warner is on strike. Sohail Khan will open the attackThe bowlers will have to bowl out of their skins if they have to restrict the strong Australian batting line-up. A couple of early wickets will help their cause. Can they achieve that? Misbah and his men are out in the middle. It might be the last time we might be seeing Misbah in the Pakistani colours. The countdown begins even as Warner marks his guard. Sohail Khan to open the attack. He has a couple of slips in place...Hello again... The Pakistani fast bowlers are already on the ground warming up. Waqar Younis is overlooking things. He would want the four pronged pace attack to make the most of the target that has been set.Hazlewood: "Very happy. I think the boys bowled well throughout the whole 50 overs. So, I think we are pretty happy with the total. The wicket is pretty good. It swung a little bit early, all in all, it's pretty good. It is great to be back in. We have quality depth in our squad of fast bowling. So, whenever you have a chance, you have to try and impress. I think so. Hopefully, we will get off to a good start. Just a matter of getting through the runs and off to a good start and hopefully chase them down."Pakistan have a fine bowling line-up and under lights, it may not be easy to bat. The lowest winning ODI total at this ground is 140, when Wasim Raja bowled an inspired spell to help Pakistan skittle out the West Indies for just 132, but that game took place back in 1981. In short, Australia should fancy their chances of chasing down this paltry target to reach the semi-finals. Among the bowlers, Starc bowled with great rhythm. He swung the new ball and with the old ball, bowled from around the wicket to generate reverse swing. With subtle changes of wrist and fingers, he is causing all sorts of problems to opposition ranks in this World Cup. He is bowling with a good burst of pace too. Starc's partner in crime with the new ball, Hazlewood, bowled parsimoniously and took four wickets. With Maxwell taking a couple of key scalps as well, Australia gained the upper hand. On expected lines, their fielding was top notch.It was the impressive Mitchell Starc, who made the initial breakthrough by snaffling Sarfraz Ahmed's wicket. Sarfraz's tendency to guide it through the slip cordon cost his wicket. The metronomic Josh Hazlewood, known for his unrelenting control and untiring stamina, then struck by sending Ahmed Shehzad back to the pavilion. For the umpteenth time in his career, Misbah-ul-Haq had to lead from the front. He bided his time before clouting Glenn Maxwell for a couple of sixes. However, in an attempt to up the scoring rate, he perished and was dismissed by Maxwell. Haris Sohail had his fair share of luck, before he threw his wicket away. Pakistan found themselves in more trouble, when Umar Akmal too gifted his wicket away. Shahid Afridi slashed and bashed his way to play a cameo, but today was the day he needed to crack a half-century.The well-oiled Australian bowling unit landed crucial blows at regular intervals to bundle out the opposition for a modest total. In fact, it could be said that the poor shot selection by most of Pakistan's batsmen also played a part in them losing the plot. The pacers generally bowled with good control to join the dots and frustrate the batsmen. The strategy worked superbly for them. 4

PAKISTAN:37.6 Faulkner to Riaz, no run, shortens the length on off, defended back to the bowler
PAKISTAN:37.5 Faulkner to Riaz, no run, now he is beaten by the back of a length delivery as well. Riaz stays in the crease and went for the steer down to third man, the ball grazes past the outside edge. Not clever cricket from Riaz as there is a slip in place
PAKISTAN:37.4 Faulkner to Riaz, no run, good length ball around off, Riaz comes half-forward and dabs it to backward point
PAKISTAN:37.3 Faulkner to Riaz, no run, beaten! It is again the fuller length that is causing problems for Riaz, he is not fully forward as he fiddles with it, the angle across beats the outside edge
PAKISTAN:37.2 Faulkner to Riaz, no run, no footwork whatsoever from Riaz, full and slanted across off, Riaz goes for it with laden feet, is lucky not to have nicked it
PAKISTAN:37.1 Faulkner to Maqsood, 1 run, fullish and outside off, Maqsood creams the drive to sweeper cover

PAKISTAN:36.5 Starc to Maqsood, 1 run, that is a rare sight, Warner misfielding. Fuller and outside off, Maqsood square drives it with an open bat face to point, Warner allows the ball go through his legs, Smith from cover tidies up
PAKISTAN:36.4 Starc to Riaz, 1 run, drags the length back, Riaz camps on the back foot and nurdles it square of the wicket on the leg-side
PAKISTAN:36.3 Starc to Riaz, no run, yorker just outside off, Riaz tries to squeeze it out, but is beaten by the pace on the deliveryTwo slips in place for Riaz
PAKISTAN:36.2 Starc to Maqsood, 1 run, in the air and safe! Banged in midway down the wicket, Maqsood is hurried on the pull, he splices it towards mid-wicket, Watson was at mid-on and runs across rather gingerly and takes it on the bounce. A far more agile fielder would have got there
PAKISTAN:36.1 Starc to Maqsood, 2 runs, call was for two and they get it easily. Maqsood shuffles across his stumps to the back of a length delivery, flicks it through the vacant mid-wicket region for a bracePakistani batsmen have been lured into destruction by the sight of the short square boundaries, reckons Rajaraman from the ground. Too many poor shots, he says: 'three catches on the shortest boundary on the leg-side, poor cricket from the middle-order' - he adds.
PAKISTAN:35.6 Faulkner to Maqsood, 1 run, good over to start the powerplay for Australia, just 1 run off it. On a length and on off, Maqsood wrists it to the right of Faulkner, who makes a half-stop and the batsmen pinch a single
PAKISTAN:35.5 Faulkner to Maqsood, no run, pitched up and in the slot for Maqsood, who drills the drive to extra cover. Either side of the fielder and he would have collected four
PAKISTAN:35.4 Faulkner to Maqsood, no run, shortens the length, Maqsood punches it down the wicket, Faulkner bends down and kicks the ball forward, the batsmen think about the run but Haddin gets there quickly
PAKISTAN:35.3 Faulkner to Maqsood, no run, Maqsood is hitting them well, but is often picking out the fielder, on-drives it straight to mid-on
PAKISTAN:35.2 Faulkner to Maqsood, no run, fullish and around off, Maqsood drives and picks out coverPakistan would have loved to have had Afridi at the crease now. But that is not to be.
PAKISTAN:35.1 Faulkner to Maqsood, no run, back of a length around off, Maqsood punches it to mid-offJames Faulkner [2.0-0-5-0] is back into the attackThe batting powerplay has been enforced.
PAKISTAN:34.6 Starc to Riaz, no run, Starc beats Riaz on the drive outside off, full and angled across the batsman, Riaz was feeling for the ball and was lucky not to have nicked it

PAKISTAN:34.4 Starc to Maqsood, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, Maqsood opens the face of the bat and carves it to deep backward point, Finch runs around and slides to pull it back to the other fielder coming across, he passes the ball on to him and saves two
PAKISTAN:34.3 Starc to Maqsood, no run, Maqsood shuffles across to off and drives well, but picks out mid-off
PAKISTAN:34.2 Starc to Maqsood, no run, full and wide outside off, Maqsood throws his bat at that and fails to connect. Gave it his all and missed
PAKISTAN:34.1 Starc to Maqsood, no run, short of length on off, punched back to StarcWahab Riaz, right handed bat, comes to the creaseMitchell Starc [4.0-1-18-1] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:33.6 Hazlewood to Afridi, out Caught by Finch!! Is this the last time that we will see Afridi bat in ODIs? Can never be sure with him! Hazlewood pumps his fist as Afridi throws it away. Poor cricketing sense from Afridi, he wanted to hit every ball out of the park and Finch takes a good catch above his head at deep mid-wicket. He was positioned on the edge of the boundary and took it well. On a length and on the stumps, Afridi swung and aimed for the leg-side boundary, hit it well, but didn't hit it to clear the fielder. Finch leapt a little too as he caught it. Afridi c Finch b Hazlewood 23(15) [4s-3 6s-1]Hazlewood to Afridi, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:33.5 Hazlewood to Maqsood, 1 run, short outside off, Maqsood hops and cuts to square third man, for a single. Rode the bounce well there
PAKISTAN:33.4 Hazlewood to Afridi, 1 run, shuffles across and takes it on the full, wristed wide of mid-on
PAKISTAN:33.3 Hazlewood to Afridi, FOUR, Afridi is providing action. That is a slog and the thick top edge clears Haddin comfortably. Dug in short and Afridi gets forward to pull and gets lucky
PAKISTAN:33.2 Hazlewood to Afridi, no run, now Hazlewood beats Afridi with one that held its line outside off, Afridi had no room to guide that down to third man, it was too close to him and he missed with an open face, very close to both edge and off stump
PAKISTAN:33.1 Hazlewood to Afridi, no run, cross-seam from Hazlewood, Afridi is early into the pull and misses. Went too hard at it and missedHis partner at the other end, Haris Sohail, played some fine shots, but had his moments of indiscretion, where he looked to slog across the line. With the current field restrictions around, it is easier to target over mid-on and mid-off regions. Australian bowlers joining all those dots eventually, led to the dismissal of Haris and his wicket was snared by Mitchell Johnson. To make it worse for Pakistan, Umar Akmal threw his wicket away by getting out to Maxwell. For them to post a competitive total, they need Shahid Afridi to fire on all cylinders.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis for the last 17 overs: Misbah-ul-Haq yet again tried to steer Pakistan to safe waters. Interestingly, Misbah has his own method of constructing an innings. Even when the pacers bowled half volleys, he looked to defend on the front foot. However, as soon as Glenn Maxwell came into the attack, he thwacked the offspinner for two sixes. Just in the nick of time though, Maxwell dismissed Misbah, with Aaron Finch taking an excellent catch in the deep.Time for a Drinks break
PAKISTAN:32.6 Johnson to Maqsood, 2 runs, hops across and tucks this through mid-wicket, two it is
PAKISTAN:32.5 Johnson to Maqsood, no run, Maqsood is into the pull early, this was a slower ball bouncer, cutter and Maqsood is hit on the body
PAKISTAN:32.4 Johnson to Maqsood, no run, back of a length on off, defended back to Johnson
PAKISTAN:32.3 Johnson to Afridi, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Afridi gets forward to drive and gets a thick outside edge to third man
PAKISTAN:32.2 Johnson to Afridi, no run, Johnson comes back well with a full delivery outside off, Afridi drives and is beaten. Lack of footwork doing him in
PAKISTAN:32.1 Johnson to Afridi, SIX, extraordinary shot from Boom Boom! He hasn't timed that, but still gets six over sweeper's head. Full and outside off, Afridi sliced the uppish carve and Finch saw the ball fly over his head. The short square boundaries helping Afridi. Maqsood goes up and pats Afridi
PAKISTAN:31.6 Hazlewood to Maqsood, FOUR, Maqsood takes a risk and it comes off. Shortish outside off, Maqsood had already decided to pull and short-arm jabbed it over mid-on, inside the ring, one bounce over the ropes. Connected that well and a pressure-releasing boundary
PAKISTAN:31.5 Hazlewood to Maqsood, no run, back of a length on the stumps, punched back to Hazlewood
PAKISTAN:31.4 Hazlewood to Afridi, 1 run, Afridi opens the face of the bat and guides it to third man, the fielder gets around quickly to keep it to a singleA slip in place for Afridi

PAKISTAN:31.2 Hazlewood to Maqsood, no run, short outside off, Maqsood has cut that to Warner at point, there is a fumble, but they don't risk the single. Maqsood has missed out thereAkmal was so livid with himself after getting out, that he could've done serious damage to his shin or thigh after hitting the bat into his pad. Wonder what would've happened had he missed the pad, such was the ferocity of the smash from Akmal. Maxwell couldn't believe his luck too
PAKISTAN:31.1 Hazlewood to Maqsood, 2 runs, shortish outside off, Maqsood cuts and gets a thick edge down to third man, couple takenJosh Hazlewood [6.0-0-18-1] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:30.6 Johnson to Afridi, no run, slower delivery outside off, Afridi drives and one hand comes off the bat handle as he does so, Warner at point dives to field that

PAKISTAN:30.3 Johnson to Maqsood, no run, short of length on the stumps, Maqsood softly turns it back to the right of Johnson
PAKISTAN:30.2 Johnson to Maqsood, no run, have to call that a dropped catch. Maqsood was surprised by the short ball, closes the face of the bat too early and pops a leading edge to the left of Johnson, he got a hand but couldn't hang on. Johnson had to change direction and couldn't do so in time, which would've given him more time to catch it. Clarke was jumping up, thinking Johnson had it
PAKISTAN:30.1 Johnson to Maqsood, no run, on a good length and outside off, Maqsood punches it to mid-off
PAKISTAN:29.6 Maxwell to Afridi, FOUR, Afridi attacks Maxwell and gets a boundary. Charges the bowler and blasts it wide of long-off. Beats the fielder too. Hit very hard by Afridi

PAKISTAN:29.4 Maxwell to Afridi, no run, tossed up outside off, driven straight to the fielder at cover

PAKISTAN:29.2 Maxwell to Afridi, 2 runs, gets off the mark with a pre-meditated paddle to fine leg, for a couple of runsShahid Afridi, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:29.1 Maxwell to U Akmal, out Caught by Finch!! What have you done, Akmal? Inexplicable really. He has hit a rank half-tracker from Maxwell straight to deep mid-wicket. Akmal rocked back to pull and couldn't have placed it any better, if he had tried to. Finch hangs on, clutching the ball to his chest. It came in flat and Finch was unsighted for a moment, but takes a good catch. Maxwell roars in delight. Akmal was frustrated that he hit the bat hard into his pads. U Akmal c Finch b Maxwell 20(25) [4s-2]Maxwell to U Akmal, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:28.6 Johnson to U Akmal, 1 run, works the length ball to deep backward square leg, for a single
PAKISTAN:28.5 Johnson to U Akmal, FOUR, fab shot. Just a punch from Akmal. Timed it so well that it raced away, but Shane Watson's effort from mid-off was very poor. He just ambled after the ball and made no effort to stop it. Escorted it to the boundary. Watson's running resembles a bit of Ashwin - both extremely slow movers on the field
PAKISTAN:28.4 Johnson to U Akmal, no run, off-cutter from Johnson, Akmal defends to point
PAKISTAN:28.3 Johnson to U Akmal, no run, Akmal went hard on the drive, but Johnson leapt high and pulled the ball down, mid-on is there to cover up. Clarke applauds that effort from JohnsonA slip in for Akmal

PAKISTAN:26.6 Johnson to Maqsood, 2 runs, low full toss outside off, Maqsood gets forward and drives in the gap at cover, a couple to get him off the mark
PAKISTAN:26.5 Johnson to Maqsood, no run, swings back into Maqsood who punches well but finds mid-onSohaib Maqsood, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:26.4 Johnson to Sohail, out Caught by Haddin!! The round the wicket angle has got Sohail. Johnson punches the air. Sohail leaves with a grimace on his face. It was well outside off and going further away, Sohail's feet went nowhere as he went for a flashy drive, the nick went to Haddin's left who pouched it. Johnson is rewarded for his persistence. Sohail c Haddin b Johnson 41(57) [4s-4]Johnson to Sohail, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:26.3 Johnson to Sohail, no run, dug in short, outside off, Sohail arches back and lets it goJohnson is now coming round the wicket to Sohail

PAKISTAN:26.1 Johnson to Sohail, 1 run, length on middle and leg, flicked to deep backward square leg
PAKISTAN:25.6 Maxwell to U Akmal, FOUR, Akmal rocks back and cuts hard and in the gap at point. Haddin flicked the bail off and Maxwell started appealing, thinking Akmal had trod on his stumps, but replays clearly proved that wrong. Akmal didn't know what the fuss was all about. He knew he hadn't gone anywhere near the stumpsDid Haddin flick the bails off with his glove? Yes he did. There is an appeal for hit wicket. But Haddin said he wasn't sure. So it has gone up to the third umpire. Replays show that it was Haddin who has removed the bail
PAKISTAN:25.5 Maxwell to U Akmal, no run, tossed up outside off, pushed to square leg
PAKISTAN:25.4 Maxwell to U Akmal, no run, gets forward and flicks to short mid-wicket

PAKISTAN:25.1 Maxwell to U Akmal, 2 runs, turning in, bounced too, Akmal rocked back and cut it to the right of backward point, two it is

PAKISTAN:24.4 Johnson to U Akmal, no run, short now, Akmal ducks under that
PAKISTAN:24.3 Johnson to U Akmal, no run, outside off, left aloneMisbah had to fetch that from well outside off and also his bat turned on impact when he hit it. Clarke brought back Maxi to tempt Misbah and the Pakistani captain fell for the bait. Kept a deep mid-wicket and deep square leg, asked Misbah to take the offie on. Credit to Maxi too for tossing it up despite getting hit for two sixes previously. Misbah eyed the short square boundary at the Adelaide Oval, but couldn't clear that time
PAKISTAN:24.2 Johnson to U Akmal, no run, Akmal is comprehensively beaten as he played down the wrong line, angled across Akmal who was fiddling outside off
PAKISTAN:24.1 Johnson to U Akmal, no run, Akmal gets forward to drive and inside-edges it onto his boot, the ball rolls to mid-off, they decide against the quick singleMitchell Johnson [5.0-0-19-0] is back into the attack

PAKISTAN:23.4 Maxwell to U Akmal, 2 runs, edged and no slip! Akmal went for a big drive first ball and edged it through the vacant slip position. Maxwell can't believe that he hasn't got a slip there
PAKISTAN:23.3 Maxwell to Sohail, 1 run, Sohail comes down the track and drives it to long-offUmar Akmal, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:23.2 Maxwell to Misbah, out Caught by Finch!! Misbah holes out. The bowling change has worked. The overspinner from Maxwell, it was outside off, Misbah looked for another biggie, but top-edged the slog sweep and Finch running around from deep mid-wicket has taken a good catch. Gets a high-five from the man at deep square leg. Misbah c Finch b Maxwell 34(59) [4s-1 6s-2]Maxwell to Misbah, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

PAKISTAN:21.3 Faulkner to Misbah, leg byes, 1 run, Misbah shuffles across and the ball pitched outside leg, fails to flick and the ball hits the thigh pad. Mild appeal for lbw, but that died down very quickly

PAKISTAN:21.1 Faulkner to Sohail, 1 run, length on middle and leg, worked away to deep square leg

PAKISTAN:20.4 Watson to Sohail, 1 run, now stays beside the line of the ball and dabs the length ball close to his body, down to square third man
PAKISTAN:20.3 Watson to Sohail, FOUR, that is a much better hit. Clears his front leg and then goes over mid-on. Inside the ring. It was a length ball and Sohail connected well to clear the fielder, although the bat turned in his hand. The fielder was in very close at mid-on
PAKISTAN:20.2 Watson to Sohail, 2 runs, just over Haddin! Sohail went for the pull, but it went off the glove and Haddin leapt back, acrobatically and the ball just lobbed his right-mitt. Didn't even get a finger on it. Sohail is itching to go hard and gets lucky
PAKISTAN:20.1 Watson to Sohail, no run, in the air, but well in front of mid-off. Sohail timed the off-drive uppishly and Watson goes 'ooooo' as the ball doesn't carry

PAKISTAN:17.6 Maxwell to Misbah, SIX, second six for Misbah. A mini helicopter that from Misbah. His version of it. It was very full and Misbah went deep in his crease and then cleared wide long-on with a big clout. Extended followthrough as well. Calculated risk and it has paid off
PAKISTAN:17.5 Maxwell to Sohail, 1 run, Sohail comes down the track and drives to long-off
PAKISTAN:17.4 Maxwell to Sohail, no run, fullish and outside off stump, driven to the right of cover

PAKISTAN:17.1 Maxwell to Misbah, no run, flatter ball just outside off stump, Misbah defends off the back foot
PAKISTAN:16.6 Johnson to Misbah, 1 run, oh! The inside edge found but it goes past the sticks. Just a bit of inswing on this fuller length delivery, Misbah looks to drive off the front foot, but only manages to get a thick edge, luckily for him, it missed the stumps and went to fine leg
PAKISTAN:16.5 Johnson to Misbah, no run, full and outside off stump, Misbah pushes it off the front foot to mid-off
PAKISTAN:16.4 Johnson to Misbah, no run, pitched up outside off, driven well, but straight to the fielder at mid-off
PAKISTAN:16.3 Johnson to Misbah, no run, well-directed short delivery from Misbah, who rises onto his toes and keeps it down. Looks for a run to short mid-wicket, but Sohail says no
PAKISTAN:16.2 Johnson to Sohail, 3 runs, nice on-drive straight down the ground, past mid-on. They run well and take three, by the time the ball is thrown back
PAKISTAN:16.1 Johnson to Sohail, no run, short of length on the stumps, defended to mid-onSarfraz has the habit of guiding it through the slip cordon, but on a deck that offers a bit of bounce, it was always going to be a risky shot. Josh Hazlewood followed up Starc's effort by hitting good lengths and was rewarded with the wicket of Shehzad. Pakistan could have found themselves in trouble, but the ball hit the leg bail and it didn't come down. Misbah-ul-Haq was the lucky batsman, with Hazlewood being the unlucky bowler on that occasion. Haris Sohail and Misbah then looked to steady Pakistan's innings. Michael Clarke, on his part, showed good captaincy by positioning a fielder at gully for Hazlewood as he extracts bounce. It is a fielding position that seems to have gone out of fashion in the modern era.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis for the first 16 overs: It was Mitchell Starc, who opened the bowling for Australia. He mainly generated inswing, but for a brief period, Ahmed Shehzad and Sarfraz Ahmed handled him reasonably well. The openers looked to stand outside the crease to negate Starc's swing. Unfortunately for Pakistan, Sarfraz was dismissed in the fifth over on the back of a fine catch taken by Shane Watson at first slip off Starc's bowlingDrinks are on the field now
PAKISTAN:15.6 Maxwell to Misbah, no run, beautiful bowling and nearly the outside edge. This one was bowled well outside off, turned back in slightly with a bit of extra bounce, Misbah was looking to punch and missed. Ever so close to the nick. Maxwell thought he had his man. Misbah appreciates that it was a good delivery by nodding
PAKISTAN:15.5 Maxwell to Misbah, no run, flatter outside off, punched to cover
PAKISTAN:15.4 Maxwell to Sohail, 1 run, gets forward and drives to long-on
PAKISTAN:15.3 Maxwell to Sohail, no run, comes down the track and isn't to the pitch, so taps it back to Maxwell
PAKISTAN:15.2 Maxwell to Sohail, no run, good call by Misbah to send Sohail back. Punched to cover-point's left, Sohail wanted a single, Warner was the fielder who dived and got up in motion to throw it back to the keeper, by then Sohail was back

PAKISTAN:14.6 Johnson to Misbah, no run, pitched up outside off, Misbah is brought forward, defended to cover

PAKISTAN:14.4 Johnson to Misbah, no run, from round the wicket now, Misbah defends with an open face to point
PAKISTAN:14.3 Johnson to Misbah, 2 runs, good work by Smith but Pakistan pinch two. Tucked to backward square leg, Smith ran and then slid to pull the back in with the other hand, had the presence of mind to throw it to the bowler's end, but Sohail is quick
PAKISTAN:14.2 Johnson to Sohail, 1 run, Sohail plays it late and glides it down to third man. Played close to his body and let it run off the face of the bat
PAKISTAN:14.1 Johnson to Sohail, no run, short of length on the stumps, Sohail awkwardly defends down the wicket, the bat turned on impact a tad there
PAKISTAN:13.6 Maxwell to Misbah, SIX, that was the shot he was looking for, last ball. Now he connects handsomely, almost into the first tier, tossed up by Maxwell and slog-swept by Misbah. First six of the innings
PAKISTAN:13.5 Maxwell to Misbah, no run, very full on the stumps, Misbah was looking for the lofted slog-sweep, but drives it back to Maxwell
PAKISTAN:13.4 Maxwell to Sohail, 1 run, Sohail shows the full face of the bat and drives to long-off
PAKISTAN:13.3 Maxwell to Sohail, no run, flatter and punched to cover
PAKISTAN:13.2 Maxwell to Misbah, 1 run, Misbah gets forward and drives to long-offNo-one behind the wicket catching for Maxwell

The bail lit up and the Aussies were confused as to what had happened there. Hazlewood started celebrating and then the Aussies got around to confer with each otherWhat has happened there? The Aussies want a review for an lbw. Clarke is talking to Erasmus and after a discussion they move on. Dharmasena says it is time over. Hoho! The ball has hit the leg bail and it hasn't come down.

PAKISTAN:4.4 Starc to Sarfraz Ahmed, out Caught by Watson!! Good take by Watto. At first slip. Diving across to his right. Got it with both hands. 17th wicket for Starc in the tournament. Bowled at 150kph and angled across Sarfraz Ahmed, on a short of length, the batsman made the mistake of playing with an open face and just guided that, Watto moved smartly and takes it well.

PAKISTAN:1.6 Hazlewood to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, Sarfraz Ahmed is an aggressive player and wants to go hard early on, but that is a loose stroke. Once again the feet didn't move at all as he aimed a waft at a good length delivery outside off, swung and beat the bat. Hazlewood has got swing this over, which should encourage him
PAKISTAN:1.5 Hazlewood to Sarfraz Ahmed, leg byes, FOUR, down leg and it beats the diving Haddin to his left, straight off the thigh pad and it is four leg byes

PAKISTAN:0.3 Starc to Sarfraz Ahmed, no run, Smith at cover dives to his left and saves a couple at least. Nicely driven on-the-up and Smith went quickly. Gets a pat from the point fielder

Ahmed Shehzad is on strike. Starc will open the attackAhmed Shehzad scratches his guard out. Sarfraz is at the other end. The countdown begins. Shane Warne thinks that it is a good toss to lose. Only time will tell whether Warnie is right. Starc to go. Two slips in place as he runs in. Here we go then...The officials are out. As do the players for the anthems. Afridi has his eyes closed while singing the anthem. While Bailey and Warner have a huge smile on their faces. All the Aussies belt the anthem out aloud. Great scenes. Once the anthems are done, it is time for the action to begin.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh HazlewoodPakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Haris Sohail, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Sohail Khan, Rahat Ali, Ehsan AdilPakistan have won the toss and have opted to batClarke: "We've got a full 15 to choose from today, so that's a great problem to have for the selectors. All the boys are looking forward to today. I am not that bothered (to lose the toss) to be honest. Looks like a beautiful wicket. You've got to bowl at some stage, why not start now. One change, Josh Hazlewood comes in for Pat Cummins. They've left a little bit of grass on it, so I think we will see some good pace and carry and hopefully a little bit of seam with the new ball."Misbah: "I believe it's all about momentum and we've got the right momentum at the moment. Winning four games in a row, I think everybody is confident. That's the ideal type of situation we need to have before the knockout stage. We are going to bat first. Looks like there is a bit more pace and bounce and it might assist the seamers. This (pitch) looks a little bit different from the last two pitches. Let's see. We've been bowling in the night. So even movement with the new ball, seam movement and little bit of more carry and bounce has really helped. I am not sure about reverse swing today bowling in the night, but I think we will get little bit of conventional swing. We are going in with the same side that played against Ireland."It's toss time!Pitch report by Damien Fleming: The sun is out. The pitch looks an absolute belter. Nice and hard and flat. If the opening bowlers pitch the ball up, they should get some traditional swing. With a well-grassed pitch, it won't deteriorate much for reverse swing to come into play in the last 10 overs. India scored 300, Bangladesh 275, if you get in, pace and bounce will be consistent, so you should be able to score around that 275-300 mark.Tom Moody has the latest Australian team news. He tweets: 'Australian selectors go with bounce against pace, Josh Hazlewood replaces @93Cummins for todays QF in Adelaide.'"When you have a goal of winning the World Cup, you have to beat any team on the way," said Misbah, who admitted a Pakistan win would be regarded as an upset.Quotes: Michael Clarke is pretty clear in his head: 'Tomorrow will be a tough challenge and I believe we have to be at our best to beat them.'Weather update: It rarely rains in Adelaide, so no worries about the weather. It is expected to be pleasant conditions with a high of 28C predicted.Pakistan: In a big blow to Pakistan, the giant, Mohammad Irfan has been ruled out of the World Cup due to a stress fracture in his right hip. His replacement, Ehsan Adil played in the game against Ireland and could hold onto his spot. Yasir Shah still has to wait to make his second World Cup appearance.Pre-match team news, Australia: The only bone of contention for Australia is to choose between Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood. The rest of the team picks itself.He added that the choice of the replacement would be up to the team management. "If Pakistan proceeds to the semi-final, then a replacement will be sent and it could be Ajmal. It could also be Junaid Khan. When Junaid and Mohammad Hafeez had got injured, I had suggested that Ajmal should be sent as a replacement but the tour selection committee wanted a fast bowler and an opener as replacement," he added.A bit of heart-warming news for all Pakistani fans. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan has said that Saeed Ajmal could be sent as a replacement for Mohammad Irfan if Pakistan defeats Australia in the quarter-final in Adelaide and qualifies for the semi-finals.The Pakistan skipper also added that his squad were in upbeat mood after a run of wins that included a victory over highly-fancied South Africa. "I think four straight wins gives you a lot of confidence as a playing unit, the mindset is good and the momentum is with us and this is the best time to play against such a good team because we are also in a good frame of mind," said Misbah.Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq reckons Australia will be favourites to win but added that the tag of favourites would count for little in a knockout game. "They (Australia) are favourites but there is no hard-and-fast rule that favourites are always going to win the match," said Misbah. "It's which team performs better on the day, takes their chances and have some luck, they can really defeat any team," he added. "We are positive and hopeful. I think we've got a bowling line-up which can go through any batting line-up."What are the headlines doing the rounds before the game? Michael Clarke says his side start on zero again. "When you walk out on the field tomorrow it's a new day," Clarke said. "We all start on zero with the bat and zero with the ball as well. The past is the past. We need to turn up tomorrow and play our best cricket if we want to beat Pakistan, it's as simple as that. I don't think you are ever owed anything in this game of cricket so we have to make sure we're ready to go tomorrow, which we will be."Pakistan are a mercurial side and very unpredictable as everyone knows. In a knockout game, it wouldn't be wise to write them off, even though Australia are firm favorites. It takes only one bad day to go out of the tournament at this stage and Pakistan will certainly be preying on that stat.Four wins on the bounce has given Pakistan momentum. The batting was the weak link especially at the top of the order and they rectified that by including Sarfraz from the South Africa game. That decision proved to be a fine choice as the diminutive keeper batsman injected life into a dull batting line-up. Younis Khan hasn't made runs though and so has Sohaib Maqsood. More is expected from Umar Akmal too. Misbah remains the only consistent performer with the bat. That should worry Pakistan a bit. But the quickies have responded magnificently although Mohammad Irfan would be a big loss.Pakistan: Their campaign started off pretty much like the 1992 tournament. Losses to India and West Indies left them in danger of not even reaching the quarter-finals. There was some stinging criticism from ex-players directed at Misbah after those two losses. The pressure was on Pakistan and how well they have responded. A close win against Zimbabwe, which was a gritty performance set them back on track. A big win over UAE followed. But it was the game against South Africa that Pakistan really came alive. On a spicy Eden Park wicket, Pakistan were inspired with the ball as the four seamers sent South Africa hurtling to defeat, despite not having a huge score to defend. Coming into their last game against Ireland, Pakistan needed a win to progress. A defeat would've ended their hopes there. Sarfraz came to the party with a hundred as Pakistan booked a quarter-final date with Australia.The Aussies look the most complete outfit amongst all the teams in the tournament. Warner, Finch, Smith, Clarke and Maxwell all have made runs with the bat. Their batting carries a destructive look with Starc at 10. They have tinkered with the bowling attack still unsure of what their best bowling line-up is. Starc has undoubtedly been the leader of the pack and is the bowler of the tournament. His swinging yorkers at the death have proved to be unhittable and he is the one to watch out for. Johnson has been disappointing and has leaked runs. But with Starc in such form, Australia are afforded the luxury of a few expensive bowlers.Road to the quarter-final: Australia have had a smooth passage into the quarters winning four out of their six games. They smashed England in the opener and then proceeded to win against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Scotland. All four were convincing wins with Australia posting huge totals on the board. Their game against Bangladesh was washed out while they suffered a one-wicket loss to New Zealand in one of the most thrilling games of this tournament. Mitchell Starc nearly produced a miracle at Eden Park in a crazy game, but Kane Williamson's monk like exterior thwarted the Aussies.It was Pakistan's greatest night and one that they will never forget. Wondering why so much focus on Pakistan's World Cup win in 1992. Because it came in Australia. And there are so many similarities to that 1992 campaign. What about Australia you may ask? Well we are getting there exactly. Moving on, let us dwell on how Australia have done so far in this World Cup.Imran described the win as his greatest ever achievement. "I rate the moments after the World Cup victory as the most pleasing and satisfying of my career as I had never seen the people of Pakistan so happy," the International Cricket Council quoted him as saying. Imran's win had a philanthropic side attached to it as well as he used the funds generated from the win to realise his lifelong ambition of building a cancer hospital in memory of his late mother. The dream came true as the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center, opened in Lahore on December 29, 1994."The team were in awe of Imran," said Fazal, "We just looked at each other and said Imran 'must be a sorcerer or something'."Later, after the victory, Imran said: "I told you we would win."So how did Wasim Akram feel after winning the biggest prize? "It sunk in that we won the World Cup only two or three days later. First of all, we couldn't sleep that night. I remember I had to share half a sleeping pill with Ijaz (Ahmed) to go to bed because we couldn't sleep till three or four in the morning."Imran Khan was one man who believed that his side could win even when his team-mates thought otherwise. Imran would say, at every team meeting: "We will win before we leave." The 12th man on that day at the MCG, Zahid Fazal, recalled how Imran kept believing despite an embarrassing performance against England in the league game. "After we were bowled out for 74, we packed our bags [because we thought we were finished]. But Imran insisted we would still win the World Cup."Imran had done it. Pakistan had done it. It was an epochal night for Pakistan, in front of a then-record crowd of 87,182 at the MCG. Imran had inspired his side to World Cup glory. At the age of 39. On his last legs. At the last attempt. After coming back from retirement. No-one could've written a script like that too. It was destined to end this way. Not in despair like in 1987. Sport did give him a fairytale ending. Destiny played its part too. The stars aligned themselves perfectly to make this possible. A champion had ended his career a World Cup winner. The World Cup sat comfortably in his arms. The circle was complete. The dream realised. The journey done. Imran Khan - World Cup winner. Pakistan - World Champions. Imran wanted to see this. He did.Ian Botham who was dismissed by Wasim Akram in the final felt that the left-arm seamer was the real deal. "The one player who really stood out for me was Wasim Akram. It was in that tournament that we realised just what a special talent he was and how much trouble he was going to give us and the rest of the world in the years to come. What a player he was."Here is another example of Imran's man-management skills. Wasim Akram had a huge problem with no-balls and wides during the 1992 World Cup. He was bowling with the white Kookaburra and found himself unable to control his swing. Also he repeatedly overstepped striving for more pace. Imran though trusted his ace and said this to the local newspapers: "I don't mind Wasim bowling no-balls as long as he bowls quick". Wasim repaid his captain's trust with a Man of the Match performance.So what did Imran have in mind for the final? Any new surprise? Yes there was one. He sported a t-shirt with a tiger's picture on it at the toss. Many were stunned and curious to know why he had done so. "If the boys play like tigers then I don't mind if they win or lose," he famously remarked. Before the final, he had asked his team to play like "Cornered Tigers". They did just that beating England by 22 runs with Imran fittingly taking the final wicket. Imran had promoted himself to three to protect the middle-order and his move proved to be a masterstroke. Along with Javed Miandad, he added 139 runs for the third wicket in 31 overs. Imran made 72 - which took Pakistan to 249. It was a huge decision to take, but Imran trusted himself so much. When he was not in form! Another of Imran's proteges, Wasim Akram lit up the MCG with a stunning display with ball in hand. Wasim had earlier made a cameo 18-ball 33 with the bat and was confidence personified with the ball.The semi-final win was one more example of Imran backing his players. Now onto the final. First time ever Pakistan had reached the World Cup final after three failed semi-final results. The greatest night of Imran's career. Or would it end in tears? The venue - MCG with more than 1 lakh expected for the final. Against England who were favoured to win. England were playing some sublime cricket led from the front by another of Imran's great rivals, Ian Botham. Imran had lived all his life for this occasion and he deserved to be there.Miandad was impressed. Pakistan had gone through to the final and Imran's decision to keep faith in Inzamam was a masterstroke. Rameez Raja who played in that game and made 44 opening the batting was full of praise for Inzy's batting. "The spark was provided by Inzi, who played the innings of a lifetime, and Javed was the calming partner in that match-winning partnership." Ken Rutherford was awestruck by the impact that Inzamam had on the game. "A lot's been said about the tactics in the field, but I don't go along with that. No one could have foreseen the impact Inzamam would have."Still a lot had to be done to beat New Zealand who had made 262 on a slow surface at the Eden Park in Auckland. Pakistan needed 123 runs in 90 balls when Inzy strode out. His batting form had been poor till then and even Javed Miandad thought he didn't deserve a spot in the team. The critics were out to get him if he failed. Then Inzamam showed his class and maturity as he played one of the all-time great match-turning innings in a high pressure situation. His 37-ball 60 took Pakistan over the winning line. Ironically it was Javed who was with him at the other end as he smashed the Kiwi bowlers all around Eden Park.Legend has it that Inzamam pleaded with Imran to drop him from the team for the semi-final as he had taken ill, but Imran stood firm. Inzy had taken sleeping pills to calm himself before the big semi-final and that move backfired on him. According to ICC-Cricket - "A sleepless night with regular visits to the washroom left him ill and he announced himself unfit on the morning of the match. But Imran, first by himself and then through Aaqib Javed and Mushtaq Ahmed, convinced Inzamam to take the field and bat even if he had to do it in a "wheelchair"."But Pakistan won all three and booked a spot in the semis. There they took on New Zealand and the inspirational leadership of Imran came to the fore again. Young Inzamam was a special talent. Imran knew it. And he believed in him. Inzamam had just 123 runs in eight league games but Imran still believed in him. Any other captain would've dropped a player for such a poor run. But Imran wasn't any other captain. He had the knack of spotting talent and backing them to the hilt. Imran could've taken the easy route and played another batsman in Inzy's spot. He didn't.Pakistan's 1992 campaign got off to a miserable start when they were thumped by West Indies, who won by 10 wickets. Then at Adelaide, they were bowled out for 74 and looked set for a thrashing. But rain came to their rescue and gave them a point - which eventually proved vital as that point took them to the semis. A deflating loss to India was followed by another loss to South Africa. Pakistan's points table showed - played 5, won 1, lost 3, NR 1. There were three more games remaining and all were must-win. It wasn't easy clashes as well. Against Australia, Sri Lanka and high-flying New Zealand.So on that note, we welcome everyone to our live coverage of this big quarter-final between Australia and Pakistan being played at the Adelaide Oval. It is time to reminisce and refresh our memories a little bit as we have plenty of time for the game to begin. So let's continue our build-up for the game by focussing on Pakistan's greatest moment. We have started with Imran and it would only be apt to focus on what happened after 1987. So sit back and enjoy all that we bring you.Fast forward to the 1992 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand. Imran was 39 at that time and clearly looked half the player he was. He had lost all his pace and just was a medium-pace trundler in the Mudassar Nazar and Mohinder Amarnath mould. He was a liability in the field. But he could still bat and more importantly, captain and lead his men. He could inspire his troops. That is why he opted for one final hurrah. So will the dream finally come true? Or was it just a bad move to bring Imran back?So how would Imran be remembered? As one of Pakistan's greatest cricketers and captains ever or will he be judged based on his failure to win a World Cup for his country? A World Cup winning medal around the neck is what completes a cricketer's career. Imran knew that. Due to popular demand and with a burning desire to give it one more shot, he reversed his retirement decision and decided to come back again. Credit to the then President of Pakistan, Zia-ul-Haq who requested Imran to come back and lead the team again.Everyone were anticipating and expecting an India-Pakistan final at the iconic Eden Gardens. Why? Because India were playing England in the other semi-final and the dream final was India-Pakistan. It was not to be. Eventually it turned out to be an Australia-England final. So one of cricket's greatest all-rounders and most charismatic captains ever, Imran Khan had to finish like this. His great rival and friend from across the border, Kapil Dev had led India to glory in 1983. Imran had failed to do so. It must have hurt. Really hurt. They say there are no fairytale endings in sport. This seemed to cater to that logic.12:00 Local Time, 01:30 GMT, 07:00 IST: A nation's dreams dashed! A dashing general's last hurrah. The end of an era. The charismatic captain and leader of men - Imran Khan would bow out of the world stage in front of his adoring countrymen. The script wasn't written like this. It wasn't destined to end this way. But on 4th November, 1987, at a packed Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, in a World Cup semi-final, Imran Khan stood a defeated man. His side had been firm favorites going up against Australia, but Pakistan choked when it mattered the most and lost. That Pakistan side had Rameez Raja, Saleem Malik, Imran himself, Javed Miandad, a young Wasim Akram, and Abdul Qadir, along with a few upcoming stars. The favorites tag had placed too much pressure and they crumbled.Preview by G RajaramanAustralia will start favourite to win their ICC Cricket World Cup quarterfinal against Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval on Friday not only because they have the team with the better all-round strength but also because there is a hint of fragility about the batting unit in Misbah-ul-Haq's team. Curiously, Australia captain Michael Clarke expects a wonderful, entertaining game.Yet, Australia captain Michael Clarke, thought to be beleaguered at the start of the World Cup because of his runs-in with selectors and Cricket Australia officials but seeming to be well in control of the leadership, said his team will have to play their best cricket on Friday to beat Pakistan. "I don't think you're ever owed anything in this game of cricket," he said."It's been a long tournament. It's been a really good tournament for the game of cricket. I think everybody's at a stage now where it's been building and building and everybody's really excited that we're finally here. Your No. 1 goal is to make it to the quarterfinals. When you get here, you look forward to that big stage and playing against the best," Clarke said."I think Pakistan have been underrated for a long time, especially in the shorter form of the game. I think they've got a lot of talent. I think they're attack is very good and they've shown that throughout this series. I think they've got a good mix of youth and experience and their batting really well, and they're led well from Misbah," Clarke said.With a batting unit that includes explosive openers David Warner and Aaron Finch, the incredibly talented Steve Smith, Clarke himself and allrounders Shane Watson and Glenn Maxwell, Australia can be expected to handle the challenge of the Pakistan pace bowlers, led by Wahab Riaz, who has surprised out many batsmen with his pace and skiddy bounce.Even though left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson has not been their spearhead ? ceding that spot to the deadly Mitchell Starc ? Australia have the attack to keep the Pakistan batsmen in check. Sarfraz Ahmed has infused vim and vigour in the Pakistan batting but, as skipper Misbah-ul-Haq pointed out, it is important for them to not lose too many wickets at the start.Misbah also said his team believed in itself, drawing strength from the fact that favourites do not always have to win games. "The team that performs better on a day, has better chances, better luck, can really defeat any team. We are hopeful and very positive. I think we've got a bowling line-up which can really go through any team, and a few batters just getting back into form. This is only a matter of just putting a good show on that day," he said.Yet, viewed dispassionately, Australia will have to contribute to their own downfall but by the looks of it, Clarke's team is not ready to drop its intensity yet. "Tomorrow will be a tough challenge and I believe we have to be at our best to beat them," Clarke reiterated but Pakistan will have to find a magical batting show to stop Australia from going to the Sydney.
