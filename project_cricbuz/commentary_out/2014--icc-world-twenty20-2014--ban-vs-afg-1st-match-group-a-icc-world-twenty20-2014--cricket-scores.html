He has a few words to say to the keeper.The Bangladeshi openers make their way out to the middle.Razzak: "The wicket was helping us. There was a little bit of turn. I tried to bowl in the right areas and the wickets came easily. We weren't under pressure. We are looking forward to do well. We still have to chase this down. Anything can happen. We will just go and bat."There was nothing that Afghanistan could be proud of in their innings. Right from the first ball, when Shahzad mishit one to get out, to the last dismissal where Shapoor slogged and missed one, Afghanistan didn't do anything right. The shot selection was absolutely poor but let's not take any credit away from the Bangladeshi bowlers. Shakib started it all with two wickets in two ball and the Afghans couldn't recover since then. He got good support from the other spinners and in the end, a collective effort from the bowlers meant that they gave their batsmen very less to chase down. This should be easily done. Join us back for the run chase in a short while.1
