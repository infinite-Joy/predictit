N Kulasekara will open the attackA nightmarish batting display from Sri Lanka as they crashed to their lowest total against England in ODIs. But take no credit from the English bowlers, who exploited the conditions efficiently. Jimmy Anderson set the ball rolling before Jordon lit up a show. They were backed up by some agile fielding as well. Join us in a few minutes for England's reply, which should be a mere formality.2
SRI LANKA:23.6 Jordan to Malinga, out Lbw!! 5-fer for Jordon. He is mobbed by his team-mates. Sri Lanka have been wiped out for 67. Jordon fittingly leads the English team off the field, pointing the ball upwards, soaking the applause from the crowd, ala Glenn McGrath. This was full and skidding on, Malinga sits back and misses the attempted defence. The ball would have gone on to hit the leg-stump. The tracker confirms it as well.

This was very full and pushed across, inviting Mathews to drive. He plays at it loosely, the ball carries through to the keeper. The on-field umpire gives it OUT. Mathews challenges the decision. There was a tiny deflection on the real time snicko. That is good enough for the original call to be upheld and with it Sri Lanka's chances of a recovery take another beating, Mathews has to go back to the hut. Mathews c Buttler b Jordan 11(12) [4s-2]Jordan to Mathews, THATS OUT!! Caught!!A shout for caught behind.. The umpire raises his finger. Mathews wants a referral.

The forecast doesn't look great. We can't control it. We are playing another spinner. Herath is back in place of Dhammika Prasad. Ajantha misses out but we have a good bowling line up."Cook: "We are going to have a bowl first. It was a poor performance in the last game. It was frustrating after winning at the Oval. We are playing the same team apart from me coming in for Carbs."England have won the toss and have opted to fieldAlastair Cook is back to lead the hosts after missing England's heaviest loss, in terms of runs at home.13:45 Local Time, 12:45 GMT, 18:15 IST: Some good news. The coin will go up at 13:50 Local Time. The game will kick off at 14:20. We will have a full game. No overs have been docked.13:40 Local Time, 12:40 GMT, 18:40 IST: No news about the inspection yet. The clean-up operations are still going on.13:25 Local Time, 12:25 GMT, 17:55 IST: It is not raining at the moment. The players are practising on the outfield..Machester has experienced plenty of rain since morning. The ground-staff are in the middle of a mopping operation now. The official news is that a pitch inspection will take place at 13:30 Local Time. The forecast for the remainder of the day does not seem very promising either. Do stay with us for further updates..Sri Lanka though will be buoyed with their all-round display amid unfamiliar conditions. Dilshan is back amongst the runs, Priyanjan seems a bright prospect, Sena and Kula have let it rip with the ball.Eoin Morgan has urged the English to 'up their game' to boost the chances of a series win and with it re-earn the trust of their fans. They have been tight-lipped about Captain Cook's fitness status.The very next game after lifting their fans with a comfortable win, England stretched back to the stragglers again, getting bundled out for a cheap 99..PreviewAfter the drubbing they got at the hands of Sri Lanka in the 2nd ODI, England would want to start afresh in the third ODI. After a superb show in the 1st ODI, England crashed to their lowest total at home against Sri Lanka after being bundled out for a paltry 99 in pursuit of 257. All their batters, barring Eoin Morgan fell to some superb bowling by the Sri Lankans. The conditions were overcast and after opting to bowl first, the English bowlers disappointed by spraying the ball around during the initial spell. The Sri Lankan seam bowlers used the conditions perfectly and led by Nuwan Kulasekara they bundled out the hosts for a paltry score. The forecast for the third ODI isn't great with AccuWeather predicting loads of rain for Manchester on Wednesday during the day. Some of it should clear towards the evening, but it looks like it might be one of those stop-start days.England:Their team looked settled during the 1st ODI, but they had a bad day at office during the 2nd ODI. They have had two days to recover from the drubbing and are still contemplating over the fitness of their captain Alastair Cook, who was ruled out of a groin injury in the second ODI. Morgan was honest in his post-match presentation, where he admitted that it was one of the worst performance he had ever been part of. Their bowling also lacked depth as they leaked too many runs at the death and helped Sri Lanka cross the 250-run mark. Chris Jordan, who starred with an all-round performance in the 1st ODI, couldn't repeat his fine performance and ended up with figures of 1/56. Only two batsmen crossed the double figure mark, with only Morgan scoring more than 12 runs. Sri Lanka:After coming up with a dismal performance in the 1st ODI, they came back well to level the series 1-1 in the 2nd ODI. Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and Ashan Priyanjan had a good match, but Lahiru Thirimanne's form has been a worry for them as he has not fired in the 2 matches so far. Dilshan missed out on a well deserved hundred, while Sanga played well under overcast conditions and along with Dilshan added crucial 96 runs for the second wicket which consolidated SL after they had lost an early wicket. Priyanjan and Angelo Mathews provided the late assault and helped Sri Lanka post a competitive total. Their bowling also looks impressive at the moment, with Kulasekara swinging the ball both ways at the start. Malinga has been expensive during the 1st two matches and he will look to improve on that. Senanayake was superb in the 2nd ODI, where he troubled the England batsmen with his guile and flight. Even though they won the 2nd match convincingly, they were far from their usual self. Suranga Lakmal has been ruled out of the entire ODI series after sustaining a grade-two hamstring tear in the first ODI. Rangana Herath has been drafted into the side as his replacement and it has boosted their bowling line-up.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith Malinga, Dhammika Prasad, Chaturanga de Silva, Ajantha Mendis, Ashan Priyanjan, Kushal Janith Perera, Rangana HerathEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, James Anderson, Harry Gurney, Chris Woakes, Michael Carberry, Alex HalesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
