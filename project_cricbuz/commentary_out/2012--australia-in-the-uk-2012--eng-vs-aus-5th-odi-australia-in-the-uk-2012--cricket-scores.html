Watson and Lee miss out, owing to injuries.England are going into this game with two spinners. Bresnan sits out and Tredwell gets the nod. With all the rain, the spinners might actually have a tough time gripping the ball and getting it to turn on a damp wicket might be diffcult as well.England have won the toss and elected to field9:15 PM IST: The players are warming up in the outfield but the rain seems to have come back again.8:35 PM IST: The news from the ground is that the game will start at 5:30 PM local and we will have 32 overs a side. That's another one and a half hours from now, might even have a little rain in the middle. This is what Dean Wilson has to offer on twitter: 32 overs per side - shorter game gives Australia a better chance. Powerplays - 7, 3 bat and 3 bowl. Bowlers x2 get 7 overs and x3 get 68:30 PM IST: The inspection will take place shortly but it seems as though the rain has come back just when it should have stayed away.

The ground staff will need at least three hours to get the ground fit for play.Welcome to the 5th and final ODI between England and Australia. For the visitors this game is a dead rubber with the series already in England's hands. Australia might look for some motivation but they will certainly not get any by looking at the skies. The weather has been gloomy all day in Manchester and with the amount of rain that the ground has received over the past two days, we might have more of a chance of witnessing a game at the Old Trafford football stadium.Preview by GaneshPride. That is what Australia will be playing for in this dead rubber. Never have Australia been so convincingly outplayed in an ODI series against England. It evoked an angry and desperate response from coach Mickey Arthur, as he called for his team to show more 'mongrel' out in the middle. Injuries to key players are not helping their cause either.Australia:The odds have piled up against Michael Clarke's men. They desperately need someone to inspire them. David Warner has shown that he could provide them that upfront but he's facing a tough time against arguably the best bowling attack in the world today. Despite missing a few frontline bowlers, England boast of an attack that could match or even outbowl many other countries' first string bowlers. In the absence of the experienced Michael Hussey, Australia have been like fish out of the water. Shane Watson and Brett Lee, two of Clarke's senior aides have returned home due to injuries leaving Australia with more worries. When searched thoroughly, Australia could find a few bright spots from the tour, like the bowling of Clint Mckay, but these have been very dim so far and fades away when one takes a look at the manner in which Australia have been pounded.The fact that they have lost the series already could in fact turn out to be a blessing in disguise for it could free the minds' of some. MAtthew Wade will have an excellent opportunity to showcase his talent at the top of the order and he sould be desperate to make the most of it.England:They might lack the batting flair that some other countries possess but there will be no one questioning their attitiude or hunger. England have been clinical and brutally efficient with everything they have done so far in the series. For a nation known to scoff at the shorter formats of the game, this has been a rather emphatic statement from the players and the team management on the way forward for the team. They have not shied away from the fact that they are yearning to be the No 1 side in ODIs too to be on level with where they stand in Tests and T20Is (according to the rankings). Alastair Cook will be a mighty relieved man for England seem to have hardly felt the bite of losing someone as talented as Kevin Pietersen just ahead of the series.A lot has been said about the bowling group already and this could be a chance for someone from the second rung to push his stocks further up. Whichever way they chose to go, England have already made one thing quite clear. They have a fixed vision for the future and nothing less than a clean sweep would appease them.Quotes:Four-nil looks a lot better than 3-1.
