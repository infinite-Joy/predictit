Woakes will start the proceedings with two slips in placeTeams:England (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Moeen Ali, Alex Hales, Joe Root, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, Harry GurneySri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Jeevan Mendis, Dilruwan Perera, Suranga LakmalAlastair Cook: "Looks like a good wicket. So does not matter what we do. 4-3 sounds a lot better than 5-2, so we would like to finish on a winning note. It is always a huge honour to play for the country and today is no different. We have two changes - Hales and Gurney are back in. We would like everyone to get a chance."Angelo Mathews: "We will have a bat first. Looks like a good wicket. It won't turn much so we would like to put runs on board. Thankful to Sanga and Mahela. They have always given the best to the team. We want them to go on a high. One change for us - Dilruwan Perera comes in for Senanayake."England make two changes - Hales and Gurney back in, for Bopara and Finn. One change for Sri Lanka, Dilruwan for injured Senanayake.Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batThere is no reserve day for today's ODI. However, it is bright and sunny. It looks promising weather-wise and we will bring you the toss and teams in a few minutes.On the other hand, England have had another disappointing series. Nothing is going right for Alastair Cook. His poor batting form continues and he has hardly been able to inspire the team to do better. Joe Root and Moeen Ali have done well but most of the players have been inconsistent. In comparison, though their bowlers have been better, they have done little to trouble the strong Sri Lankan batting line-up.Sri Lanka have put hardly a foot wrong in the series so far. Their middle-order has been in top-notch form, especially Kumar Sangakkara, who is just 79 runs short of amassing 500 runs in the series. Their openers have got fantastic starts but have not been able to capitalize on that. Their bowling has been decent and the pacers have used the conditions pretty well. With less than two months to go for the World Cup, the hosts would hope to iron out these problems pretty soon.Sri Lanka have already won the ODI series, having emerged victorious in four games out of the six played so far. Today, they will be gearing up to bid adieu to their favourites Sangakkara and Mahela, who will take the field for the final time at home. A bumper crowd is expected at Premadasa and the hosts would like nothing more than to end this 7-match ODI series on a high.Preview:Having already clinched the series in the 6th ODI, Sri Lanka will be eager to end the series on winning note when they face England in the seventh and final ODI at the R Premadasa stadium in Colombo. Although it is a dead rubber, the match will hold a lot of significance for the hosts as this will be the final time Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara take the field in an ODI game at home. Sri Lanka will be hoping to make it a memorable farewell for the legends while England will be eager to salvage some pride in what has been yet another below-par series for them.Sri Lanka:Sri Lanka's batting has been well-served by Sangakkara, who has been notching up one big score after another and is just 79 runs short of 500 in this series. With one hundred and four fifties in six games, Sangakkara has been in top form and Sri Lanka will be hoping that he continues in the same vein. With two half-centuries apiece, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Jayawardene have done well while Angelo Mathews and Lahiru Thirimanne have also been useful down the order. However, the batting order, apart from Sangakkara, has not shown the kind of consistency Sri Lanka would have hoped for. Sri Lanka will be eager to sort these out with less than two months to go for the World Cup.Most of the Lankan bowlers have been amongst the wickets but few of them have been on the expensive side. Dhammika Prasad has not been at his best, going at close to 7-an-over while Ajantha Mendis, despite picking up 9 wickets so far, has been leaking runs. Suranga Lakmal, who returned to the Lankan side, came up with a fine spell in the previous match, picking up with a four-wicket haul. Sachitra Senanayake, since his return to international cricket, has also been impressive. Rangana Herath too has done a decent job in this series while Dilshan's contributions with the ball have been an added bonus for the Lankans. What the hosts will prefer is for the bowlers to be more disciplined.England:Alastair Cook, at the helm of affairs, has had a disappointing series as his poor run with the bat in ODIs has continued. With just 87 runs in 5 matches at an average of 17.40, the England skipper's position in the team has been frequently questioned although coach, Peter Moores, still believes that he is the right man for the job. Ian Bell, who got to play only two matches, was also average with the bat, managing just 46 runs. Ravi Bopara started the series well with consecutive fifties in the first two games. He, however, failed to come good after that. Joe Root and Moeen Ali, with a hundred and a fifty each against their names, have been the best performers for England in this series, along with James Taylor, who impressed all with his 90 and 68 in the 4th and 5th ODIs. England need more runs from the top-order batsmen, starting with skipper Cook, and they need to score well as consistently as possible in order to stand a chance in the upcoming ICC Cricket World Cup next year.Chris Woakes, who picked up a six-wicket haul in the 5th ODI, is England's top-wicket taker in the series with 14 scalps, but has has also been giving away a few runs. Chris Jordan too has been amongst the wickets, although he too has leaked runs. In fact, amongst the nine bowlers that England have used so far, James Tredwell is the only one with an economy rate of less than 5-an-over while Ben Stokes and Harry Gurney have been the most expensive, with the latter having an economy of more than 10. England's bowling has been decent but they have not done much to bother the Sri Lankan batsmen.Numbers:90: The number of runs Kumar Sangakkara needs to dethrone Sanath Jayasuriya from the third spot on the list of highest run-getters in ODIs. Sangakkara presently has scored 13,339 runs.79: The number of runs Kumar Sangakkara requires to become the first player to score 500 runs in a bilateral ODI series. Rohit Sharma, who scored 491 runs in the series against Australia in 2013, tops the list.1: The number of fifty+ scores for Alastair Cook in 2014. He has played 19 innings so far this year and has scored just 491 runs at an average of 27.27.Weather:A curtailed day is a possibility as rain is forecast in the evening and late night. With no reserve day for the final ODI, weather might play spoil-sport to Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara's home farewell.Quotes:He is working extremely hard to get his own form right and also do the other thing that captains have to do, try and create a platform for people to play well: England coach, Peter Moores, still has faith in Alastair Cook.It's about the right time to go and now is the right time to go. Even though we sign agreements with Sri Lanka Cricket, our real agreement is with Sri Lankan fans, and we all play for them: Kumar Sangakkara gets emotional.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Joe Root, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, Steven Finn, Harry Gurney, Ben Stokes, Alex Hales, Ian BellSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Seekkuge Prasanna, Sachithra Senanayake, Suranga Lakmal, Shaminda Eranga, Lakshan Rangika, Dilruwan Perera, Dhammika Prasad, Thilina KandambyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
