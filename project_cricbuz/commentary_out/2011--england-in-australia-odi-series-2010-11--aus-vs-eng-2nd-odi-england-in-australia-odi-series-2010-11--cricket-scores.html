Let's find out how the Aussies go about their bowling.Shahzad got England off to a brilliant start with quick wickets as the Aussie top order failed collectively before Marsh notched up a brilliant century, ably aided by White at first and then Bollinger, to lead the Aussie fightback. Wickets fell at regular intervals thereafter but the late flourish allowed them to get to a competitive score. It is still not a huge score and would be interesting to see how the English apply themselves when they go about the chase. Join us shortly for the same. 4
