Johnson will open the attackWelcome back for the run-chase.. The players are out in the middle and Johnson will start off proceedings..As for the Australian batting, it was only Mitchell Marsh who was able to counter the pace and bounce of the South African bowlers. He applied himself and scored a fighting fifty to take his side to a respectable total. The home side will have to bowl exceedingly well if they have to defend this as the lowest total to be defended on this ground is 162. Will it be a walk in the park for South Africa? Or will Australia make life difficult for the visitors? Join us in a short while to find out...It has been the Morne Morkel show! The South Africans have adapted very quickly to the bouncy Perth wicket. They started proceedings with Morkel, who struck in his first over. Since then, the Aussies never seem to get a hold of the game. Morne was hostile as he wrecked havoc among the Australian batsman, he ended with a 5-wicket haul. Philander and Steyn supported him well as the duo shared 4 wickets between them.4
