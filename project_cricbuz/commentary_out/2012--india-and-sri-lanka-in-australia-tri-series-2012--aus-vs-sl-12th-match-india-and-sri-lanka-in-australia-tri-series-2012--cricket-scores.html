AUSTRALIA:49.1 49.1 Nuwan Kulasekara to David Hussey, out Caught by Dilshan!! That's it. Sri Lanka progress through to the final. It was a half volley, in the slot outside off. David Hussey goes for the loft, ends up hitting it straight to long off. Dilshan takes a good catch. Kulasekara falls on his back on the pitch and exults. Jayawardene is ecstatic. Hussey, well he will be distraught. David Hussey c Dilshan b Nuwan Kulasekara 74(74) [4s-4 6s-1] Nuwan Kulasekara to David Hussey, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Nuwan Kulasekara [9.0-1-38-1] is back into the attackTen runs off the last over. Kulasekara to bowl. Knowing David Hussey, it should not be a difficult task for him. He should be backing himself. These are the kind of situations which separate the good from the Great. Deep backward square leg, deep midwicket, long on and long off are the fielders in the deep. Third man inside the circle. My guess: The ball angling in.
AUSTRALIA:48.6  Malinga to Hilfenhaus, no run, Hussey will be on strike for the last over. Yorker length delivery outside off, Hilfenhaus looks to defend and predictably, misses.

AUSTRALIA:48.2  Malinga to Doherty, out Caught by Dilshan!! Malinga has done it with a slower ball. But the important question is, has Hussey crossed??? Slower delivery outside off, Doherty is early into the shot, lobs up the ball in the air. Dilshan runs from mid on, calls out 'Mine' and takes an easy catch. One wicket to go, 13 to get. Like Bill Lawry would say, It's all happening here at the MCG. Doherty c Dilshan b Malinga 7(15) Malinga to Doherty, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Can Doherty take a single? Or will his stumps be disturbed?

Hosts Australia take on Sri Lanka in the 12th league match today and for the visitors, it is a simple equation :- Win the match and progress to the finals. However if they lose, their geographical neighbours, India will play the hosts in the three match finals. Stay tuned for the toss and pitch report.Preview by Karthik LakshmananThe final league match of the CB series - Australia vs Sri Lanka - was supposed to be a dead rubber and a practice game for the finals, but a stunning innings from Virat Kohli in the previous game has given this match a new context. The result of the game will decide which team will fight with Australia for the trophy in the 3 match finals. A win for Sri Lanka (or even a tie/wash-out) will take them through to the finals, while a loss for them will make it an Australia vs India final. Sri Lanka: Australia may have been the first team to qualify for the finals but it would be fair to say that Sri Lanka have been the best team of the tournament so far. After a couple of early losses, they bounced back and remained unbeaten in the next four, and it required a super-human effort from a resurgant Indian batting line up to break their momentum. That knock may prove to be too costly for Sri Lanka, as they suddenly find themselves in a must win situation. Sri Lanka may be a bit jolted, but the good thing for them is that they have got the better of Australia twice already in this series. Even though their bowlers had an off day against India, their batsmen continued to show good form. Sri Lanka will particularly be happy with their senior batsmen Dilshan and Sangakkara, who converted their starts into centuries in the previous game. The bad news for Sri Lanka is that their all-rounder Farveez Maharoof has been ruled out of the match due a back injury. Maharoof's all-round abilities lends balance to the Sri Lankan team, and his absence will force a change in the team composition for the first time after 4 matches. The rest of the bowling line up is likely to remain the same despite a poor game against India. Sri Lanka, under a new captain, have made big strides in this series with consistent performances, and will have to finish well. A return to home as the third best team will undo all the good work done in the last few weeks.Australia: It is much more than a practice game for Australia. They started the series with a couple of victories but have struggled for consistency ever since. A loss at Melbourne will make it 3 in a row for Sri Lanka against Australia, which will be a massive mental advantage going into the finals. Australia's top order has been consistently shaky in the series, making the batting line up heavily dependent on the middle order. Warner, who was under scanner after failing consistently in the series, got some runs under his belt in the previous game against India, and Australia will hope that he makes it count in the upcoming games. Regular captain Michael Clarke may not take field again, as doubts over his fitness continue to linger. It means that Shane Watson, who himself is making a comeback to the side, will be the captain for the second consecutive game. Australia will make some changes to the bowling line up. James Pattinson, who has been out of action after the Sydney Test against India, has recovered completely from his foot injury and has been picked in place of Ryan Harris. Brett Lee has also been playing with a broken foot but is expected to fight his injury and play on. Last word: It may be a dead rubber for one team, but it's a big game for the other 2 in the competition. There will be a lot of people following the game closely from the sub-continent. Sri Lankan fans will want their country to win, while Indian fans will pray for an Australian victory for the first time this summer.
