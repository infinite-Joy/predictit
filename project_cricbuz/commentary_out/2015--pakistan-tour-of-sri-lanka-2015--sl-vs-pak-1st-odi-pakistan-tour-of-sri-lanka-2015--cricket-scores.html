Azhar Ali is on strike. Malinga will open the attackWelcome back.. The Pakistani openers are out in the middle. Malinga has the new ball in his hands. Azhar Ali to take strike first up. Here we go...Almost all the Sri Lankan batsmen got starts, but none could convert them into a substantial score. The top-5 batters all got to 20 or more but it was their No. 6, Dinesh Chandimal, who got to a fifty. He along with debutant, Milinda Siriwardana added a few useful runs to boost the final total. The visitors should fancy their chances of chasing down this total. Will they be able to do so? Or will Malinga and Co. run through the side? Join us back in a short while to find out...Pakistan would be the happier side going into the break. Azhar Ali called the toss right and inserted the hosts in.

It depends on the situation, wherever the team needs me, I will bat there."Azhar Ali: 'There will be some help early on, we want to bowl first.
