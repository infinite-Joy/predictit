AFGHANISTAN:17.1 Clarke to Shenwari, 1 run, flatter and on the stumps, back foot drive towards long-on for a singleAhmadi followed his partner back to the pavilion. He looked to guide Hazlewood over the slip cordon and was caught by Clarke. That dismissal just indicates Afghanistan's batsmen lack the experience, as on a wicket that offers pace and bounce, looking to guide it over the slip cordon is a high-risk shot. To make it worse for Afghanistan, Asghar Stanikzai, one of the better players in their camp, threw his wicket away with a wild slog, as Johnson picked up his second wicket. Nawroz Mangal, with his pyrotechnics, then hoicked Mitchell Marsh for a couple of sixes. Undoubtedly, Afghanistan need Mangal to compile a fine knock to take them to a total of some respectability.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: Mitchell Starc bowled with scorching pace, swung the new ball and extracted bounce. His new ball partner, Josh Hazlewood, too produced bounce though, he struggled with his line. However, to the credit of Afghanistan's openers, they tried to play late and left the ball rather well. As the openers were showing decent technique and application, Michael Clarke introduced Mitchell Johnson into the attack, and he took the first wicket by dismissing Usman Ghani. It was not a bad shot by Ghani, but unfortunately for him, he hit it straight to James Faulkner, fielding at straightish mid-wicket.Drinks are on the field now

Ahmadi is on strike. Starc will open the attackTwo slips and a short-leg in place as Starc steams inWelcome back.. 18-year-old Usman Ghani is making his WC debut, not ideal - facing Johnson and Starc at the WACA. But that's how things go.Smith: "For us it was just about batting and getting a good score on the board. It was nice to spend some time in the middle there. It was pretty easy out there with Davey at the other end. It was pretty hot out there early on but it cooled down later on with the breeze. When you get 400 on the board, you always feel confident. Hopefully we can bowl well and make it a comprehensive win."For Afghanistan, Dawlat gave a good account of himself with the new ball by pitching it up though, he came in for some severe punishment in the end overs. Other seamers weren't up to the mark either. It was also interesting to see that Afghanistan's off-spinners didn't use the arm ball extensively. With the south-west breeze coming into play, an off-spinner can get it to hold it up in the air. Afghanistan perhaps would rue the fact that they decided to bowl first. It also has to be said that Afghanistan's fielding was average. Now, they have the uphill task of facing up to a fine Australian pace attack. Once Warner was dismissed, Maxwell with his brilliance stunned the opposition into silence as well. Afghanistan didn't help their cause by bowling a slew of full tosses and Maxwell took heavy toll of it. To their credit, the seamers looked to bowl the yorker, but as soon as they missed it, Maxwell would hoick it across the line. He then, started to toy with the lengths of Afghanistan's pacers, and played a jaw-dropping reverse sweep and it turned out to be a six. In fact, Maxwell smashed a crunching fifty in just 21 balls. It was the joint third fastest fifty in World Cups. Unfortunately for Afghanistan, it continued to rain fours and sixes from Maxwell's willow and when Shapoor bowled one on the pads, with a mere flick of the wrists, he clobbered it for six. In all this mayhem, one has to also remember that Smith played with a mature head on his shoulders to compile a fine knock of 95.It was an innings, where Warner took full advantage of anything that was banged in short and when the seamers bowled a fuller length, he hammered it down the ground. In short, Warner made what seemed like a decent pace attack on paper look utterly pedestrian. After Dawlat Zadran generated a bit of swing and snared the wicket of Aaron Finch, Warner took over by mercilessly thwacking Afghanistan's seamers. Hamid Hassan, who tested the middle of the pitch, was duly punished by Warner as he used the cut and the pull to good effect. Once Warner reached his century, with his breathtaking fluency, he floored the opposition ranks into submission. He smashed Dawlat and his new ball partner, Shapoor Zadran, for fours and sixes. In particular, the way he thumped a half volley off Shapoor's bowling over the long-on region for a six in the 32nd over of the innings, gave a glimpse of his exceptional bat-speed.David Warner, with a volley of stunning strokes, blazed his way to compose a wondrous innings of 178 in a mere 133 balls and helped Australia to reach a monstrous score on the board. Glenn Maxwell too with his majestic brilliance amassed a magnificent knock. Warner's innings turned out to be the highest individual score by an Australian in World Cups. He and Steven Smith also stitched the highest partnership for any wicket for Australia in ODIs. To put the icing on the cake, Australia's total of 417 for 6 is now the highest score in World Cups.4

AUSTRALIA:37.3 Shapoor to Warner, out Caught by Nabi!! That is an excellent catch by the Afghanistan skipper. Davey Warner walks off to a standing ovation. He had the opportunity to score a double-hundred today, but he's missed out. Full and on the off stump, normally Warner would have muscled that over the boundary, this time the bat turns in his hands on impact with the ball and goes straight up in the air, mid-wicket runs to his right and reverse-cups the ball. Warner backed away to go big, but he couldn't get the middle of the bat. End of a terrific knock from the left-hander. Warner c Nabi b Shapoor 178(133) [4s-19 6s-5]Shapoor to Warner, THATS OUT!!

AUSTRALIA:34.4 Hamid to S Smith, no run, another fantastic yorker from Hamid, Smith was beaten for pace and the late reverse swing back into the right-hander foxed the batsman as well. The ball sneaked under Smith's bat as he tried to jam it out. In fact, it was bowled at 146kph

AUSTRALIA:33.1 Shapoor to S Smith, 1 run, Shapoor starts from round the wicket, Smith drives the yorker length ball to sweeper coverTanmoy adds this from the ground - There's a real buzz at the WACA now, this is Australia's only game on this ground. He feels that the kid is due an autograph from Warner after being battered by that ball which hit him on his handAustralia opt for the batting powerplayFor Australia, Warner continued to play with a dash of fearlessness and essayed a crunching ton. Once he reached his hundred, he clobbered Dawlat for two sixes and two fours in a single over. He also essayed a volley of thunderous strokes to thrash Shapoor Zadran for a four and a six in the 32nd over of the game. In short, Warner's bat-speed is phenomenal. On the other hand, after a quiet start, Smith used his supple wrists to good effect to collect runs square of the wicket on either side. Australia look set to amass a monstrous score on the board.In an attempt to slow the run rate down, Mohammad Nabi used the spinners. Nabi and Javed Ahmadi bowled a few tight overs, but Samiullah Shenwari, the leg-spinner, struggled to bowl with control. Unfortunately for Afghanistan, they missed the chance to run out Steven Smith and Afsar Zazai dropped a tough catch off Nabi's bowling to give Warner a reprieve. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 19 overs: After Dawlat Zadran bowled a fine spell with the new ball, Hamid Hassan looked to bang it short and paid the price, as he was thwacked to all corners of the ground, especially by David Warner.Drinks are on the field now

AUSTRALIA:14.1 Shenwari to Warner, no run, Shenwari starts with a full toss, punched back towards the bowlerSamiullah Shenwari, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackIt would be interesting to see how the pacers playing in this game adjust to the 'Fremantle Doctor'. It is an afternoon cooling sea breeze that regularly passes through the ground and assists the swing bowlers with their outswinger. However, pacers who aren't used to bowling into the wind tend to struggle while bowling from the Prindiville Stand end. Historically though, the likes of Ray Strauss and Terry Alderman have used it to great effect while playing for Western Australia. Interestingly, Ian Brayshaw used the easterly wind to take a 10-wicket haul for Western Australia against Victoria in 1967-68.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 14 overs: Shapoor Zadran and in particular, Dawlat Zadran, bowled a fuller length, and Dawlat was rewarded for his fine effort with the wicket of opener, Aaron Finch. Most of the bowlers tend to get carried away with the pace and bounce on offer at the WACA, but Dawlat and Shapoor looked to bring the batsmen forward. In fact, they just bowled one short delivery in the first nine overs of the innings. It was David Warner, who after a few nervous moments against the new ball decided to go after Afghanistan's seamers and succeeded by smashing a flurry of boundaries. He then, composed a sparkling fifty in just 40 deliveries and after a fine start, Afghanistan's pacers lost the plot.Drinks are on the field now. The break has been taken 3 minutes earlier than normal.

AUSTRALIA:2.6 Dawlat Zadran to Finch, out Caught by Nawroz!! There you go! This was coming. He plays with acres of space between bat and pad and perishes. Brilliant over from Dawlat Zadran. He offered no width to the batsman and forced Finch to play a false stroke. Full and just swinging away outside off stump, Finch looks to drive off the front foot, but the big bat-pad gap meant he was not in a good position. The ball takes a healthy outside edge and flies to first slip, who dives low to his left and takes a good catch. Dawlat is charged and pumps his fist on his chest. It's a wicket-maiden as well.

AUSTRALIA:1.4 Shapoor to Warner, 2 runs, inside edge and almost dragged-on. Hardly any feet movement from Warner as he tries to slash that through cover-point, the short of length delivery was a little too close to employ that shot and luckily for him it misses the stumps. The fielder at fine leg runs to his left and stops the ball with his bootShapoor slows down as he approaches the bowling crease. Maybe he lost his run-up.

AUSTRALIA:0.4 Dawlat Zadran to Warner, no run, nice inswinger just outside off stump, Warner covers the stumps and drives it watchfully off the front foot to mid-off
AUSTRALIA:0.3 Dawlat Zadran to Warner, no run, Warner was almost foxed on the pull shot. The length was short enough for Warner to rock back and try the shot, but it didn't bounce much, kept a bit low and took the inside half of the bat before rolling towards mid-on

Warner is on strike. Dawlat Zadran will open the attackTwo slips in place. Dharmasena says 'let's play' and here we go...The anthems are over and Afghanistan form a huddle. Australian openers Warner and Finch stride out. Warner marks his guard. Dawlat has the new ball in his hands.The teams are walking out for the national anthems. Afghanistan's anthem will be followed by Australia's "Advance Australia Fair."Pitch Report: "Beautiful blue sky, it will only get warmer. It's an absolute road, a beautiful batting surface, the ball will fly from the surface. Australia would love to bat first, the best chance for Afghanistan, with their pacers, is to bowl first and make the most of any early assistance from the pitch," reckons Shane WarneTeams:Australia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Michael Clarke(c), Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh HazlewoodAfghanistan (Playing XI): Javed Ahmadi, Usman Ghani, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai(w), Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor ZadranAfghanistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldNabi: "There is a little bit of moisture in the pitch. We want to use the conditions here and take early wickets and put them under pressure. We have one change, Usman Ghani is playing and Gulbadin Naib is not playing."Clarke: "I pulled up really well, obviously it's always great to be playing for Australia, so it's nice to be back out in the middle. We would have liked the win (against New Zealand), didn't go that way. We've got a big game today. The finisher (Faulkner) is back, the whole of Australia should be excited, we certainly are as a team. He's been a wonderful performer for a long period of time for us and he's an important part of this World Cup team, that's for sure. I think the wicket looks fantastic, the ground is in great nick. So had I won the toss, I would have batted. Hazlewood is back in for Cummins with his injury and Faulkner in for Watson. Big game for us we need to bounce back after the loss against New Zealand."The toss is not too far away. We saw a few days ago in the India-UAE game that the fast bowlers got enough purchase from the pitch as it offered a lot of pace and bounce; the spinners got a bit of drift as well. There is no doubt that Australia have the pace battery to do well if they opt to bowl, but with not much of batting so far in the tournament, they would want to bat first and get some runs under the belt before playing the big games. So it is going to be very interesting to see what the captains will do at the toss.Speaking ahead of the match, this is what captain Mohammad Nabi had to say. "We are not scared of them, but we respect them because they have good attacking bowlers and good quality batsmen and fielders as well." Meanwhile, assistant coach Peter Anderson said that the win against Scotland has given the team a lot of confidence. "We've come off a win against Scotland, so that's given the boys a lot of confidence. We know we're up against one of the best teams in the world and certainly arguably the best pace attack."Then came the game against Scotland. Having opted to field first, Afghanistan bowled well and restricted scotland to 210 in their 50 overs. In reply, despite getting off to a good start, Afghanistan lost 6 wickets for 47 runs and lost their way. However, a determined knock from Samiullah Shenwari (96) took them closer but Shenwari was dismissed with 19 runs required. With one wicket in hand, the last wicket pair of Hamid Hassan and Shapoor Zadran gave them a dramatic come-from-behind victory with 3 balls to spare.Moving focus to the other team, Afghanistan, who were pretty confident going into the their World Cup debut game against Bangladesh, lost the match by a big margin, despite bowling well for 30 odd overs. Even against Sri Lanka, Mohammad Nabi & Co. put on a spirited show and ran Sri Lanka very close, only to be denied a victory by a Mahela Jayawardene masterclass.Meanwhile, Australia have a few injury concerns ahead of this match. Pat Cummins was ruled out of this contest due to a minor side strain, while Steve Smith has been declared fit, despite taking a blow on his left hand while batting in the nets at the WACA. The good news though is that allrounder James Faulkner is back after recovering from a side strain which he sustained in the tri-series final against England on February 1.Speaking to a renowned Australian radio station after the match, Mitchell Johnson, who was thrashed by McCullum had this to say. "He's a great player. He took me apart, I haven't been belted like that for a long while. I just think we were probably a little bit nervous through that middle period. We trained and we knew what to expect. We knew the ball was going to swing there. We knew what to expect we just didn't play our game when we got out there in the middle. I think the moment probably got a bit big for us."Opting to bat first, Australia got off to a good start, but Trent Boult's five-wicket haul completely blew them away as they lost 8 wickets in a space of 26 runs at one stage, before being bowled out for 151. In reply, Brendon McCullum went bang, bang, bang up the order and registered a breezy fifty, but once he was dismissed, Mitchell Starc rocked the middle and lower middle order with a 6-fer and reduced them to 146/9. With 6 runs needed, Kane Williamson, who came in at No. 3, held his nerve and hit a marvellous six to deny Australia a thrilling victory.Australia began the tournament with a bang registering a thumping win over England, but the rained-out match against Bangladesh has cost them a point when they were expected to win that contest in Brisbane. Although it is highly unlikely that one point will deny them a place in the quarterfinals, it has put them in a slightly tricky situation. Their next game against New Zealand was a cracker.We are back to 'The Furnace' for this Pool A encounter between World Cup co-hosts Australia and Afghanistan. Michael Clarke & Co. will be keen to register a big win today and better their net run rate as it could prove crucial later in the tournament. On the other hand, Afghanistan will be upbeat going into the contest, having registered their first ever World Cup win over Scotland. Although Australia are clear favourites to win this game, it will be very interesting to see Afghanistan's approach as they have the bowling to exploit the pace and bounce on offer at the WACA. Before we go any further, let's take a close look at the teams.Teams:Afghanistan (From): Javed Ahmadi, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai(k), Gulbadin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor Zadran, Usman Ghani, Shafiqullah Shafiq, Aftab Alam, Nasir JamalAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke(c), Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin(k), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, James Faulkner, George Bailey, Xavier DohertyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
