INDIA:15.3 15.3Riaz to Dhoni, FOUR, and he doesn't miss out. So India record their 5th win in 7 games over Pakistan in T20Is. It's two-in-two for them in this Asia Cup. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Dhoni cracks it hard off the back foot and it rockets past the man at cover for fourThe crowd goes, "Dhoni, Dhoni, Dhoni." Another chance for the Indian skipper to finish off the game.
INDIA:15.2 Riaz to Yuvraj, leg byes, 1 run, similar line from Riaz, Yuvraj misses the flick, rolls into the on-side off the thigh pad

INDIA:14.6 Sami to Yuvraj, 1 run, shortish delivery on the leg stump, Yuvraj moves across the sticks and works it behind square on the on-side
INDIA:14.5 Sami to Dhoni, 3 runs, a back foot punch from Dhoni, looked like a dot ball as it went towards cover, the fielder makes a mess of it on the dive, it escapes, Dhoni was slow for the first run, then realised that it wasn't going for four, took off, called Yuvi through for the third run and makes his groundTwo slips for Dhoni
INDIA:14.4 Sami to Dhoni, no run, very full and on the off stump, Dhoni drives it to mid-offMS Dhoni, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:14.3 Sami to Pandya, out Caught by Hafeez!! Edgeddddd, juggling act and it's taken at first slip. Nothing but a short of length delivery outside off stump, Pandya tries to push hard at it away from the body, gets a thick edge, Hafeez moved to his left, got both hands to it. Had it covered, but it popped out, he palmed it twice before grabbing it on the third attempt. It's 76/5 and India need 8 runs to win. Pandya c Hafeez b Sami 0(2)Sami to Pandya, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:14.2 Sami to Pandya, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Pandya pushes it to pointHardik Pandya, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:14.1 Sami to Kohli, out Lbw!! Shout from Sami for LBW. Umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge thinks and then puts the finger up. Kohli can't believe that the umpire gave that out. He smiles back at the umpire and stands his ground. Well, well, well, there is a big inside edge onto it and Kohli was rightly disappointed with the decision. Is still smiling on his way to the dressing room. Oh the replay shows that Kohli swore at the umpire. Can't type what he said here. Good length delivery on the off stump, Kohli tries to flick, gets an inside edge onto pad, impact was on off, but the umpire missed the edge. Kohli also showed his bat to the umpire before the finger was raised. Anyway, he misses his fifty by a run. End of an excellent knock under pressure. Kohli lbw b Sami 49(51) [4s-7]Sami to Kohli, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Mohammad Sami [3.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:13.6 Riaz to Yuvraj, no run, short delivery outside off stump, Yuvraj had no clue about it, only tried to fend awkwardly after hopping, was always going to be different
INDIA:13.5 Riaz to Kohli, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli taps it with soft hands towards cover and sets off
INDIA:13.4 Riaz to Kohli, FOUR, brilliant shot from Kohli. Full and in the slot, Kohli waits for the ball to come and nails the drive through cover. Amazing how life works! In the same game, a bloke goes for 18 runs and takes 3 massive wickets and another leaks runs at will. Such a poor show this from Riaz
INDIA:13.3 Riaz to Yuvraj, 1 run, fullish and on the stumps, Yuvraj works it to mid-wicket
INDIA:13.2 Riaz to Kohli, 1 run, now this is crunched from the middle of the bat, driven well and along the ground through cover, there is protection in the deep though
INDIA:13.1 Riaz to Kohli, no run, full and in the slot, Kohli goes hard at the drive, toe-ends it to the left of cover, thinks about a run, but Yuvraj says no. Kohli goes back to his crease and has a look at the bottom of his batWahab Riaz [2.0-0-20-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:12.6 Irfan to Kohli, 1 run, this is easy for Kohli. Back of a length and outside off stump, Kohli runs it down to third man and keeps strike
INDIA:12.5 Irfan to Yuvraj, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Yuvraj swings across the line and aims mid-wicket, but mistimes it on the bounce and wide of long-on. Straightaway Yuvraj signals to the dug-out for a change of batA free-hit for Yuvraj
INDIA:12.5 Irfan to Kohli, no ball, 1 run, it's another no-ball, this time Irfan oversteps, Kohli guides it to third man
INDIA:12.4 Irfan to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli defends towards backward point
INDIA:12.3 Irfan to Kohli, no run, round the wicket and it's a short ball outside off stump, ignored. Did he think of that Tendulkar ramp over the slip cordon?
INDIA:12.2 Irfan to Kohli, 2 runs, shortish and bouncing a bit extra, Kohli hops and tucks it into the vacant mid-wicket region, straightaway calls for two, charges back and easily makes his ground. In fact, Kohli was halfway through the second run even before the fielder rushed from the deep and picked up the ball
INDIA:12.1 Irfan to Kohli, no run, good length delivery outside off stump, defended off the front footMohammad Irfan [3.0-0-10-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:11.6 Sami to Yuvraj, no run, a good looking back foot punch, but straight to mid-off. Kohli will keep the strike
INDIA:11.5 Sami to Yuvraj, no run, Sami angles the good length delivery away from the left-hander, a cement-footed Yuvraj pokes at it and gets beaten
INDIA:11.4 Sami to Kohli, 1 run, short ball at 139kph, Kohli pulls, rolls his wrists over the shot to keep the ball down and it goes to deep backward square leg
INDIA:11.3 Sami to Kohli, FOUR, this guy loves making runs against Pakistan. Loves pressure situations and he's playing a lovely innings here. Good length delivery angled in on the leg stump, Kohli doesn't try to do anything fancy, just flicks it through mid-wicket and there are big open spaces on the on-side
INDIA:11.2 Sami to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery slightly closer to the off stump, Kohli taps it towards backward point, was keen for a run, but Yuvraj rightly sent him back. Never a run there
INDIA:11.1 Sami to Kohli, no run, beaten! He left a similar delivery in Sami's previous over, but this time he throws his bat at to cut as soon as he sees width on offer outside off stump, only connects with thin airThe shoulders have dropped a bit there among the Pakistani fielders. The ball isn't doing much now and India need only 26 runs with 7 wickets in hand. Not mentioning the balls, because there are so many of them.
INDIA:10.6 Riaz to Kohli, 1 run, slower delivery outside off stump, Kohli waits and steers it to third man. Fifty partnership comes up with that single
INDIA:10.5 Riaz to Yuvraj, 1 run, Yuvraj is not comfortable with short stuff. He manages to under-edge this pull to long leg though
INDIA:10.4 Riaz to Yuvraj, no run, slower off-cutter outside off stump, Yuvraj waits and cuts to backward point
INDIA:10.4 Riaz to Yuvraj, wide, and this is down the leg side, got to get the radar right
INDIA:10.3 Riaz to Yuvraj, no run, shortish and on the leg stump, Yuvraj is hurried on the pull, the ball hits high on the thigh pad
INDIA:10.2 Riaz to Yuvraj, no run, oh what was Yuvraj Singh doing there? That was an ugly leave. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Yuvraj misjudged the length there, not all that short as he thought, tried to leave, didn't drop his bat and hands in time, the ball slammed into the splice of the bat, hopefully it didn't break his bat, and rolled into the off-side
INDIA:10.1 Riaz to Yuvraj, no run, low full toss outside off stump, oh that was a gift, but Yuvraj toe-ends the drive to cover
INDIA:10.1 Riaz to Kohli, no ball, 1 run, oh no! This is going from bad to worse for Riaz. He's overstepped this time and a free-hit comes up. Short of a length delivery angled, Kohli punches it to the right of mid-onGreat to see Sami run in and bowl above 140kph. Mind you, he's 35 years old and it's not easy to consistently bowl at that pace and more importantly at that age
INDIA:9.6 Sami to Yuvraj, no run, wow! A quick bouncer and Yuvraj was completely surprised. Short and on the stumps, Yuvraj was hurried on the pull, missed it totally
INDIA:9.5 Sami to Kohli, 1 run, on the front foot and on the rise, driven to the left of cover, but there is protection in the deep
INDIA:9.4 Sami to Kohli, no run, good length delivery at 142kph, defended with a straight bat back to the bowler
INDIA:9.3 Sami to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, probably could have been cut away, but Kohli reads the situation and patiently shoulders arms
INDIA:9.2 Sami to Kohli, no run, oh the leading edge is found, but it goes along the ground and rolls to cover. Very full and on the stumps, Kohli was attempting to play across the line, luckily it wasn't a thick edge for cover to come into play
INDIA:9.1 Sami to Kohli, 2 runs, good length delivery outside off stump, Kohli tries to drive hard and away from the body, gets an inside edge that goes past the sticks to long legMohammad Sami [1.0-0-4-0] is back into the attackSo the Indians will feel a lot more relaxed after that over. 15 off it and it released all the pressure. Mind you, Amir conceded just 18 runs in his entire spell! And that too, two boundaries came off his last over, which spoiled his figures a bit. Unfortunately for Pakistan, he's finished for the day.
INDIA:8.6 Riaz to Yuvraj, no run, on a length and on the stumps, Yuvraj defends
INDIA:8.5 Riaz to Yuvraj, FOUR, 15 already off the over and we have one more ball to go! Full and in the slot, on the stumps, Yuvraj goes deep in the crease, uses his wrists very well and flicks it through backward square leg, Irfan was never going to stop that running from fine leg
INDIA:8.4 Riaz to Kohli, 1 run, short of length delivery from round the wicket, Kohli opens the face of the bat and guides it to third man
INDIA:8.3 Riaz to Kohli, FOUR, overpitched and this is turning out to be a poor bowling change for Pakistan. Kohli leans forward, drives from the middle of the bat through that big gap at cover and it rockets to the fence
INDIA:8.2 Riaz to Kohli, 2 runs, don't bowl on the pads to Kohli, he'll flick/whip/nudge you all day. Easily worked away through mid-wicket
INDIA:8.1 Riaz to Kohli, FOUR, first ball of a new spell and Kohli thrashes it for four! How is Riaz going to react to this? He's a tough character. Anyone remember the quarterfinal against Australia in the 2015 World Cup? Full and outside off stump, Kohli crashes the drive through cover, there was a man sweeping the off-side fence but it was well wide of himWahab Riaz, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:7.6 Irfan to Kohli, leg byes, 1 run, short of length delivery down the leg-side, Kohli will feel that he's missed out on a boundary-scoring opportunity, a fine little tickle would have been fout, but Kohli misses the glance, the ball rolls off the thigh pad towards short fine leg
INDIA:7.5 Irfan to Kohli, FOUR, he's guided this deliberately despite there being a man at fly slip, in the end it turns out to be a well-calculated shot. I say that because Kohli knew that third man was very square, hence he opted for that high-risk shot. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Kohli guides it fine, fly slip dives to his right, falls short, third man runs to his left and dives, but loses the race
INDIA:7.4 Irfan to Kohli, no run, Kohli is clearly trying to use Irfan's angle away from the right-hander, plays with an open face, this time he finds Umar Akmal at gully
INDIA:7.3 Irfan to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli plays with an angled bat trying to split backward point and gully, but Anwar Ali flies to his left and saves a few. Gets appreciation from his mates for his effort
INDIA:7.2 Irfan to Yuvraj, 1 run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Yuvraj hops and works it to square leg
INDIA:7.1 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, good length delivery that keeps a bit low, Yuvraj manages to defendNow that is the end of Mohammad Amir for tonight. Wherever you are, stand and applaud for this youngman, for he's bowled an inspirational spell. His figures read: 4-0-18-3. His first over was one of the best you'll see in international cricket under serious pressure.
INDIA:6.6 Amir to Kohli, no run, defended off the front foot with an angled bat to backward point, where Umar Akmal makes an excellent save
INDIA:6.5 Amir to Kohli, no run, back of a length at 147kph, keeps a bit low, Kohli was on the back foot to block, the ball hits the toe-end and rolls into the off-side
INDIA:6.4 Amir to Kohli, no run, round the wicket now from Amir, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli defends off the back foot to point
INDIA:6.3 Amir to Kohli, FOUR, now that is the class of Virat Kohli for you! Survives a tough phase, as soon as a loose delivery comes, he puts it away. Overpitched outside off stump, Kohli leans forward and caresses the drive through extra-cover for back-to-back boundaries. Is there a momentum shift now?
INDIA:6.2 Amir to Kohli, FOUR, can't say he controlled this shot. Anyway, this is the first boundary for Kohli. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, Kohli hops and flicks uppishly, would have been a straightforward catch for square leg, but the fielder was more at mid-wicket
INDIA:6.1 Amir to Kohli, no run, oh Kohli plays uppishly again, back of a length around off stump from over the wicket, Kohli pushes hard at it, gets it high on the bat, doesn't carry to point thoughAmir to bowl out
INDIA:5.6 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, short of length to round off the over from Irfan, Yuvraj covers the stumps this time and lets it go through to the keeper
INDIA:5.5 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, in the channel outside off stump, testing Yuvraj's patience, but the batsman simply shoulders arms
INDIA:5.4 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, ignored
INDIA:5.3 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, oh a lovely delivery once again! The ball is nipping around for Irfan. And his height would make things even more tougher for the batsman. Actually a fullish ball, but because of Irfan's height, it bounces extra and also comes back in, Yuvraj ends up playing outside the line on his defence and the ball once again just misses the off stump
INDIA:5.2 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, in the air, is that a dropped chance? Just bounced in front. Shortish and angled at the body of the batsman, Yuvraj short-arm jabs the pull, went in the air, Sharjeel at square leg sticks his right hand out but it doesn't carry to him
INDIA:5.2 Irfan to Yuvraj, wide, freebie, down the leg-side, easy call for the umpire
INDIA:5.1 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, oh how did that miss the off stump? Good length delivery angled in, just helds its line, Yuvraj played outside the line in an attempt to defend, the ball missed the inside edge and almost shaved the sticks as well. A lot of oohs and aahs out there. Got to move you feet forward Yuvraj!
INDIA:4.6 Amir to Kohli, no run, what an angle and he beats him straightaway. 145kph good length delivery outside off stump, Kohli for some reason flirts away from his body once again, is beaten all ends up. Could have been an outside edge to the keeperRound the wicket
INDIA:4.5 Amir to Kohli, no run, punched off the back foot towards cover-point this time
INDIA:4.4 Amir to Kohli, no run, very full outside off stump, Kohli jams it to cover
INDIA:4.3 Amir to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli defends it to backward point. Oh no! What's happened there? Umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge is hit on the thigh by a throw. Umar Akmal there with a needless throw from backward point. The Sri Lankan is in pain and Akmal apologises immediately. A few of the Pakistani players check his health. The umpire was actually unaware that the throw was heading his way at the bowler's end, saw very late, tried to get away but couldn't and got it baaaang. Anyway, good to see him carry on
INDIA:4.2 Amir to Yuvraj, 1 run, Yuvraj pushes it to backward point for an easy single
INDIA:4.1 Amir to Kohli, 1 run, edgedddd and where is second slip, Shahid Afridi? That went right between the man at fly slip and gully. Would have been a regulation catch for second slip if there was one. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Kohli can't resist playing away from the body and pokes at it, thick edge and it flew away to third man
INDIA:4.1 Amir to Kohli, 5 wides, oh dear! Amir tried to bounce Kohli out, but he's banged this way too short, flew over Kohli's head and the keeper had no chance whatsoever. What's more, India get four bonus runs
INDIA:3.6 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, beaten! Good length delivery outside off stump, Yuvraj tries to defend without moving his front foot fully forward, ends up poking at it and gets beaten badly
INDIA:3.5 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, wow! What a snorter that. Bowled at around the short of length region, probably hit a crack or the seam, bowled at 142kph and it took off like a plane. Yuvraj couldn't have played at it, only tried to fend, could have so easily edged/gloved that to the keeper
INDIA:3.4 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, on a length and outside off stump, Yuvraj defends into the off-side
INDIA:3.3 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, and again! Careful Yuvraj, careful! On a length and outside off stump, Yuvraj wants to defend, toe-ends it and almost loses the sticks
INDIA:3.2 Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, oh inside edge onto pad as he tries to drive off the front foot again, but it goes wide of the sticks
INDIA:3.1 Irfan to Yuvraj, FOUR, aah! What better than a Yuvraj Singh cover drive. I must say that is is good captaincy from Afridi to leave cover open. He's got three wickets, he wants more, despite a low total, he is willing to take the risk. Full and outside off stump, Yuvraj leans forward and nails the cover drive to perfection. Off the mark in style and that will settle him a bitMohammad Irfan, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:2.6 Amir to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli offers a solid front foot defence
INDIA:2.5 Amir to Yuvraj, byes, 1 run, oh dear! That's a very bad leave Yuvraj Singh. Really bad leave. When you are leaving the ball, you got to cover the sticks. This was a length delivery angled in at 143kph, Yuvraj just left the ball alone, almost shaved the off stump, the keeper tried to dive low it his right and take the ball but fumbled. I think it hit him on the face off his wrist and then rolled into the outfieldYuvraj Singh, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:2.4 Amir to Raina, out Caught by Riaz!! In the airrrrr and it's a dolly. It's 8/3 now and Amir takes off like a plane in his celebrations. His team-mates mob him. After posting only 83 on the board, Pakistan have reduced India to 8/3. Not a great ball actually, but Amir and Pakistan won't mind. Raina wanted to work it on the on-side, wasn't well balanced as he lunged forward, got the leading edge and mid-on took a simple catch. Must say that Raina never looked comfortable at the crease and he perishes. Raina c Riaz b Amir 1(4)Amir to Raina, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:2.3 Amir to Kohli, leg byes, 1 run, Amir roars again for an LBW shout, a long thought from the umpire and then a shake of the head, much to Kohli's delight. Disbelief for Amir and Co. Slightly back of a length and swinging back in, Kohli for some reason plays right across the line and misses completely, hit on the back thigh pad, impact was on off stump but luckily for him height was an issue there and Hawk-Eye shows that it would have only clipped the top of off stump. Enough doubt for the umpire to give the batsman the benefit of doubtYuvraj Singh looks pretty tensed under that helmet in the dug-out. A small break in play and Pakistan change their field a bit.
INDIA:2.2 Amir to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli defends off the back foot
INDIA:2.1 Amir to Raina, 1 run, oh inside edge and almost knocked over! This was a short of length delivery outside off stump, kept very low, Raina wanted to hop and defend, got a thick edge because of the lack of bounce and luckily for him it rolled into the on-side off the pad
INDIA:1.6 Sami to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, testing Kohli's patience, India's No. 3 simply shoulders arms
INDIA:1.5 Sami to Kohli, 2 runs, Kohli checks his flick and it goes uppishly to the right of mid-on, oh that's sloppy from Riaz there, who fumbles and allows an extra runThe crowd gets right behind Amir and chants, "Amir, Amir, Amir." After the end of that over, a lot of the Pakistani fielders patted Amir on the back for his inspirational over.
INDIA:1.4 Sami to Kohli, no run, on a length and tight around the off stump, Kohli defends from the crease
INDIA:1.3 Sami to Kohli, 2 runs, too straight, Sami got greedy there and tried to start the outswinger from middle and off, but it so happens that it doesn't swing much and ends up on the leg stump line, easily worked away behind square on the on-side for a couple of runs
INDIA:1.2 Sami to Kohli, no run, Kohli plays away from the body, Pakistan won't mind that, he pushes away at this short of length delivery and sends it to pointTwo slips for Kohli as well
INDIA:1.1 Sami to Kohli, no run, just a gentle bit of outswing on this short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli defends it towards backward pointMohammad Sami, right-arm fast, comes into the attackWhat an opening over from Mohammad Amir. As I said earlier, if there is an attack that can defend 83, it is this Pakistani bowling attack. Brilliant execution of swing bowling at pace.
INDIA:0.6 Amir to Raina, no run, Raina gets behind the line of this length delivery and defends
INDIA:0.5 Amir to Raina, no run, beaten! Short of a length delivery swinging away outside off stump, Raina pokes at it away from the body and almost kisses it to the keeperSuresh Raina, left handed bat, comes to the creaseTwo slips in place
INDIA:0.4 Amir to Rahane, out Lbw!! This is a sensational opening over from Amir. He's beating the Indian batsmen for pace. Good length delivery swinging back in around off stump line, Rahane tries to defend on the move, his front foot got a long way across the stumps and his head was falling over to the off-side as well. Can't do that to an incoming delivery and Rahane pays the price. The impact was right on off stump and it would have shattered the off stump. Oh yes, Hawk Eye confirms the same. Once again the appeal was spontaneous and up went the finger. An Indian fan in the stands had his hands on his head in disappointment. Rahane lbw b Amir 0(1)Amir to Rahane, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
INDIA:0.4 Amir to Rahane, wide, this is down the leg-side, Rahane fails to tickle, would have been four had he got bat on ball, anyway he'll get an extra delivery
INDIA:0.3 Amir to Kohli, 1 run, very full and outside off stump, Kohli leans forward and tries to drive, gets a thick outside edge that rolls wide of the cordon to third manVirat Kohli, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:0.2 Amir to Rohit, out Lbw!! There you go! This is the start you want defending a small score. Head coach Waqar Younis would be very happy with Amir's effort. No freebies, warmed up nicely and running in fast. Full and swinging back in, once again Rohit is late on the defence, hit plumb in front of middle stump. Loud shout and the umpire was under pressure again. Thought about it for a long time and raised the finger, much to the delight of the Pakistani players. Rohit, the in-form batsman is gone for a silver duck and that is a massive blow for India. The replay shows that Rohit played outside the line of that delivery on that occasion. Rohit lbw b Amir 0(2)Amir to Rohit, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
INDIA:0.1 Amir to Rohit, no run, oh my word! A louuddddd shout, not given and Pakistan can't believe it! Afridi has a chat with the umpire. What a ball first up. That looked very out for me. Fast inswinging yorker from Amir, Rohit was late in bringing his bat down, the ball hit the boot in line with the off stump and that would have probably crashed into the off stump. The Pakistani players can't believe that it wasn't given outRahane and Rohit are at the crease. Rahane is on strike. Amir will open the attackWelcome back for the run chase. The groundsmen are using the hessian to absorb a bit of dew on the outfield. Dew has made its presence, so that means that the ball will come on to the bat better. However, the new ball will do its bit and Dhoni said, the batsmen will have to show respect for a while before playing the shots. Yes, it's a small target but there is no place for complacency. If there is an attack that you when need defending a small score, it is this Pakistani bowling attack. Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Amir, Wahab Riaz and Mohammad Sami. All express pace. Mind you, even Hardik Pandya, who is military medium, got extra bounce and good luck to the Indian batsmen when facing Irfan. We are all set for the action to begin.Such a shame. People have been waiting for this contest to begin from as early as the draw was made, and Pakistan decide to do THIS. Yes, there was some assistance for the bowlers. Yes, the Indian bowlers were at it all the time. But 83? Even the word 'shambolic' would look down on them with disgust. On a track with lots of green, looks like Pakistan shot themselves in the dressing room itself. Rather than scaling down their aspirations early on, their top order came out flashing. And the Indian bowlers couldn't be happier. Why wouldn't they rejoice, all their work was taken over by reckless batting, ridiculous running, and a self-implosion of Pakistani proportions. The second half of the match is more like a lifeless corpse now. Surely.A job very well done by India and even they would be surprised with how Pakistan capitulated, folding up for 83. "Stick to your strengths, there is always pressure in an India game, execution" and all that well-trained PR exercise has certainly helped Bumrah as he churns out one cliche after the other with monotonous regularity. Must say the questions were poor to him as well and that can be the only defence he can have. How about saying, "we demolished Pakistan" and "they have zero chance" Bumrah? Anyway wait for the summary and I'm sure it will be laced with even more sarcasm and wit as it is done by - I won't tell you who!1
PAKISTAN:17.3 Pandya to Amir, out Bowled!! All over. This is a deflating performance from Pakistan. So deflating for their fans, that I wouldn't be surprised if some of them asked for their money back after watching this. Some might even leave now. At this moment. On a length and cuts back in, beats Amir's flat-footed poke and takes out middle. The stump stays on the ground presenting a sorry look and the same can be said about Pakistan's scorecard at the moment. And again Pandya does his sideways heel click ala Brett Lee and distinctly comes off second best in that one. The original is always better, Hardik. A piece of free advice from me. But one more look at the replay and must say it wasn't a bad second effort from him. Anyway India have an easy chase on their hands. Amir b Pandya 1(8)Pandya to Amir, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Mohammad Irfan, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:17.2 Pandya to Sami, out Caught by Raina!! Call that genius captaincy or horrid bad batting. Pick one of the two depending on which team you support. But as Harsha Bhogle says on air, MS and Pandya wanted exactly the same shot from Sami after sending square leg back. Sami obliges and walks back. Quick bouncer from Pandya, hurried Sami onto the pull, the top edge settles in Raina's hands at deep square. As easy as it comes. Sami c Raina b Pandya 8(16) [4s-1]Pandya to Sami, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Mid-wicket comes up and square leg goes back
PAKISTAN:17.1 Pandya to Sami, no run, had he connected that, it would've gone to Bengal. Instead he connects thin air. On a length and outside off, Sami swings wildly to leg and missesHardik Pandya [3.0-0-8-1] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:16.6 Ashwin to Sami, 1 run, tossed up and Sami gets forward to whip that uppishly to long-on
PAKISTAN:16.5 Ashwin to Sami, no run, on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler
PAKISTAN:16.4 Ashwin to Amir, 1 run, had there been a throw right at the stumps, Sami would've been struggling. Instead it is wide and Sami is in
PAKISTAN:16.3 Ashwin to Amir, no run, dangerous to play the cut from the stumps, that's what Amir does, makes room and guides it to backward point
PAKISTAN:16.2 Ashwin to Sami, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Sami gets forward and drives to sweeper cover, straight to the fielder
PAKISTAN:16.2 Ashwin to Sami, 5 wides, what happened there? Ashwin has lost it and fired it down leg. Not a cat's chance in hell for Mahendra Singh Dhoni and he didn't even try. Five bonus runs. Akin to giving a dying man water in a desert. Precious runs these
PAKISTAN:16.1 Ashwin to Sami, FOUR, a slog and four. Sami picks the offie and goes over backward square leg, no-one there and it is a one-bounce four. Connected sweetly
PAKISTAN:15.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Amir, no run, turns in slightly, Amir defends with bat and pad close together towards point. End of a super quick over from Ravindra Jadeja
PAKISTAN:15.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Amir, no run, tossed up outside off, gets forward and drives to short cover
PAKISTAN:15.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Amir, no run, stays low and beats Amir's cut. Not there for the cut and the skiddiness of Ravindra Jadeja forced the ball to rush past the bat
PAKISTAN:15.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Amir, no run, pushed back to the bowler
PAKISTAN:15.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Amir, no run, on middle and leg, defended
PAKISTAN:15.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Amir, wide, MS heard something, but called wide. Did it flick the glove? Not so sure. Need a replay and this fella Ravindra Jadeja is bowling so quickly, that I have to be Superman and Batman combined to know everything. Not a chance in hellMohammad Amir, left handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:15.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Sarfraz, out Bowled!! "Why would you want to look at that?" asks Harsha Bhogle on air. Exactly. Why? Can't understand this fascination of checking for the front foot no-ball when it's half-and-half. As far as I have seen, Ravindra Jadeja has bowled just one front foot no-ball. Here he is not even close. This was round-armish and slung in, came back a long way and completely beat Sarfraz on the cut, he exposed all three stumps and the ball cannoned into them. He wasn't expecting the ball to come back in so much. Waited for a moment when the third umpire had a look and then walked back disappointed. Sarfraz b Ravindra Jadeja 25(24) [4s-3]Ravindra Jadeja to Sarfraz, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
PAKISTAN:14.6 Ashwin to Sarfraz, 1 run, Sarfraz connects with the sweep. Ashwin goes "ooohhhh" after holding his hands on his head. It was drifting in, Sarfraz knelt down and got bat on that, would've been a long and huge cry had Sarfraz missed that. More importantly he retains strike with that
PAKISTAN:14.5 Ashwin to Sarfraz, no run, the carrom ball, Sarfraz punches it back to Ashwin
PAKISTAN:14.4 Ashwin to Sami, 1 run, not sure who the fielder was at mid-wicket, did his best to cut off the single, but the ball escaped past his grasp, the batsmen jog across
PAKISTAN:14.3 Ashwin to Sami, no run, tossed up offie, spins in, Sami goes back and pushes to point
PAKISTAN:14.2 Ashwin to Sarfraz, 1 run, gets a quick single to short mid-wicket, placed it well
PAKISTAN:14.1 Ashwin to Sarfraz, FOUR, that's good batting. Sarfraz comes down the track and goes for a calculated blow, picked the spot as well, wide of long-on, got to the pitch off the offie and heaved it away, getting a boundary
PAKISTAN:13.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Sami, no run, again very quick on off, Sami blocks off the front foot to cover. That over ended so quickly
PAKISTAN:13.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Sami, no run, flicked to mid-wicket and Sarfraz took a few steps out looking for the quick single, Sami wasn't one bit interested
PAKISTAN:13.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Sami, no run, fired in on off, Sami gets the bat in front of the pad and defends to cover
PAKISTAN:13.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Sarfraz, 1 run, calmly nudges a single wide of mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:13.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Sarfraz, FOUR, fabulous late dab. The width was there, not by much mind you, but Sarfraz went back and opens the face of the bat very late to get it well wide of short third, the ball beats the fielder and races away to the fence. Pakistan needed that boundary
PAKISTAN:13.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Sarfraz, no run, had Sarfraz not got bat on that, he would've been walking back as well. Pre-meditated sweep, got a bit of glove/bat and the ball rolls to short fine
PAKISTAN:12.6 Ashwin to Sami, no run, this goes straight on and Sami keeps it out off the back foot
PAKISTAN:12.5 Ashwin to Sami, no run, turns in slowly, Sami went back and punches it to the right of Rahane. No run again
PAKISTAN:12.4 Ashwin to Sami, no run, now the slider, goes straight on, Sami drives and gets a thick outside edge, more good fielding and good captaincy from MS, he has kept Rahane there, he dives to his left and cuts off any chance of a single
PAKISTAN:12.3 Ashwin to Sarfraz, 1 run, the carrom ball on middle, Sarfraz wrists it off the back foot wide of mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:12.2 Ashwin to Sami, 1 run, must say that is well done that time. Dabbed in front of Bumrah at short third, picked the fielder and the tall man was caught napping, Sarfraz is well in even as Bumrah misses with a direct hit
PAKISTAN:12.1 Ashwin to Sami, no run, tossed up and turning in, Sami gets forward and then nudges it to the left of MS, no chance of a quick single thereRavichandran Ashwin, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:11.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Sarfraz, 2 runs, comes down the track and then whips across the line of that flighted ball, gets it wide of long-on and comes back for the second, easily done
PAKISTAN:11.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Sarfraz, no run, slower and on the stumps, defended from the crease
PAKISTAN:11.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Sami, 2 wides, down leg and MS can't gather it in as well. Two runs added to the totalMohammad Sami, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:11.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Riaz, out Lbw!! Folks, this is a mismatch. An absolute mismatch. It is like Barcelona playing against a fourth division side, running riot over them. Excuse me for that shameless plug of my favorite football team. I had to get it in somehow. So pathetic is Pakistan's state at this moment in time, one can have a look at their fans in the stands. A lady just shakes her head and wonders what is going on out there. Riaz had already decided that sweep was the shot to play, irrespective of where the ball pitched, plonked his big front foot forward and went across the line. The ball pitched middle and missed the bat to strike the batsman right in front. Plummb lbw that. Would've hit middle low down. Riaz lbw b Ravindra Jadeja 4(12)Ravindra Jadeja to Riaz, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
PAKISTAN:11.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Riaz, no run, slower and on the stumps, pushed back to Ravindra Jadeja
PAKISTAN:11.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Riaz, no run, well-fielded with a dive to the left by Ravindra Jadeja, the body weight was going the other way but he turned around and then stopped the fierce drive. Saved a singleA slip in place as Ravindra Jadeja comes from round the wicket
PAKISTAN:11.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Sarfraz, 1 run, Sarfraz comes down the track and then whips it to deep backward square legRavindra Jadeja, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:10.6 Pandya to Riaz, no run, full and pushed back to the bowler
PAKISTAN:10.5 Pandya to Sarfraz, 1 run, now Sarfraz does the same as he gets a single to short mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:10.4 Pandya to Riaz, 1 run, short of length on the hips, Riaz gets inside the line and clips it to fine leg
PAKISTAN:10.3 Pandya to Sarfraz, 1 run, "this has to stop, this is schoolboy stuff, too jerky for my liking" goes Rameez Raja on air, trying his best to explain the running from the duo. It took the inside edge onto the pad and then went to the slip, Riaz was already committed to the run, Sarfraz wasn't so sure of it, wasn't sure where the ball went, but put his head down and ran forward. The fielder may have slipped and that's why the ball wasn't released at all. Must say again no communication whatsoever from the two batsmen out there
PAKISTAN:10.2 Pandya to Sarfraz, no run, fullish on off, Sarfraz gets forward and defends solidly to short cover
PAKISTAN:10.1 Pandya to Riaz, 1 run, full outside off, Riaz square drives and gets it off the toe end, but a single to third ma
PAKISTAN:9.6 Yuvraj to Riaz, 1 run, tossed up outside off, a pre-meditated sweep and only a single to deep mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:9.5 Yuvraj to Riaz, no run, well bowled. Quicker and on the stumps, Riaz too plays it well. Right back and defends with the bat in front of the pad. Seemed to have picked that up from the hand
PAKISTAN:9.4 Yuvraj to Riaz, no run, punches it straight to the fielder at backward point and there is no run there
PAKISTAN:9.3 Yuvraj to Sarfraz, 1 run, now Riaz has lost his head. Runs like a headless chicken wanting a second against RJ but the throw came to Yuvraj and not to Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Had it done so, another gift-wrapped wicket would've come India's way. It was pulled to the left of deep mid-wicket but Jadeja is so quick, he is way too quick and that has gone against him, had he lifted his head up and seen Riaz running, he would've thrown it to MS. A half-chance gone abegging
PAKISTAN:9.2 Yuvraj to Riaz, 1 run, this one holds up in the pitch, Riaz was already forward and then had to adjust to punch that wide of short cover
PAKISTAN:9.1 Yuvraj to Sarfraz, 1 run, loopy full toss outside off, Sarfraz gets forward and drives to deep extra cover
PAKISTAN:8.6 Pandya to Riaz, no run, Pandya is using the short ball well. Gets it to rise off the surface and beats Riaz's inside edge. Struck on the chest/rib area and the ball rolls to point. That wouldn't have the sturdy looking Riaz
PAKISTAN:8.5 Pandya to Riaz, no run, bouncer and Riaz is happy to go under that
PAKISTAN:8.4 Pandya to Sarfraz, 1 run, outside off, Sarfraz opens the face of the bat and runs it down to third man
PAKISTAN:8.3 Pandya to Sarfraz, no run, ooh! Even Pandya who is at best a military medium pacer is getting the ball to lift off the surface. Sarfraz is surprised and has to be quick to fend it down. Did so by taking the bottom hand off it. The ball goes to ground quickly
PAKISTAN:8.2 Pandya to Sarfraz, no run, comes down the track and then defends to cover, wants a quick single and then decides against it. Sensible decision
PAKISTAN:8.1 Pandya to Sarfraz, no run, short of length outside off, dabbed to pointWahab Riaz, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:7.6 Yuvraj to Afridi, out Afridi Run Out!! 1 run completed. Not very smart from Afridi. Or from Sarfraz even. Why would you want to take on the best fielder in both the teams and that too when your side are struggling to bat the twenty overs out. Mindless is the only word I have for that. And even that is putting it mildly. It was tucked to deep square leg, once the batsmen have seen it was Jadeja, they should've settled for one, but Afridi decides to take on the arm and despite his full-length dive, cannot beat the flat throw from the deep, right next to the stumps and MS demolishes them. Replays show that Kohli gave a cheeky little send-off as well. Afridi run out (Ravindra Jadeja/Dhoni) 2(2)Yuvraj to Afridi, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
PAKISTAN:7.5 Yuvraj to Sarfraz, 1 run, in the air and in no-man's land. Sarfraz went for the sweep too early. Lucky that the toe end of the bat was found and even more luckier that the ball didn't go to any fielder nerby. Lands at square leg
PAKISTAN:7.4 Yuvraj to Sarfraz, FOUR, Sarfraz can counter-attack at will and we have seen that many a time. This was a bad ball, mind you, short and wide outside off, easy for Sarfraz to place the cut wide of backward point. Once he beat the fielder inside the ring, it was four. Releases the pressure a bit too
PAKISTAN:7.3 Yuvraj to Sarfraz, no run, tossed up outside off, slower, driven off the front foot to cover
PAKISTAN:7.2 Yuvraj to Afridi, 1 run, flat outside off, muscled off the back foot to long-on. Boom Boom gets off the mark first ballShahid Afridi, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:7.1 Yuvraj to U Akmal, out Lbw!! Yuvraj strikes and that's plumb. We are in for an early finish here folks! There I jinxed it. Now the match will end off the last ball. Angled in and kept a bit low, U Akmal played outside the line of the ball, missed the forward defence and the replays show that it was hitting middle. Cannot leave so much gap between bat and pad, clearly Akmal was late in getting his bat down in a straight line to play that. What a wicket for Yuvraj and India. And everyone are jumping on Yuvraj in celebration. U Akmal lbw b Yuvraj 3(4)Yuvraj to U Akmal, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Yuvraj Singh, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attackSarfraz Ahmed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:6.6 Pandya to Shoaib Malik, out Caught by Dhoni!! The fourth one goes. After cramping Shoaib Malik for room with wicket-to-wicket stuff, he dangles the carrot outside off and the batsman falls for it. Lovely full outswinger, inducing the drive and Shoaib Malik's balance was all wrong, as he drove without any feet and edged it behind. I wondered whether there was an edge on that after seeing MS take that. So nonchalantly done and then he belatedly appealed when he realised the umpire might not give it out. Meanwhile Pandya does a poor man's impression of Brett Lee, jumping high and clicking his heels in celebration. Shoaib Malik c Dhoni b Pandya 4(12) [4s-1]Pandya to Shoaib Malik, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:6.5 Pandya to Shoaib Malik, no run, fullish on off, Shoaib Malik gets forward to drive and the ball rolls of a closed bat face to mid-on. Good wicket-to-wicket stuff from PandyaActually coming back to the Manzoor wicket, it was Shoaib Malik who sold his partner down the river, took a couple of steps out and then retreated seeing Kohli swoop in on the ball. Manzoor set off and there was no way back from there. Replays have proved that I can't get everything right and many thanks for that
PAKISTAN:6.4 Pandya to Shoaib Malik, no run, tight delivery on the stumps, no room to work with at all, defended back
PAKISTAN:6.3 Pandya to U Akmal, 1 run, length outside off, opens the face of the bat and runs it down to third man
PAKISTAN:6.2 Pandya to U Akmal, no run, full outside off, Akmal mistimes the drive, rolls off the inside half of the bat to mid-on
PAKISTAN:6.1 Pandya to U Akmal, 2 runs, Yuvraj is the fielder at deep backward square and he prevents the boundary with a dive. Saved two. It was short on the stumps and Akmal rocked back to pull, it was heading to the boundary but Yuvraj got there firstHardik Pandya, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:5.6 Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, no run, now an inside edge onto the pad on the back foot defence. It nipped in sharply and Shoaib Malik was late on the defence, luckily he got some bat on that, or else there would've been another huge appeal. End of the powerplayUmar Akmal, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:5.5 Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, out Manzoor Run Out!! Kohli has hit direct and Manzoor is way out. A Pakistani fan in the stands just closes her mouth with her hands and is in disbelief. There was never a run there, it was pushed straight to the fielder and for some reason Manzoor set off, lost his bat in the process, once he did that, even a 5% chance of getting back was gone, but Kohli was so confident that he threw down the stumps with an overhead throw, without taking any time. Then the celebrations begin. A wasted wicket, when there was no run there. Not sure what went into Manzoor's mind there. Manzoor run out (Kohli) 10(18) [4s-1]Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
PAKISTAN:5.4 Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, no run, beautiful straight drive but the stumps at the other end have denied Pakistan a couple at least. Shoaib Malik got forward and showed the maker's name on that fullish delivery, drove it well but too straight in fact and the ball clatters into the stumps and off go the LED lights
PAKISTAN:5.3 Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, no run, length outside off, Shoaib Malik gets forward and defends
PAKISTAN:5.2 Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, no run, loud shout for lbw, not given. That looked close. Shoaib Malik struck low on the pad and in front, seemed to be no inside edge onto the pad as well. But again the umpire negates the huge appeal. Need a replay to see why that wasn't given
PAKISTAN:5.1 Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, leg byes, FOUR, sliding down leg, all it needed was a faint tickle, off the pad and runs away
PAKISTAN:4.6 Nehra to Manzoor, no run, slower delivery outside off, Manzoor was aiming for a big hit, went deep in his crease and looked to slam the ball out of the park, lost all timing and the ball rolled to mid-off
PAKISTAN:4.5 Nehra to Manzoor, no run, tight delivery on the stumps, defended back to the bowler
PAKISTAN:4.4 Nehra to Manzoor, no run, what was that? Clear glove and the umpire shakes his head. Manzoor pre-meditated the shuffle and got down to scoop that, was early into the shot, off the glove and MS clearly heard the snick, but Nehra was late on the appeal, by the time he saw his captain going up for it, he joined in, but the Bangladeshi umpire whose spelling is a bit confusing for me to type it out, shakes his head. Virat Kohli gets his first chance to say out his favorite outburst today. Clearly he didn't like that call. Must say Manzoor is still lucky to be out there
PAKISTAN:4.3 Nehra to Manzoor, 2 runs, Hardik at mid-on makes a mess of that. Manzoor used his feet and flat-batted that straight to Hardik who allowed himself to be nutmegged by the ball. Gives away two. MS wouldn't be too impressed with that effort
PAKISTAN:4.2 Nehra to Manzoor, no run, good fielding by Kohli at cover. It was punched to his right and he ran across and then put in the dive to stop it. Keeps Manzoor on strike. There was a bit of miscommunication between the two batsmen, but no real danger of a run out there
PAKISTAN:4.1 Nehra to Manzoor, no run, this strikes Manzoor on the back leg, but the height on that would've taken it over. That's why there was no real appeal for lbw. It nipped in sharply and struck Manzoor in-line after the batsman whipped and missed
PAKISTAN:3.6 Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, no run, top delivery from Bumrah, angles it in towards off stump, it completely opens Shoaib Malik up, but once it hits the seam, it jags the other way and swings away from MS' gloves, Shoaib Malik was playing for the angle in and once it hit the seam, he was left all at sea. Cracker of a delivery to end the over
PAKISTAN:3.5 Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, top shot from Shoaib Malik. He always plays well against India. Never lets his team down. Stood on his toes, stayed beside the line of the ball and punched it past a diving RJ at point, Jadeja did his best, but the timing on that took it past the dive. No way that third man could've stopped that as wellTwo slips in place now
PAKISTAN:3.4 Bumrah to Shoaib Malik, no run, very iffy from Shoaib Malik. He is neither here nor there. Is in a dilemma whether to play or leave, in the corridor of uncertainty outside off, Shoaib Malik hung his bat out that and doing so, was holding it inside the line, close to his body as well. Not far from taking the outside edgeShoaib Malik, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:3.3 Bumrah to Sharjeel Khan, out Caught by Rahane!! The slower short ball has done it for Bumrah. Sharjeel Khan went hard on the cut and an innovative piece of captaincy from MS has to be appreciated as well, he has placed Rahane at around fourth slip, it went straight to him and he doesn't drop many, does he? Easy grab and Bumrah has consumed the other opener. The width was there, but it bounced extra and that's why it took the outside edge. Sharjeel Khan c Rahane b Bumrah 7(5) [4s-1]Bumrah to Sharjeel Khan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:3.2 Bumrah to Sharjeel Khan, no run, slants it full outside off, Sharjeel Khan leaves it. Was he thinking it would be called a wide? But it was well inside the guideline
PAKISTAN:3.1 Bumrah to Sharjeel Khan, FOUR, magnificent shot and first runs off Bumrah. It wasn't a bad ball at all, on a length on off, but Sharjeel Khan rocked back and muscled the short-arm jab wide of mid-on, pure timing on the shot and no chance for anyone on the field, once it went past the infield. The bottom hand took over and he gave it a mighty thwack. Certainly would've woken Bumrah upLooking at how the first three overs have gone so far, a score of around 140-45 should be very competitive, especially if Pakistan can strike quick blows with the new ball. Definite assistance for the quick bowlers. Pakistan should set a realistic target on their mind and approach the rest of the innings, rather than aiming too high and falling well below what is required on this one
PAKISTAN:2.6 Nehra to Manzoor, no run, good length and stays a bit low, Manzoor stands up tall to punch that, but since the ball didn't come on as he expected, he mistimes it to mid-off. Good comeback in those last two balls by Nehra. Pulled things back slightly
PAKISTAN:2.5 Nehra to Manzoor, no run, pitches around leg or outside even, on a length, Manzoor flicks and misses, it rolls off the thigh and goes towards cover. No real appeal from India as they knew that nothing was going for that one
PAKISTAN:2.5 Nehra to Manzoor, wide, down leg, Nehra has lost his mojo this over
PAKISTAN:2.4 Nehra to Sharjeel Khan, 3 runs, now does a BC Lara - lifting one leg up in the air and pulling over square leg. Bumrah has a long chase from long leg and despite his best effort, has to land on the ball and does so awkwardly, manages to push it to the backing up fielder, saved a run
PAKISTAN:2.3 Nehra to Sharjeel Khan, no run, this one stays low and beats a flat-footed attempt at a cut from Sharjeel Khan. On a length and outside off, beaten was the batsman. Another low percentage shot played
PAKISTAN:2.2 Nehra to Manzoor, 3 runs, no-one apart from Jadeja on the field tonight could've saved that. That is the class and the athletic ability of the man from Saurashtra. It was tapped to his right at point, the ball despite not being timed well, was racing across, but Jadeja sprinted after that and put in the dive to pull the ball back in, just before it hit the ropes. Saved a run for his side, shows the total committment of the man. Gets the cheers from the crowd
PAKISTAN:2.1 Nehra to Manzoor, FOUR, takes the aggressive route and gets four. Clears his front leg and whacks the back of a length delivery on the stumps to deep mid-wicket, thumped the pull and it raced away
PAKISTAN:2.1 Nehra to Sharjeel Khan, 2 wides, that is a bad call from the umpire. It clearly went off the pad and even Nehra looks disappointed with that decision. Sliding down leg, Sharjeel Khan flicks and misses, off the pad and half-stopped by Dhoni on the dive. But the umpire for some reason ruled it as wides
PAKISTAN:1.6 Bumrah to Manzoor, no run, another false stroke and it's a maiden from Bumrah. Fullish around the fourth stump line, Manzoor went hard on the drive and the ball rolls to mid-on. Came off the inside half of the bat. That is a good opening over from Bumrah, he troubled Manzoor with the inswingers and caused a lot of discomfort
PAKISTAN:1.5 Bumrah to Manzoor, no run, now an inside edge onto the pad on the flick. Definitely a lbw candidate, this Manzoor. Plonks his front foot forward and then tries to manufacture a flick to leg, the inside edge saved him, the ball rolls to cover
PAKISTAN:1.4 Bumrah to Manzoor, no run, full on off, Manzoor gets forward and drives straight to the fielder at mid-on. Played around his front pad, but did well to get it off the middle of the bat
PAKISTAN:1.3 Bumrah to Manzoor, no run, again Manzoor falls over. Misses the flick to a leg-side delivery, off the pad and caught by a forward-running Bumrah, no bat and India don't appeal too. Bumrah is getting the ball to angle in sharply and getting seam movement to boot as well
PAKISTAN:1.2 Bumrah to Manzoor, no run, loose. Very loose from Manzoor. Went after a pacy length delivery outside off, looking to drive and lucky not to have edged that. The ball swung after beating the edge and MS did well to move to his right to glove. When the ball is moving around, not wise to go after the ball, especially when you haven't got your eye in
PAKISTAN:1.1 Bumrah to Manzoor, no run, Bumrah is jumping up and down, pleading with the umpire for an lbw but nothing doing from the Bangladeshi. It nipped in and struck Manzoor outside the line of off, missing the inside edge and thudding into the back thigh. Clearly not outJasprit Bumrah, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:0.6 Nehra to Manzoor, 1 run, very full and outside off, Manzoor leant forward and went for a big square drive, got it off the toe-end but managed a single to third man
PAKISTAN:0.5 Nehra to Manzoor, no run, this one cramps Manzoor for room on the off stump, defended from the crease to coverKhurram Manzoor, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:0.4 Nehra to Hafeez, out Caught by Dhoni!! Hafeez walks. And Nehra begins his trademark celebration. Fingers waving and running forward. This was a lifter outside off, Hafeez went for a flashy square cut and the extra bounce took the outside edge, MS leapt a little and snaffled it without no problems. The length wasn't there for the shot and must say an ambitious stroke attempted by Hafeez. Maybe the four lulled him into a false sense of over confidence. Nehra strikes in his opening over. Hafeez c Dhoni b Nehra 4(4) [4s-1]Nehra to Hafeez, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:0.3 Nehra to Hafeez, no run, ooh! This one stayed low and on off, Hafeez did well to keep it out. Crouched low and the ball rolled to slip on the bounce. Had he missed that, would've crashed into off
PAKISTAN:0.2 Nehra to Hafeez, FOUR, beautiful shot to get off the mark. That's Hafeez at his best. Leant on a full delivery outside off and then opened the bat face to get it between point and cover. Once he hit the gap, the quick outfield did the rest. That should give Hafeez a lot of confidence. He feeds off on strokes like those. Classy and with a high front elbow to boot
PAKISTAN:0.1 Nehra to Hafeez, no run, very full and on off, slight shape in to Hafeez, he gets forward and drives to mid-offHafeez and Sharjeel Khan are at the crease. Hafeez is on strike. Nehra will open the attackNehra has the new ball and we are all set to go. Hafeez will start off proceedings. The countdown begins in earnest and MS says "let's play". A slip and a sort of fourth slip/gully in for Nehra as he runs inSo all in readiness for the most exciting game of this Asia Cup to get underway. Pakistan would've loved to have won the toss and bowled first, considering they have packed their side with four seamers. But the coin-toss was won by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and it will be the Indian seamers who will look to exploit any evening moisture out there. We saw Nehra hoop the ball around corners the other night against Bangladesh, can he do it again today?Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Khurram Manzoor, Sharjeel Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Sami, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad IrfanIndia (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Hardik Pandya, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashish Nehra, Jasprit BumrahAfridi: We wanted to bat first anyway. We are playing 4 genuine fast bowlers. Truly speaking, we are relaxed, very motivated and that's a good sign for me. There will be something on this pitch for the fast bowlers early on.Dhoni: We will bowl first. I think so far we have not really judged the wicket. This is slightly harder than the last time we played here. We have seen that the sides that have lost too many wickets early have found it difficult to win games. So we need to respect the bowlers initially. Once the dew comes on the outfield, the ball comes on better and it's easier to play the big shots. Pressure is always there. I am surviving (smiles, when asked about his back injury). Shikhar Dhawan has a niggle, Ajinkya Rahane is in.India have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe captains are walking out for the toss!Pitch Report: It is a very good pitch again. India have batted on this earlier against Bangladesh. The grass cover is slightly lesser on this pitch. It should be a bowl-first wicket, with the dew factor in mind."This pitch looks less greener than the ones used so far," chirps Ganesh Chandrasekaran, who is at the ground.So out of 6 games, Pakistan have beaten India only once in the T20I format. Shahid Afridi's boys would want to better that stat tonight. One can see MS Dhoni playing football in the warm-ups. So that's a sign that his back is fine. Remember, he played with a back-brace against Bangladesh and did not practice yesterday.Head-to-head: 2007 World T20: Durban - match tied, India win bowl-out. Johannesburg - Misbah's false scoop shot, India snatch victory from the jaws of defeat to be crowned champions. 2012 World T20: Virat Kohli's all-round show gives India an easy victory. Bangalore, 2012: Fifties from Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik seal the game for Pakistan despite Bhuvneshwar Kumar's dream debut. Ahmedabad, 2012: A Yuvraj Singh special outsmarts Pakistan. 2014 World T20: Pressure gets the better of Mohammad Hafeez and Co. as India beat Pakistan yet again in a World Cup.Mohammad Irfan v Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan v Wahab Riaz, Virat Kohli v Mohammad Amir - aah! This is going to be exciting. Don't be surprised if Pakistan include Mohammad Sami as well. If they do that can they strike a balance between bat and ball? It will be interesting to know the thought process of the Pakistani think tank. One thing is for sure. Everyone would be watching Mohammad Amir very closely, for he is very exciting, very energetic, fast, lethal and it's going to be great to watch him bowl against a quality Indian batting line-up.On the other hand, Shahid Afridi's boys will be raring to go after playing a fair bit of the T20 game, courtesy the Pakistan Super League (PSL). Umar Akmal, Sharjeel Khan and Mohammad Hafeez - have all been among the runs, scoring a minimum of 200 runs in the tournament. Old warhorse Mohammad Sami returns to the national side after grabbing eyeballs with his performance in the PSL. Pakistan generally have a good pace attack and the scenario is not going to change this time around as well. In fact, in the three games that we have had in this tournament so far, we have seen a fair bit of grass on the pitch and sometimes we have even seen batsmen struggle to cope with the extra bounce. This makes it very interesting. You might as well want to say that Pakistan's pace battery is better equipped to the conditions than India's. However, it all depends on how much amount of grass the groundsman leaves on the surface. Is there another green pitch in store?Rohit Sharma has been in scintillating touch, Virat Kohli has been doing very well. Shikhar Dhawan cracked a couple of fifties recently against Sri Lanka and India would want for more consistency from the left-hander and the middle-order. Where will Yuvraj Singh bat today? Is there a chance that Dhoni will promote him up the order? Time well tell. We saw a promotion work wonders for the Men in Blue the other day. Hardik Pandya, walking out ahead of Dhoni, hit the ball hard against Bangladesh and showed everyone about his big-hitting ability. With the ball, Ashish Nehra's experience has come in handy, while Jasprit Bumrah continues to impress with his skiddy pace and accuracy. Need no mention about the spinners, for they have been doing a great job. Having said all this, it's a different day and a game against Pakistan is always a high-voltage clash. How will Dhoni's boys handle the pressure?MS Dhoni and Co. have had a wonderful time with the shortest format of the game of late. First a whitewash for Australia in their own backyard and then a series victory over Sri Lanka at home. Just a couple of days ago, they were very good in the tournament opener against Bangladesh as well. The side looks pretty settled and Dhoni is very pleased to have a lot of bowling options. The key to this side is that there are at least 4 players, who can both bat and bowl their full quota of overs.18:15 Local Time, 12:15 GMT, 17:45 IST: A weekend, a Saturday evening, a T20 game and it's India v Pakistan. It can't get better than this in the cricketing fraternity. Welcome to game four of the 2016 Asia Cup. It's been over three years since these two sides played a bilateral series. They have been playing only in multi-lateral tournaments and the last time the arch-rivals locked horns was over an year ago at the 2015 World Cup. The rarity of the occasion raises the anticipation-expectation bar by a considerable amount. India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and UAE - have all opened their campaign in the tourney and it's Pakistan's turn now to open the account. Straightaway they are thrown into a pressure-cooker situation, but sometimes, pressure does bring the best out of one. Doesn't it?Preview by Ganesh Chandrasekaran:The marquee clash of the Asia Cup is set to be a mouth-watering one. India and Pakistan do not play each other often enough in the international circuit thanks to the political tension between the two countries. A rivalry bound by history is now restricted to tournaments such as these and ICC events only. The last time the two teams faced off was in the World Cup in 2015. And before that it was in the Asia Cup in Bangladesh in 2014.The proposed bilateral series between the two sides did not kick off after the Indian government failed to give the go-ahead. Thus, this contest gets a little more colour to it, off the field. For the players though, the challenges will be entirely different.For a lot of the Pakistan players, this will be their first taste of such a high-pressure game. India are luckier on that count. Only three from India's squad and only two from the first eleven - Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah - have not featured in an India-Pakistan encounter. For Pakistan the same figure counts up to six.While the edge of traditional rivalry continues, this particular one might not have the fierce undertones of previous clashes, but will be an important one, nevertheless, for both teams.Pakistan arrived in Bangladesh only a day before their first practice session. A lot of their players featured in the recently-concluded Pakistan Super League (PSL) and so will be in touch with the format. Their challenge will be to adapt to the conditions quick enough. If the conditions in Mirpur remain the same, they will find it a little easier to adjust as well, given their pace-heavy attack.For India it will be about continuing the momentum gathered. They are not expected to make any changes to the squad that won against Bangladesh, unless there are injury concerns. One such would be the fitness of skipper MS Dhoni. He did not take part in the practice session prior to the game and the reason given was that he needed a bit of rest. India will probably wait until match day to take a final call. He played through the first game with back spasms and will probably do so again, given the momentous occasion.Pakistan have imported Sharjeel Khan and Mohammad Nawaz after their impressive performances in the PSL. The duo are likely to find a spot straightaway in the playing eleven. Much of the focus though will surround Pakistan's pace attack. Foremost amongst them will be Mohammad Amir, who has had a steady comeback to international cricket. This will be his first game against India since making a return. No doubt there will be some fuss surrounding it, but should ease off once the game starts.If Pakistan go with all three left-arm seamers - Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Irfan and Amir - it would pose the Indian batsmen with an interesting challenge. Mohammad Sami will be breathing down their neck as well after doing well in the PSL.Pakistan's spin attack comprises of mainly all-rounders and they fit the role in this format. The individual plans will have been done as well. However the tradition of talk surrounding Pakistan's bowlers against Indian batsmen continues. This particular match will be even more interesting given the green nature of the Mirpur track.For both teams, the bigger picture will be the World T20. While India have their combination settled, this game will also kick start Pakistan's preparations for the same. On paper, they look a formidable mix with plenty of all-rounders. Their concern will be on zeroing in on the best middle order possible apart from the spinners.Mohammad Nawaz and Imad Wasim are pretty similar players, but the former is likely to get the nod ahead for the clash against India thanks to his PSL performance.There is plenty to look forward to as always is the case with any cricket match between these two teams. With another such clash coming up in less than a month, this one should act as an apt dress rehearsal for the same.Teams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Khurram Manzoor, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Imad Wasim, Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Sami, Sharjeel Khan, Khalid LatifIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashish Nehra, Jasprit Bumrah, Ajinkya Rahane, Harbhajan Singh, Pawan Negi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Parthiv PatelLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
