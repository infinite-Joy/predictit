Here we go...Zimbabwean bowlers bowled good lengths but failed to create any wicket-taking opportunity. This is not going to be an easy chase but one can never rule out the unpredictable Zimbabwean batting line-up. They have good stroke-makers at the top. However, the key will be, how they approach the game in the first 20 overs. Do join us back for Zimbabwe's response..Afghanistan didn't repeat the mistakes they committed in the first game. Mohammad Nabi notched up his maiden ODI ton and helped his team post a challenging total for the hosts. It was the 133-run stand between Nabi and Zadran which kept the scorecard ticking for the visitors. Stanikzai and Shenwari played a good hand towards the end and ensured that Nabi's ton didn't go in vain.4
