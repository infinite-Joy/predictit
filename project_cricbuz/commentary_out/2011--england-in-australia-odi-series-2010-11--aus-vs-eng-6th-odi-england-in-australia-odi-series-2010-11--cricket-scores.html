We are a bit inconsistent in all areas, there is a lot of room for improvement, we have a couple of games to play good cricket. Tait and Ferguson are in today. Marsh is injured, I don't know how long he's out for, it is disappointing. It is a great opportunity for Ferguson.Strauss: Looks like a good wicket, nice hot day, we need to put some good runs on board. We haven't been very consistent, we have two more opportunities to get things right. Shahzad is injured, Yardy comes in. We have to prepare for the WC and the best way to do that is to win these two games.Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the 6th ODI between England and Australia.
