Steyn will open the attackRight then, the players are back. A tough task ahead for India. But there is one man in the middle who has seen it all - Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar. The last time he played an ODI, he scored 200*, against the same opponent. This should be an exciting chase if he gets going!The Indians will be very pleased with this effort. Smith was sent back cheaply, but Amla continued the good work by scoring freely. He reached his fifty but departed soon after that. de Villiers and Duminy came together and strung a solid partnership. Both got past their fifties and a 300 plus score loomed on the horizon. However, the Indian part-timers came back and stifled the flow of runs in the middle overs. Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina got some crucial wickets and South Africa struggled to score quickly towards the end. The target of 290 is a great score on this wicket and it will be a difficult challenge for the Indians. South Africa's four-pronged pace attack will be a force to reckon with under lights and the Indian batsmen will have to play sensibly and aggressively. Join us at 10:10 PM IST for the run chase. 4

I have been working hard on my run up, that's the only adjustment that I have made after the start of my career. The guys are focused, the last week or so has been good, we haven't seen anyone work as hard as they have been doing.Zaheer Khan: The T20 was good, boys played the game in a relaxed manner. Looking forward to the ODIs, we did well to bounce back and play well in the Test series. We are ready, everyone is upbeat and we are looking to put our best performance forward. Me and Ashish have been working well with the youngsters, our role is to give inputs and ensure things go well in the batting powerplays.Teams:India (Playing XI): Murali Vijay, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Munaf Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ashish NehraSouth Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Colin Ingram, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Johan Botha, Dale Steyn, Wayne Parnell, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo TsotsobeDhoni: The ball will do a bit under the lights, so we would have to restrict them to a decent total. We need some early wickets, it is a good opportunity for the youngsters to create some problems for the selectors. Piyush, Ashwin and Sreesanth miss out.Smith: It is a honour to captain the side and it would be good to win and achieve the record that Hansie achieved. This is the last series where I would be captaining here in SA, I would like to play to the best of my potential. India is a very good team, Robin Peterson and du Plessis miss out.South Africa have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: There will be some moisture underneath the surface, there is some nice grass cover. There are some cracks that would not affect much, the wicket still looks hard and there will be some bounce in the wicket.This will be Sachin Tendulkar's first ODI in 11 months. The last time he sported the blue jersey was when he scored the double hundred at Gwalior in February 2010.There has been some rain around in Durban over the last 24 hours, there is a 33% chance of rain during the course of the day. But, bright and clear skies right now, let's hope that it stays that way.MS Dhoni says 'Toss will be crucial, the ball will do a bit more under the lights'. Considering Dhoni's luck with the toss, the players will surely be keeping their fingers crossed.After an evenly contested Test series and a breath-taking T20, the action shifts to the 50-over format where both teams would get their last chance to get their combination right before the World Cup. No Sehwag and no Gambhir for India, which would probably give Rohit Sharma another chance to catch the eye of the selectors before they name their squads for the WC. This is Ajith and I will take you through the day along with Sid V, Karthik and Pradeep. Stay tuned, we'll be back with more updates.The PreviewSouth Africa and India enter a five-match one-day international series at Kingsmead on Wednesday with at least half an eye on the Cricket World Cup which starts in the sub continent next month.
For both teams it will be the last chance to settle on combinations ahead of the global showpiece in which both have special reasons for wanting to shine. South Africa are yet to reach a World Cup final, despite being among the favourites at every tournament since they surprised the world by reaching the semi-finals in their first appearance in 1992.
This will be Graeme Smith's last chance to lead a winning team in an International Cricket Council event as he will be giving up the one-day captaincy after the World Cup.Speaking at a recent function to mark 50 days to the start of the World Cup, Smith said: "We are looking to make sure we head into the showpiece with the best preparation possible. The series against India will be our last chance to make sure we are fully prepared." At the same function Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni spoke of his dream to lead a successful campaign on home soil, with the final scheduled for Mumbai on April 2. "Every one of us in the Indian dressing room wants to lift that cup, not only for ourselves but also for the billions of fans supporting us around the globe." Although the squads selected for the series in South Africa are unlikely to differ greatly from the final 15-man parties for the World Cup, fringe players in both camps will want to cement their places. The competition for places in the Indian squad is likely to be particularly keen as the tourists have a group of 16 players in South Africa, of whom at least three are likely to miss the World Cup because room will almost certainly be found for three key players, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir and Praveen Kumar, who are not playing in the current series because of injury. The South African selectors will be anxious to see whether Pakistan-born leg-spinner Imran Tahir can take the step up to international level. Tahir, newly eligible for South African selection after acquiring citizenship, has been in prolific form in domestic cricket. He took his total of 42 wickets in the five first-class matches for the Dolphins franchise including a 12-wicket match haul against the Warriors last weekend. Another newcomer seeking to impress is Faf' du Plessis, a free-scoring batsman, athletic fielder and part-time leg- spin bowler who was the leading run-scorer in South Africa's domestic 40-overs competition which ended last month. Although the 14 players in the South African squad have an inside track for World Cup selection they will be well aware that some capable, experienced players, including all-rounders Albie Morkel and Ryan McLaren, could be contenders despite not being picked for the forthcoming series. A batsman from outside the squad who could take advantage if the batting does not fire against India could be Morne van Wyk, who is in the preliminary squad of 30 and top-scored in a Twenty20 international at the Moses Mabhida football stadium on Sunday on a slow, low pitch - conditions more akin to India than is usual for South Africa.
