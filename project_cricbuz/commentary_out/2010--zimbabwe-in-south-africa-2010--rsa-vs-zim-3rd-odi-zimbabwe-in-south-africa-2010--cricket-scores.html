It has been a tough series for Zimbabwe as the South African batsmen have dominated their fragile bowling. South Africa are favourites to make a clean sweep of the series. I am Sid V and I will be bringing you all the action along with my colleague Ajith. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.The Preview by Vishaal LoganathanThe third and final ODI between South Africa and Zimbabwe might be inconsequential in terms of the effect on the series, but both teams will want nothing less than a victory. South Africa will look to press their dominance and extend it against the weaker Zimbabwean side. A clean sweep against the team will be the ideal way for the Proteas to start their summer and they will have to keep their winning habit if they are to succeed against much tougher oppositions in Pakistan and India. Zimbabwe have raised quite a few eyebrows with their fearless cricket, they ran the South Africans close in the T20s and made sure they weren't embarrassed by the Proteas in the first 2 ODIs. The target set in the first ODI was way beyond their reach and they did well to make 287, courtesy of a brilliant 145 by Brendon Taylor. They managed to put up a good total for the South Africans to chase down in the second ODI, but they were undone by the brilliance of Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers.The Zimbabweans have done well to post in excess of 250 on both the occasions and they will be very happy with the way their batting dept has performed in the series so far. It is their bowling that leaves a lot to be desired.Their bowling lacks depth and bite, and against a quality batting line up they gave away too many runs. They will hope to remove inform batsman, Amla early in the 3rd ODI if they are to hope of getting at least one victory before bidding adieu. Shingirai Masakadza has been among wickets for the Zimbabweans but he has been very costly. The Zimbabweans will hope for a much more disciplined bowling effort in the 3rd ODI. The South Africans have found themselves a couple of very handy replacements in the form of Juan Theron and Colin Ingram, who both made full use of their opportunities to put in superb performances in the ODIs. Hashim Amla seems to have hit the form of his life and his twin centuries has ensured the Proteas finished as winner on both the occasions. Colin Ingram, AB de Villiers have also superbly supported the opening batsman and the team look to have no worries in the batting department. The bowlers have done a fair job for the South Africans so far. Juan Theron has been their star and his man of the match effort in the last match, where he accounted for 5 of the Zimbabwean wickets, was richly deserved. The youngster has picked up 8 wickets so far this series and another good show will seem him make a dream start to his career. The others have performed well around him but they would like to limit the Zimbabwean team to lesser scores if they are to think about troubling top Pakistan and Indian batsman in their future series.It all looks set for another South African victory, but having already sealed the series the Proteas will have to be wary of complacency and the ability of the Zimbabweans to spring a surprise of two. For the Zimbabweans, this will be an ideal opportunity to get their confidence and belief up, and they will be going hard at the South Africans hoping for a victory.Teams:South Africa (From): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Johan Botha, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, Jacques Kallis, Charl Langeveldt, David Miller, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Juan Theron, Lonwabo TsotsobeZimbabwe (From): Elton Chigumbura(c), Chamu Chibhabha, Graeme Cremer, Keith Dabengwa, Craig Ervine, Grant Flower, Hamilton Masakadza, Shingirai Masakadza, Chris Mpofu, Ian Nicolson, Ed Rainsford, Tatenda Taibu(w), Brendan Taylor, Prosper Utseya, Sean WilliamsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
