SRI LANKA:0.2 van der Gugten to K Perera, no run, full toss snaking down leg, K Perera does not latch onto it as he clips it straight to the fielder at short fine leg.

K Perera is on strike. van der Gugten will open the attackWow. What a dominant display from Sri Lanka! Netherlands' shot selection was equally poor. The Sri Lankan openers stride out to the middle. You bet that the result is a foregone conclusion though.Mathews: "I loved bowling here. There was some help from the wicket. We just wanted to do the basics right. We started off really well. Even when you play the underdogs, there is pressure. We will try to knock off the runs as quickly as possible."This innings lasted for 63 balls which is the lowest in T20Is. It is now just a matter of how many overs do the Sri Lankan batsmen take to chase this down. Join us in a short while for the run-chase....Well not much to say about the Netherlands batting. They were bamboozled by the Sri Lankan bowlers. Kula started things off as he sent Myburgh out for a duck. Mathews joined in and picked up two in his first over. The Cooper brothers tried to steady things but a mix-up lead to the younger Cooper being run-out. After that it was the Mendis and Malinga show, both outfoxed the batsmen with their variations. They picked up 5 wickets between them and bundled the Dutch for a paltry total of 39.1

NETHERLANDS:9.6 Malinga to Bukhari, out Bowled!! Second in the over for Malinga. Dutch batsmen have no answer to the Sri Lankan bowlers. Another slower full toss on middle and leg, Bukhari stays in the crease and tries to nudge it, the ball deflects off the pads and hits the off-stump.

This is just too good for the Dutch batsmen. van Beek b Malinga 1(4)Malinga to van Beek, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Ben Cooper run out (T Perera) 8(10) [4s-1]A Mendis to Ben Cooper, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!TV umpire called in for a run-out chance. Ben Cooper is the man in question. He seems to be short of his ground.

When we take a look at the outfield, there's not much of dew around. The side winning the toss and bowling first will have an advantage I guess," reckons Nick Knight.Borren: "We would have fielded as well, probably that's been the trend in this tournament. Now we will look to put the runs on the board and do well with the ball. Not much of dew around now, hopefully it doesn't come in largely later on. We are fielding the same side as well."Chandimal: "We will bowl first. The decision is due to the dew factor, it's not too much at the moment but it could come in later on. We are playing the same XI."Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldAlright! They stormed their way into the main tournament with a sensational run chase against Ireland and stunned the cricketing fraternity. What do the Netherlands have in store for us today? Life is not going to be all that easy though for them tonight as they are up against the 2012 finalists, Sri Lanka. Hello and a warm welcome to second game of the double-header. There are few impact players on both the sides, although you would give the favourites tag to the Islanders for their experience in the shortest format. It will be interesting to see the team combinations of both the sides. However, the toss will be delayed as the first game between South Africa and New Zealand went down to the wire. PreviewIt is a typical David v Goliath contest brewing up at Chittagong. Having pulled the rug out of Ireland with a devastating display of batting, Netherlands will go into the match against pre-tournament favourites Sri Lanka with nothing to lose. The island nation themselves will be a confident bunch, after having scraped pat South Africa in their opening league encounter. Sri LankaSri Lanka's dominant batting display against South Africa was a credit to their youngsters in the batting line-up. While the seniors failed to fire, the young turks took it upon themselves to help Sri Lanka reach a competitive score. Kusal Perera took the wheels back to the older times, showing plenty of skills and class, reminiscent of Sanath Jayasuriya in many ways. Angelo Mathews is another pivot in the middle order while the senior brigade have the experience and quality in them to provide direction to the teamIn the bowling department, Lasith Malinga continues to prosper in the shortest form of the game. His package of pace, yorkers and cleverly disguised slower ones have fooled even the best of batsmen at time. Nuwan Kulasekara was expensive to begin with against South Africa, but delivered when it mattered the most, his 19th over was perhaps the turning point of the match. Rangana Herath was surprisingly omitted in favour of mystery spinner, Ajantha Mendis in the first game, and he might as well make a comeback into the playing XI.NetherlandsEntry into the main round of the tournament seemed highly unlikely at one stage for the plucky Dutchmen. With nothing to lose, they threw their bats around in spectacular fashion to leave Ireland stunned and Zimbabwe shocked. Against the big boys in the main draw, the European nation has nothing to lose again and this might make them a dangerous floater. Stephen Myburgh has been a revelation, his clean hitting at the top of the order resulted in wins against UAE and Ireland. Their Australian import, Tom Cooper has held the middle order well while the rest of the batsmen have chipped in with handy runs. If there is any weakness in this team it is the lack of wicket taking bowlers. Timm van der Gugten has shown plenty of potential while Ahsan Malik has done well in the death overs. Logan van Beek has been expensive, and might struggle to retain his place.Keys to winThe no-holds barred attitude of the top-order batsmen, if it comes good, then the team can either post a big score and chase down totals with ease.StatsThe leading run-scorer of the tournament with 151 runs so far, Tom Cooper is clearly proving why Netherlands got him into the side as a last minute replacement for Tom Gruitjers.Quotes:We are very proud to represent the Associates here and we hope to do the other countries proud: Netherlands captain, Peter Borren knows what it is to make the main draw of the tournament.We never underestimate any ream, we will play our best eleven and look to win: Sri Lankan captain, Dinesh Chandimal is not under-estimating the associate nation.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Rangana Herath, Seekkuge Prasanna, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru ThirimanneNetherlands (From): Peter Borren(c), Stephan Myburgh, Wesley Barresi(w), Logan van Beek, Tom Cooper, Ben Cooper, Michael Swart, Mudassar Bukhari, Timm van der Gugten, Pieter Seelaar, Ahsan Malik, Eric Szwarczynski, Tom Heggelman, Vivian Kingma, Michael RipponLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
