Join us in a few minutes for the reply....Zimbabwe have done extremely well to bowl out the Proteas. This is only the third time that they have achieved the feat in ODI's. The spinners have to be given all the credit. The spin trio of Nyumbu, Utseya and Williams shared 6 wickets between them. They also didn't concede too many runs.

There is no grass covering here, it is a hard wicket. There are only a few cracks. It will be marginally quicker than the one in the first ODI. The ball will spin well. Win toss, bowl first kind of a wicket.The weather here is warm with clear skies. Zimbabwe are likely to make a couple of changes to the side and be more competitive; while South Africa are already at their full strength. Toss and teams heading your way in a few minutes. Stay tuned....They might be the underdogs, but both in the one-off Test as well the first ODI, Zimbabwe have shown the spirit to take on the World No. 1 team. Their bowling suffered when the visitors smashed 309/3 in the previous game but the middle-order put up quite a fight while chasing it down. The question now is - can they take the battle a bit further?
