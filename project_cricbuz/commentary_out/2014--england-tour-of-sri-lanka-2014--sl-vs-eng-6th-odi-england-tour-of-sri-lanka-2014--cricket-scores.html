Well, the ball pitched outside leg and Root escapes. For such cases, they should have a look at the Hawk-Eye first and then have multiple replays/angles to see if bat/glove was involved. Absolute waste of time.

Two slips in place.The umpires are making their way out to the middle, followed by the England team.Cook: 'We would have bowled first anyway. We had a good game here in the last match and will look to continue in the same manner. We are playing an unchanged eleven.'Mathews: 'We will bat first. Looks like a good track, it might take some turn later on, but not much as the last game. We shouldn't put pressure on ourselves. Three changes for us. We are trying out a few combinations.'Pitch Report: 'It looks like an even surface, hardly any grass on that. There will be some moisture but should ease down as the day goes on. The captain winning the toss may bat first, a total around 250-260 will be very competitive,' reckons Russel ArnoldThis is also Mahela Jayawardene's final appearence at Pallekele and hometown hero, Kumar Sangakkara's final ODI in front of his home crowd. An emotional moment for both legends of Sri Lanka.Teams:England (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Joe Root, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, Steven FinnSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Seekkuge Prasanna, Sachithra Senanayake, Suranga LakmalThree changes for Sri Lanka. Dinesh Chandimal, Seekkuge Prasanna and Suranga Lakmal are in. They replace Kushal Perera, Ajantha Mendis and Dhammika Prasad. On the other hand, England are unchanged.Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batHello and welcome to game 6 of the 7-match ODI series. We are still in Pallekele and there is some rain forecast for later in the day, but currently, the conditions are good enough for a prompt start. England batted exceptionally well in the rain-marred 5th ODI a couple of days ago. Joe Root and James Taylor showed great class, despite operating on a difficult pitch. Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews said that he was disappointed with his bowlers in the last game. The series is poised nicely at the moment. Sri Lanka are leading 3-2 and England, who are high on confidence, will look to keep the series alive with a win today. The hosts have dropped Ajantha Mendis and Kusal Perera for the last two ODIs. It will be interesting to see who will be their replacements in the playing XI. There is a lot to look forward to, toss and more coming up in a short while...PreviewOverview:The series stays at Pallekele in Kandy for the sixth game. A win for England would take the series into a decider at Colombo. After the fourth One-Day International at Colombo, many expected England to be rolled over at Pallekele, but it wasn't to be. Chris Woakes, Joe Root and James Taylor gave England enough reasons to believe that their ODI team is capable, even in typical subcontinent conditions. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will hope to iron out the minor chinks from the last game and wrap the series up.England:A lot of things went right in the last game for England. Despite Tillakaratne Dilshan getting off to a brisk start, they never really allowed the game to get away from them. At the end, they were successful in restricting Sri Lanka to a just about par-score. Chris Woakes has emerged to become a more than useful bowling all-rounder. Despite his failure in the last game, Moeen Ali along with James Taylor and Joe Root, has been consistent in notching up scores. All three of Joe Root's centuries in 2014 have resulted in England victories. However, the calls for Alastair Cook's head from the ODI team have only strengthened. He would hope to shake off the unusually long period of bad form and put in a significant contribution.Sri Lanka:Sri Lanka haven't won a game outside Colombo in the series. They will now have to do it with a new opening combination after Kusal Perera was dropped for the final two games. In all probability, Mahela Jayawardene will be pushed up the order to open with Dilshan. The returning Dinesh Chandimal is expected to fill a place in the middle-order. Despite Sachitra Senanayake getting early breakthroughs, Sri Lankan spinners were unable to exploit the dry surface on offer at Pallekele. Ajantha Mendis has been left out of the squad and the team management hint at the possible inclusion of the uncapped chinaman bowler, Lakshan Sandakan.Weather and Conditions:The organisers' decision to have reserve days for games was finally justified when a torrential downpour at Pallekele caused the England chase to be played on the reserve day. The forecast in Kandy has intermittent showers for tomorrow. This, however, is a day game and could see the game getting completed. Should it not, there is a reserve day.Statistics:Kumar Sangakkara continues to defy the law of averages. His 91st ODI fifty in the last game puts him only five behind table-topper Sachin Tendulkar, who has 96.Quotes:"He reminds me of Scrappy from Scooby-Doo ... he's always nagging at your heels."Joe Root on batting with James Taylor.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Joe Root, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, Steven Finn, Ben Stokes, Harry Gurney, Alex Hales, Ian BellSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Dhammika Prasad, Ajantha Mendis, Shaminda Eranga, Suranga Lakmal, Lakshan Rangika, Ashan Priyanjan, Dilruwan Perera, Lahiru Gamage, Thilina KandambyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
