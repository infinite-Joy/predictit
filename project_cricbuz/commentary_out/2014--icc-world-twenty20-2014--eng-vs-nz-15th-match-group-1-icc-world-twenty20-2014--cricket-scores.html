ENGLAND:0.1 Mills to Lumb, 1 run, starts with a straight one on the pads, Lumb clips it to deep square leg and gets off the markLumb and Hales are at the crease. Lumb is on strike. Mills will open the attackMills to kick start things in the second game. One slip in place....National anthems of both teams are played out. After a cracking first game we can assume that this game too has all the makings of a thriller. The Kiwis are in a huddle and Brendon is seen giving them a pep talk. The England openers walk out to the middle.The build-up to the World T20 championship has been quite patchy for England. They have lost 7 of their last 8 T20 Internationals. Could tonight turn out to be a fresh start for the Poms? To add to their woes, Luke Wright has been ruled out of the tourney with a side strain just hours before the start of this clash.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Brendon McCullum(c), Ross Taylor, Colin Munro, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghanEngland (Playing XI): Michael Lumb, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad(c), James Tredwell, Jade DernbachBroad: "We have had some injury problems. But we have been training hard for the last 3 weeks so we are looking forward to it. We would have also bowled but in T20 cricket if you get a good score you can't say what happens. We can adapt by seeing how New Zealand go about on this wicket."McCullum: "We have been preparing for this tournament for quite sometime. We will look to start off well. We will bowl first. It is because of the dew and the ball comes on better later on. Neesham, Hira, Boult and Devcich miss out."New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe toss will be delayed slightly as the first game between Sri Lanka and South Africa went down to the wire, with the former holding their nerve to clinch the thriller.
