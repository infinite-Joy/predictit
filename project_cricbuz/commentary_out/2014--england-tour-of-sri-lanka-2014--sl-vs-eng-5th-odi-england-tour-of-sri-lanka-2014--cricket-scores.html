Good start for Cook and EnglandCook and Moeen Ali are at the crease. Cook is on strike. Dilshan will open the attackSri Lanka are starting with spin. It's Dilshan, who'll start proceedings. He has one slip in place.Alright, the players are making their way out to the middle. Play about to begin.The fact that they have three spinners in Sachithra Senanayake, Ajantha Mendis and Jeevan Mendis will make them feel confident of defending 239. This will be a real test for Alastair Cook & Co. The target is not too big, but the pitch is very tricky to bat on. The action will begin in a short while, stay tuned...Welcome back to Day 2 of this rain-marred 5th ODI at Pallekele. The good news is that it is bright and sunny currently at the ground. Former England cricketer David Llyod tweeted earlier that the conditions are quite hot and the pitch is ultra dry. Yesterday, the ball was turning square and even the likes of Kumar Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews found the going very tough. Sri Lanka's spinners will be itching to get their hands on the ball.Well, we will all have to come back and complete this match tomorrow. The match will continue from where it was left off. There will be an extra hour of allowance for rain but the match has to get over by 7 PM local time latest. Do join us for the second part of the match. For now, cheers and bye..This was imminent. Play has been abandoned for the day. Both teams will resume action at 2:30 PM local time tomorrow with England needing to chase down 240 from 50 overs. Tomorrow's play can be extended by an hour if rain intervenes.The umpires are out for an inspection. I assume they will call off the match for today. It is still raining though..We are closing in on the cut-off time. With rain imminent, Sri Lanka Cricket scheduled as many as 5 matches with reserve days. Pallekele had plenty of rain over the past week and has returned with England all set to chase the target down. Looks like they must wait until tomorrow afternoon for the chase..Nothing new to report.. It is still raining in Pallekele.. The wait continues..The rain has just got heavier.. Chances of resumption today looks pretty bleak..Roshan Abeysinghe has tweeted that rain has got harder and he reckons that the reserve day might come into effect.The ground-staff reckon they need an hour to get the ground ready after it stops raining. If play resumes tomorrow, it will be at 2:30 PM local time and it will start from where we left off..It's still raining in Pallekele. The cut-off time for a 20-over chase is 9:55 PM. However, we do have a reserve day tomorrow. For a 20-over chase, the target will be 148 under the D/L method.Now, the entire ground has been covered. Credit to Sri Lanka's ground-staff for ensuring that not much time is wasted once it stops raining.. For now, it's lashing down in Pallekele.. A prompt resumption looks bleak..The clouds were threatening and it has finally started to rain. The entire square has been covered. Hopefully, it will just be a passing shower..However, Jordan forced Mathews to top-edge one and since then, Woakes turned it on and picked up five wickets to rattle the hosts, after accounting for Jayawardene earlier in the day. He also becomes the first English bowler to take a 6-fer twice in ODIs. England employed 25 overs of spin and you can expect more from Sri Lanka. A very interesting chase is on the cards. Hopefully, the rain doesn't play spoilsport. Take a break and be right back here in a short while.Chris Woakes, who is the first English bowler to take 5 wickets or more in ODIs in Sri Lanka, leads England off the field. 239 is a pretty good score on a surface that is willing to assist if you opt to take pace off the ball and England will have to bat really well to pull this off. The hosts rode on Sangakkara's great batting show to post a sizeable total. Things weren't looking great for Sri Lanka at 59/3, but the 86-run fourth wicket stand between captain Mathews and Sanga steadied the ship.4
