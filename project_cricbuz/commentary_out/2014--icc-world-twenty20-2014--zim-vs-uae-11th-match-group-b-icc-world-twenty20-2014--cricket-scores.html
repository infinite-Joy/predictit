Remember, Zimbabwe will have to crush UAE to nurture hopes of a back door entry into the Super 10s.The Zimbabwean bowlers have answered their captain's call and have restricted UAE to 116. The UAE batsmen never got going, they lost two quick wickets and were on the back foot. Khurram and Patil added 58 runs for the third wicket, but once they were dismissed, all went downhill. None of the other batters applied themselves. The spinners were at their best for Zimbabwe. Williams and Raza shared 5 wickets between them. It is now upto their batsmen to chase the target down with 27-30 balls to spare if they are to gain a better run-rate than Ireland. Join us back in a short while for the run-chase..1

We are a young team and have to keep improving with each game. The batsmen have got starts but have not converted it into big ones. The pitch looks like 140 wicket, so we will try to put up a competetive total on the board. We have two changes, Guruge and Silva are playing."Brendon Taylor: "We have been sloppy with our fielding. Hopefully, we can correct that today and play some good cricket. We are going to bowl. We need to know what we are going to chase. If the bowlers can give us a good start, then it will be upto the batters to chase it down. We are playing the same team."Pitch Report: "The wicket looks dry and hard. There was nothing in it for the seamers. The spinners will be the key on this turf. The captain that wins the toss will want to bowl first", says Jonty RhodesZimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldHanging onto the second position in the points table, Zimbabwe find themselves in a do-or-die situation today.
