There will be three powerplays with the mandatory one being 8 overs, and the other two, 4 overs each. Each bowler will be allowed a maximum of 8 overs.Gentle reminder: Since the time is past 7:30 PM local time, there will be reduction in overs. Infact Mohandas Menon has just tweeted : Bangladesh will have to make 212 runs in 40 oversRoshan Abeysinghe on Twitter: 2nd inspection at 7.45. May be an 8 o clock start with around 11 overs reduced.Update at 18:17 IST, 18:47 local time: There will be an inspection in half an hour. If the conditions are satisfactory, play will begin at 19:00 IST, i.e. 19:30 local time.Some good news coming in from Dhaka. The covers are coming off now.Latest news (17:58 IST, 18:28 local time): The rain has stopped and the super-sopper is at work. Play could begin soonIf the 2nd innings doesn't go beyond 20 overs then it will continue tomorrow on the reserve day. If it does go beyond 20 overs and it rains then obviously the result will be decided by Duckworth-Lewis. As of now it is still raining heavily at MirpurThat does it then. Bangladesh will be mighty pleased with their efforts with the ball. They kept picking up wickets and never really let Sri Lanka get on top. The visitors started off on the wrong note losing three quick wickets. They were then helped by a solid partnership between Kapugedara and Thirimanne. Tharanga played a good cameo but at the end of it no one really capitalized on their starts and Bangladesh restricted their opposition to nothing more than a chaseable score. The sad thing for the hosts though is that the rain has begun to come down heavily now and the covers are on. Stay with us for updates on the same and lets hope that the 2nd innings might be able to start without much delay4

The explosive opening pair of Mahela and Dilshan are out in the middle.In a pressure match, would Bangladesh have been better to bat first after winning the toss? Have your sayTeams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Chamara Kapugedera, Upul Tharanga, Farveez Maharoof, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith Malinga, Suranga LakmalBangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Nazimuddin, Jahurul Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Shakib Al Hasan, Nasir Hossain, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Nazmul Hossain, Shahadat HossainMahela: It is not that difficult to motivate the team. All the teams will like to chase on this track, but we need to put runs on the board. We have made 2 changes. Chandimal woke up with a bad stomach and has been ruled out. Sachitra Senanayake is in. Chamara Kapugedera will also get a game.Mushfiqur: We will bowl. We have chased well in this tournament and we will look to restrict them. We are confident about our abilities. Nazmul Hossain is in for the injured Shafiul.Bangladesh have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report:  Rain has been predicted later on in the day. The pitch looks very good for batting, but the outfield might be slow. It will be a difficult decision for the team winning the toss, reckons Sunil GavaskarWelcome to one and all for this enthralling clash between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The home team will be desparate for a win and will know that a victory here would catapult them into the final. Sri Lanka on the other hand have just pride to play for since they cannot make it to the final now, however, sometimes pride in itself can act as a voracious motivating factor. It looks set for a nail biter with the hosts in good form, so sit back and enjoy the cricket that is set to unfold at Mirpur.Sri Lanka are out of the tournament and will be keen on leaving Bangladesh with at least a win under their belts while the Bangladeshi's will go all-out for another upset and get their place in the finals. Gokul who is confident that SL will leave with a win and Sid V who is fervently hoping for Bdesh to play in the finals face-off. Gokul: Bangladesh may have handled the Indian bowling line-up pretty easily. But do they have it in them to go up against Lasith Malinga? Sid V: The potent Malinga is a thing of the past. He is not getting the yorker right and so he is easy to handle. Malinga is still dangerous, but he is nowhere close to his best. He is only good in the IPL, where his yorkers are surprisingly on target. The rest of the bowling line-up? The less said about them the better. No variety and no consistency. It is like the SL team can bat but they can't bowl and field well. Gokul: Bangladesh have exceeded expectations with their performance in this Asia Cup, no doubting that. But how long can they sustain it? Sid V: There have been a lot of starts and stops in Bangladesh's cricketing journey. If a team like Bangladesh gets on a roll, they are very difficult to beat. They showed it in the 2007 World Cup, where they defeated some big nations along the way. Similarly in the 2011 World Cup, they defeated England. They were on a roll when they whitewashed New Zealand 4-0 as well as defeated Zimbabwe 3-1. Looking at their recent thrashing of India, they look like emerging out of a defeatist attitude and putting in a consistent show. Gokul: Indians might have batted slowly against Bangladesh, but don't expect Dilshan, Mahela and Sangakkara to go quiet. The Bangla bowlers will have an uphill task trying to stop the dangerous trio? Sid V: Dilshan always has had a brain explosion. His tendency to over-attack will lead to his downfall. Mahela and Sangakkara are class players no doubt, but Bangladesh's spinners can contain them and frustrate them into making a mistake. The SL top order are totally over-reliant on these three and that adds more pressure on them. If the moment is seized by Bangladesh, then the trio can be easily put down Sid V: Bangladesh are heading into the match after thumping India, something Sri Lanka have failed to do. What will it take for Sri Lanka to register a win? Gokul: Sri Lankans are entering the final match of the league stage with nothing to lose. With India having won against Pakistan, Sri Lanka are out of the tournament and will look to go out with a bang. So, this will be the match where they'll launch an all-out attack and tame the so called 'Tigers'. Sid V: The world calls us minnows. But, Sri Lanka's performance in the Asia Cup could make even the minnows proud? How will Sri Lanka cope up? Gokul: They might have had two failures but don't expect a third from a world class side like the Lankans. How will Lanka cope - how they have over the years while beating world class sides time and again. Sid V: Sri Lanka have failed to reach the finals and the main problem is their lacklustre bowling line-up. How did they think they could come out victors in the Asia Cup with such a pedestrian bowling line-up? Gokul: There is nothing pedestrian about the Lankan bowling. The sight of Lasith Malinga will send shivers down the Bangladeshi batsmen. Suranga Lakmal too is a effective bowler and so are Kulasekara and Maharoof. So to answer your question, Sri Lanka's bowling is armed enough to deliver a comprehensive win. Sid V: So far, the lowest total posted in the Asia Cup has been from Sri Lanka, for a team relying heavily on its batsmen they have thus far been poor. With the finals out of reach, will they finally come good? Gokul: FYI, Sangakkara and Tharanga scored fine half-centuries against Pakistan in between collapses. Against India too, Sangakkara did well along with Mahela. Not to mention, Dilshan is due for a big score and Sri Lanka also have talented youngsters like Chandimal and Thirimmane. So the Bangladeshi bowlers better be up for battering.
