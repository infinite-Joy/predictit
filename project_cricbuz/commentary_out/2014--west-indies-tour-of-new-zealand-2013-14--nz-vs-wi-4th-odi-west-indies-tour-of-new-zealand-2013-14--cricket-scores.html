And yes, there are some rains predicted for this game as well. Hopefully, it proves the weather forecasters wrong and we get a full game in. Team compositions along with toss coming up soon. Stay tuned.....Hello and welcome to the fourth ODI at Nelson. The series is level at 1-1 and both teams would want to go one up today. Last match saw records being broken as the hosts started the year with a bang. They will look to take that momentum into this game. The batsmen have been in some form with Ryder, McCullum, Taylor and Anderson all among some runs. The visitors will have to regroup from the thrasing they received and move on quickly. They will once again miss some of their key members like Darren Sammy and Darren Bravo.Preview:Suddenly, a bilateral ODI series being played out in New Zealand has started to garner a lot of interest. Just for the record, New Zealand and West Indies are tied on 1-1, after three games.West Indies had promised to fight back after losing the Test series 0-2, when they chalked out a dramatic two-wicket win in the first ODI while the second was washed out by rain. The third match, played on New Years day, saw Corey Anderson smash a 36-ball century, breaking Shahid Afridi's record for the fastest ODI hundred and Jesse Ryder crack the sixth fastest off 46 balls. Needless to say, West Indies were flattened.New Zealand:When you have two batsmen scoring centuries in less than 50 balls each and the team blasts 283 off 21 overs at nearly 14 an over, the world seems to be at your feet. New Zealand, having come back to draw level in the series will be mighty confident and the West Indies for obvious reasons, would be feeling deflated. The Kiwis have everything going for them after another disappointing tour of Bangladesh. They clobbered the West Indies in the Test series, ran them close after being bundled out cheaply in the first ODI and then had Corey Anderson and Jesse Ryder breathe fire with the bat on January 1.New Zealand's bowlers were impressive too for they did not let the West Indies batsmen get away to a strong start and threw cold water over their hopes with some tight, incisive bowling. The momentum will certainly be with the hosts, going into the fourth game in Nelson and don't be surprised if Anderson threatens to push the boundaries of quick scoring further.Key Players:There are plenty of good limited overs cricketers in the New Zealand team but at the moment, Anderson and Ryder are overwhelming favourites to send the West Indian bowlers on another wild leather hunt. Such was Anderson's impact, that not much has been spoken of Ryder's brutal hitting. It is not everyday that a batsman turns up and slams a ton off 46 balls after recovering from serious injuries and overcoming other problems. These two batsmen will be on top of the agenda in the West Indian team meeting before the game.West Indies:Chris Gayle's absence has been a major blow for the West Indies. His mere presence in the batting line-up sends shivers down bowling ranks and the visitors have clearly failed to fill that void. The defeat in the Test series, a successful but stressful chase in a low scorer in the ODI series and then the implosion in the third ODI point to a general lack of effort from the other batsmen. That is something they will need to correct in Nelson.The bowlers would have needed some psychological assistance too. Ravi Rampaul was taken apart for 64 off 3 overs! That says enough. When the strike bowler leaks as many, albeit on a flat pitch and a small ground, the captain will have cause for concern.Key Players:Dwayne Bravo continues to be West Indies' most dependable cricketer. The man can bat and bowl with equal aplomb and make a difference. Bravo is a charismatic leader, who will not shy away from motivating his troops - he would want to ensure that they win the series, that they do not go into the final ODI looking to merely draw 2-2. The fourth game will be as much a test of his skills as a cricketer as it will be of his leadership.Numbers:14.93: Sunil Narine's bowling average against New Zealand in OD
NEW ZEALAND:14.93: Sunil Narine's bowling average against New Zealand in ODIs. 7: The number of fifers taken in New Zealand-West Indies ODIs till date.Weather: This game will be the first men's international match to be hosted at the Saxton Oval. Rain has been a constant threat in this ODI series but going by the weather forecast, there will not be much for the 4th ODI although it will remain mostly cloudy in Nelson on Saturday.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Brendon McCullum(c), Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Adam Milne, James Neesham, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghan, Tim Southee, Kane Williamson, Colin MunroWest Indies (From): Johnson Charles, Lendl Simmons, Chadwick Walton, Kieran Powell, Dwayne Bravo(c), Narsingh Deonarine, Denesh Ramdin(w), Sunil Narine, Nikita Miller, Jason Holder, Ravi Rampaul, Darren Sammy, Tino Best, Kirk EdwardsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
