Starc will open the attackStarc starts with two slips in place..Welcome back.. England failed to seize the advantage and let the Australian middle-order run amok. That has left their batsmen to score 279 runs for a title triumph. Can they chase it down or will Johnson, Starc and Co. roll them over?During the last Ashes, England seemed to be in a trance like state facing Johnson. Has anything changed from then? The pressure of chasing in a final will be playing on England's mind too. Can they handle it? We'll find out soon. Back soon after a short break.Maxwell was all unorthodoxy, while Marsh supported him well, choosing the right ball to hit. Maxwell once again missed out on a hundred and a moment of madness from Haddin ran Marsh out. England were right back in it and harboured hopes of restricting Australia to around 255-260. But Faulkner showed why he is such a feared hitter as he finished off the innings with a brilliant late hitting show. Faulkner's innings also once again demonstrated Australia's depth with the bat. 278 on this WACA track won't be easy to chase down against Johnson, Starc and Co.That late blitz from Faulkner might well prove to be the difference once the second innings is done. A few downbeat Englishmen as they go back to the dressing room. England started so well, taking three wickets and putting the pressure on Smith to make a big score. Smith looked set to do just that, but he was outsmarted by Moeen Ali. At that stage, it looked a tough ask for Australia to reach 250. But Maxwell and Marsh put on a fine stand of over 100 which brought the innings back on track.4

Hopefully, the wicket will quicken in the afternoon and the quicks will make use of it. It looks like an interesting wicket. Shane Watson is still not fit but he is getting close to being fully fit. It is more of a precautionary measure. Mitchell Johnson is back in the side and absolutely happy about it. David Warner is doing well too."Eoin Morgan: "We will bowl first. We are unsure what the wicket is going to do. Hopefully we can do what we did the other day. It got better as the day went on. Our side is doing well. It is a strong squad. We are unchanged. The opportunity to play the final against Australia is good. We have guys who have proved themselves earlier on the tour. Great venue to play the final at."England have won the toss and have opted to fieldEngland have named an unchanged side.England Cricket have tweeted: Overcast morning in Perth & hopefully we see no further rain! The boys getting ready for #triseries final #AusvEngEngland have defeated Australia in five out of seven games at Perth, a stat, the visitors will take confidence from. Can they uphold the tradition before the mega tournament kick-starts? Only time will tell. We will bring you the toss and team updates shortly. Don't go anywhere...Meanwhile, Australia have not put a foot wrong so far. They are the only team to have remained unbeaten in the tournament and delivered consistently. The icing on the cake today would be Mitchell Johnson's return to the side, his first game of the series. The bouncy WACA wicket will play the perfect host to re-launch a fit and thoroughly rested Johnson, something the English would be undeniably wary of. Despite the absence of Michael Clarke, the team looks dangerous and settled. Mitchell Starc has come of age and given the hosts enviable starts in the competition. Steve Smith and David Warner have been ruthless with the bat. Shane Watson, who is nursing a slight hamstring niggle, will continue to sit out. For the hosts, it is just a matter of settling on a perfect combination.For England, this series has been a realization of sorts. The new year brought them a new captain, under whose leadership they have begun to get back on track. Against India, they put up a brilliant bowling display, trouncing the sub-continent team with ease. Steve Finn, James Anderson and Chris Woakes form an intimidating attack, their only worry being Stuart Broad's lack of form. Moeen Ali has provided them with breakthroughs at crucial junctures. On the other hand, their batting looks solid and composed. James Taylor has proved himself with mature knocks and performed admirably so far. Bell, Morgan, Buttler, all have chipped in with valuable runs and backed their bowlers.After two weeks of intense cricket, arch-rivals Australia and England will be battling each other in what might be called as a dress rehearsal of their opening game in the 2015 World Cup. A win here will be a significant confidence booster for both teams. Although Australia defeated England twice in the preliminary stage of the competition, the latter have shown a great deal of fight. The first game of the tri-series was one-sided, as Australia won with a bonus point. In comparison, their second game was a much closer affair, with the hosts crossing the line with only one ball to spare.Preview by Siddharth VishwanathanBefore heading into the tri-series in Australia, England were staring down the barrel when it came to ODIs. They had lost four out of five ODI series in 2014 and the string of poor results had resulted in Alastair Cook getting sacked as ODI skipper. There was uncertainty heading into the tri-series and there were issues regarding the team's composition and confidence. However, England are turning the corner under Eoin Morgan's leadership. Although they struggled against Australia, their performance against India has been wonderful, with wins in Brisbane and Perth. England will be aiming to go one step better and win the tournament in order to gain significant confidence ahead of the World Cup.Australia will be getting a chance to tick all the right boxes and finalise their combination. The team would have looked at the Perth wicket during the India - England clash and smiled. After playing on docile pitches for close to three months, they have a chance to bowl on a wicket that has pace and variable bounce.Team newsAustraliaThe bowling will be the main focus in the final. Mitchell Johnson, who missed the Sydney Test due to a sore hamstring and was rested for the first four ODIs, is refreshed after a break and it will be interesting to see whether he can repeat the heroics against England in 2013/14. "It's a big match to come into, but I'm as prepared as I can be," Johnson was quoted. Mitchell Starc has been in fabulous form in this series and his record at the venue, with 12 wickets in three games at an average of 8.50, makes him a difficult proposition. Coach Darren Lehmann has confirmed that Shane Watson will be out due to injury and Mitchell Marsh will feature in the final.Probable XI1 David Warner, 2 Aaron Finch, 3 Steven Smith, 4 George Bailey (c), 5 Mitchell Marsh, 6 Glenn Maxwell, 7 Brad Haddin (wk), 8 James Faulkner, 9 Mitchell Johnson, 10 Mitchell Starc, 11 Josh HazlewoodEnglandJames Taylor has enhanced his reputation immensely in this tournament. With 143 runs, with two fifties and at an average of 47.66 , Taylor has provided stability to the middle order. His knock of 82 against India in Perth came when England were 66/5 and his 125-run stand with Jos Buttler helped England ease into the final. Ian Bell, Morgan and Buttler have all contributed with the bat in this series but will aim consistency. Steven Finn, whose career was at the crossroads after being sent back from Australia in 2013/14 due to poor form, has redeemed himself with 10 wickets at an average of 18.2. His hostile pace and bounce will be vital on a lively surface.Probable XI1 Ian Bell, 2 Moeen Ali, 3 James Taylor, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan (c), 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Jos Buttler (wk), 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Stuart Broad, 10 James Anderson, 11 Steven FinnStatsIn the last 12 ODIs between Australia and England, Australia have won eight and lost two, with two matches ending in no-results.In the last seven ODIs played by England in Perth, they have won five matches and lost two.LATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
