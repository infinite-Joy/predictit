We are playing 2 fast bowlers and 1 medium-fast bowlers."Pitch Report: "The wicket is pretty hard and the ball will come on to the bat nicely. There is a bit of green tinge on the wicket, but it's been nicely rolled in," reckons Rameez Raja.Hong Kong have won the toss and have opted to batIt's a do-or-die game for both Afghanistan and Hong Kong having lost opening games to Bangladesh and Nepal respectively. Who will get the better of whom? Time will tell us. A warm welcome to the third day of the first round games. Afghanistan, who have been quite impressive in international cricket of late, will be looking forward to do well and stay alive in the tournament. Hong Kong on the other hand, though tagged as the best side on paper, couldn't quite live up to their reputaion against Nepal as their batting line-up collapsed dramatically. Skipper Atkinson stated in the post-match presentation that his side is capable of bouncing back. It will be interesting to see the playing XI of both the sides, toss and more coming up your way in a short while.Teams:Afghanistan (From): Mohammad Nabi(c), Dawlat Zadran, Aftab Alam, Karim Sadiq, Mohammad Shahzad(w), Najibullah Zadran, Samiullah Shenwari, Shapoor Zadran, Asghar Stanikzai, Gulbadin Naib, Hamza Hotak, Mirwais Ashraf, Najeeb Taraki, Nawroz Mangal, Shafiqullah ShafiqHong Kong (From): James Atkinson(w/c), Waqas Barkat, Aizaz Khan, Mark Chapman, Ehsan Nawaz, Haseeb Amjad, Babar Hayat, Irfan Ahmed, Roy Lamsam, Munir Dar, Nadeem Ahmed, Najeeb Amar, Nizakat Khan, Kinchit Shah, Tanwir AfzalLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
