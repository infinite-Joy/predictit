Dhawan is on strike. McKay will open the attackA daunting task lies ahead for Team India, the players are walking out. Will the dew work in the favour of the Indians? Will the young guns step up to the big occasion? Or will the Australian bowlers come up with a spirited performance and help them win their first game of this tour? Stay tuned as the second half of the match gets underway.The last 5 overs produced 84 runs as White ran riot. It will be a stiff chase for the Indian side when they come out to bat.Absolute carnage towards the end has seen Australia score 114 runs off the last 10 overs! Michael Clarke has led from the front to help Australia ease into a commanding position, a total which looked a distant dream when they were 16/2 at one stage. Hussey gave him tremendous support by scoring a timely fifty. The Indians let the pressure slip in the middle overs by conceding easy runs with some sloppy fielding. White helped Australia tee off in style towards the end with some lusty hitting, getting past his fifty in just 38 balls. Remember India are fielding 2 debutants - Dhawan and Tiwary so the pressure would firmly rest on Yuvraj, Raina and Dhoni to deliver. Can they chase this down with ease or will it go down to the wire? Dew may also have a part to play as we progress into the innings. Join us at 6:45 IST for the run-chase.4

It has been a tough Test series, we would like to bounce back in this format. Starc and Hastings make their debut while Bollinger, Ferguson and Warner miss out.Dhoni: We have left out Ravindra Jadeja, so our part timers should bowl the 10 overs. We have two youngsters making their debut. Dhawan and Tiwary have been given an opportunity. As international cricketers we need to play as many matches as possible, when you go to a venue and if there is no match you do get bored and frustrated. So it is good to see the sun shining out here at Vizag.India have won the toss and elected to fieldThe captains are in the middle with the match referee, the toss is underway. New jerseys for Team India.Australia have left out David Warner, they are going in with Shaun Marsh. Interesting!Brad Hogg: Cricketers would love these conditions, you have to be hydrated, the players have to keep their energy intact. When a batsman comes in first up, the bowlers have to vary the length, make the batsmen move their feet and test him with short stuff or make him drive. Starc and Hastings are the two new comers in the Aussie side.Pitch report: Hot and humid conditions says Ravi Shastri, the wicket is flat and this is the first day-nighter at this venue. The previous games played here have been high scoring games, the ball will come on to the bat. The bowlers will have to vary their pace on this wicket. The team that wins the toss may think about fielding considering the fact that there may be some dew later on in the evening.Weather update: Live pictures show us clear blue skies, it is bright and sunny out there at Vizag.Hello and welcome one and all. After a washout at Kochi, the action shifts to Visakhapatnam for the 2nd of this 3 match ODI series. It is the battle of relatively two inexperienced sides, with the absence of star players. Will India take the initiative and take the lead in this shortened series or will Australia show us what they are really made of? This is Ajith and I will bring you all the action along with my colleagues Shashank, Sid V and Srivathsa. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates....Preview by Saurabh SomaniThe wash-out of the first One Day International between India and Australia means that the tour has effectively become a 2-Test and 2-ODI tour - not the ideal format for any kind of tour. However, both India and Australia will have to make the best of conditions as they are. Winning this match, of course, has become vital for both teams.Both sides will have one eye firmly trained on the 2011 World Cup, and both have rested some of their key players so that the ideal combination from amongst the fringe players can be worked out.The team that wears the India blue on Wednesday will be a very different one than what most fans are used to seeing. Missing in action are Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Ishant Sharma. The young Indian team that will take the field thus, will be hampered by a considerable lack of experience. On the other hand, young minds make for free thought, and a more vibrant atmosphere. Getting the mix of youth and experience right will be amongst the top priorities of MS Dhoni and Gary Kirsten. One man whose inclusion will be keenly watched is Yuvraj Singh. There is no doubting Yuvraj's talent, but there is also no doubting that he hasn't been the best cricketer he could be, with the principal reason behind that being his attitude. If he manages to get his head and form right, he would be an automatic inclusion in most team's starting elevens, and this will be his chance to prove detractors wrong. The long rope that the selectors have given him is already starting to wear thin, as the axing from the Test squad indicated, and that should be motivation enough for Yuvraj to come out firing.It is also a great opportunity for the likes of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Saurabh Tiwary, Murali Vijay and R Ashwin to stake their claims for a World Cup spot. Tiwary has been part of the squad but not got a game, while Ashwin has impressed in the few opportunities he has had. Amongst the top order, Kohli's stats are the most impressive, and Murali Vijay's Test and T20 form make him a better candidate than Rohit - who has had umpteen opportunities but never quite grabbed them.The bowling has Nehra and Praveen Kumar as the experienced campaigners. Being the sole spinner in the side, Ashwin is almost certain to play and the third seamer's role will be decided between Munaf Patel and Vinay Kumar. With Dhoni, Raina and Yuvraj also certain to play, there are four slots left with six youngsters - Vijay, Rohit, Kohli, Tiwary, Dhawan and Jadeja - to fill them.Though Australia are also without some key players, it should be remembered that they thrashed India 4-2 a year ago when they also had a very inexperienced side. In Michael Clarke, Cameron White, Doug Bollinger, Nathan Hauritz and Michael Hussey they have experienced men, while there are exciting youngsters in the form of David Warner, Callum Ferguson and Steven Smith. Warner and Ferguson in particular, will be the men to watch. While Warner's explosive ability has been well showcased in T20s, he has gone on record saying that he wants to establish himself in other formats, and Ferguson has returned from injury in style. He was particularly impressive in the Champions League, and Australia would do well to play him in both games.The bowling does look a little thin, with Bollinger appearing to be the only real threat, but it has been shown over the years that the Australians combine well as a unit, and the bowlers, fielders and batsmen complement each other seamlessly.The weather forecast for the match is for isolated thunderstorms, and the groundsman at Vishakhapatnam has predicted a run-filled pitch. As long as the thunderstorms confine themselves to the field and not the clouds overhead, the fans who ensured that the venue was sold out within half an hour of tickets going on sale, should get a good show.Teams:India (From): Murali Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Ashish Nehra, Vinay Kumar, Ravindra Jadeja, Saurabh Tiwary, Munaf PatelAustralia (From): David Warner, Tim Paine(w), Michael Clarke(c), Cameron White, Michael Hussey, Callum Ferguson, James Hopes, Steven Smith, Clint McKay, Doug Bollinger, John Hastings, Nathan Hauritz, Shaun Marsh, Mitchell StarcLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
