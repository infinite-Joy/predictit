The ball skids on, through the massive bat-pad gate and through the keeper as well. The fielder from backward point gives chase and gets terribly unlucky flicking it back into his body and dragging the ball over the ropes

AFGHANISTAN:38.3 Cremer to Shahidi, out Lbw!! That's the eighth one down. Mere formality it has been for the last few overs with this pair sticking around aimlessly. But now Shahidi's stiff resistance has ended. Misread the length of this flighted ball. Played back when he should have been forward and gets caught on the crease. The ball skids on from off and hits him low on the pad while he was looking to work it through the on-side. Not quite sure that it would have gone on to hit off. Shahidi lbw b Cremer 31(67) [4s-2]Cremer to Shahidi, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!

AFGHANISTAN:31.4 Chibhabha to Shafiqullah, out Caught by Mutumbami!! Is there an edge there? The umpire certainly thinks there is. Looked to be the case given Mutumbami's appeal which was spontaneous. Length ball just outside off, Shafiqullah looks to push by thrusting his hands in front of the body.

AFGHANISTAN:31.1 Chibhabha to Sadiq, out Caught by Tendai Chisoro!! This is bizarre cricket. What kind of shot was he attempting? I, for one, can't discern.

AFGHANISTAN:29.5 Chibhabha to Shahidi, no run, too close to cut. Not short enough as well. And Shahidi is late on it too. Not much going for the shot and he misses

AFGHANISTAN:27.6 Chibhabha to Sadiq, no run, oooh, what was wrong with that appeal? Looked fairly close to me but for some reason, no one thought that way.

AFGHANISTAN:25.4 Chibhabha to Mohammad Shahzad, out Lbw!! Gone, and has the game too? Look at Zimbabwe's celebrations. This is the man they so desperately wanted to see the back of. And Chibhabha has done it. Back of a length delivery which skids on rapidly towards off, Shahzad didn't expect it to come so quickly as he tried to play across the line, hit him flush on the knee-roll of the back pad. That was plumb. Mohammad Shahzad lbw b Chibhabha 45(72) [4s-5]Chibhabha to Mohammad Shahzad, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!

AFGHANISTAN:18.5 Luke Jongwe to Mohammad Shahzad, 1 run, length ball outside off, Shahzad drops it in front of extra-cover and sets off. Shahidi responds early. What both batsmen didn't account for however, is the quickness with which extra-cover swooped forward, dived, gathered and under-armed the throw to effect a direct-hit - all in one motion. Shahidi's dive saved him despite the bat bouncing up for a bitExtra-cover has knocked off the stumps with a direct-hit and we go upstairs. Shahidi seems to be saved by his desperate dive.

AFGHANISTAN:0.6 Neville Madziva to Ali Zadran, out Caught by Mutumbami!! What a start for ZIM! Madziva has his man in the first over itself. Not the kind of start AFG would have hoped for.

Neville Madziva will open the attackWelcome back. The players are ready in the middle. Here we go...Still, it isn't the worst score given how this series has gone on. But just have a feeling that the pitch on offer today is much better. We'll have to wait and watch as to how Afghanistan go. If they are able to shed the baggage of their previous showing. Join us back in around half an hour.18:25 Local Time, 14:25 GMT, 19:55 IST: Afghanistan are huddled up on the outfield. Looks to be a motivational talk from the skipper. Should be a fairly satisfied unit after restricting the opposition to well under 250 - which seemed like a givenat one stage. If Zimbabwe are true to themselves, they must be very disappointed. Worked so hard to build a platform - especially the openers, both of whom registered fifties - and then tossed it away. Credit to the Afghani spinners for maintaining a tight hold right through those middle stages. Both, Hamza and Rashid impressed with their subtle variations in speed and length. And then, a flurry of wickets in the death meant that Zimbabwe could never realize their target.4
ZIMBABWE:49.1 Mirwais to Tendai Chisoro, out Bowled!! That's it. Takes only one ball to knock Chisoro over. On a length on leg, Chisoro slogs, misses, and the leg-stump is given a peck.

ZIMBABWE:48.4 Dawlat Zadran to Luke Jongwe, out Caught by Mirwais!! Slippery short of length delivery which hurried onto Jongwe.

ZIMBABWE:48.3 Dawlat Zadran to Neville Madziva, 1 run, slower short of length delivery just outside off, Madziva steers it in front of backward point and sets off. A direct-hit would have been interesting at the non-striker's end
ZIMBABWE:48.2 Dawlat Zadran to Neville Madziva, FOUR, oh my word. That's a sledge-hammer. He's steam-engined it over extra-cover. Pitched up outside off, Madziva slams it over extra-cover. Dropped just short of the ropes

ZIMBABWE:47.1 Rashid Khan to Neville Madziva, no run, well disguised googly turning back in prodigiously from a length wide of off, goes past Madziva's inside edge as he tried to defend. But what he did was get his front foot well across so the impact was outside the lineRashid Khan [9.0-0-38-3] is back into the attack
ZIMBABWE:46.6 Dawlat Zadran to Cremer, out Caught by Nabi!! Oh well taken. Had to really stretch every muscle there. And did a fine job of it, did Nabi. Full delivery just outside off, Cremer looks to loft it over mid-off, doesn't quite get hold of it. Still, seemed like he might just be successful. But Nabi had other ideas. Leapt exactly at the right moment, stressed every sinew of his body to stick both arms as high as possible. And cups it safely. Cremer c Nabi b Dawlat Zadran 11(10) [4s-1]Dawlat Zadran to Cremer, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

ZIMBABWE:45.3 Mirwais to Luke Jongwe, FOUR, woosh, he's timed the reverse sweep to perfection. Heck, he's nailed it. What makes it even more impressive was that he had to fetch it from leg-stump. Hits it over backward point and beats the dive of sweeper cover. Gosh, he didn't even bend his knees. So what do I call it? A reverse slog maybe
ZIMBABWE:45.2 Mirwais to Luke Jongwe, no run, length ball on off, jammed back to the bowler

ZIMBABWE:44.3 Dawlat Zadran to S Raza, out Bowled!! Zimbabwe are sliding in these final overs after doing all the hard work up front. Another one goes to a low percentage shot. Zadran is getting the ball to shape back in so it's better off to hit with the swing. But Raza decides to play a late-cut to a back of a length delivery. It swirls back in cramping him for room. Ends up chopping it on the pitch. Takes the off-bail after bouncing. S Raza b Dawlat Zadran 9(12) [4s-1]Dawlat Zadran to S Raza, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
ZIMBABWE:44.2 Dawlat Zadran to Luke Jongwe, 1 run, full and hooping back in on middle, Jongwe drags it down to long-on. The bat turned in his hands as he tried to hammer it straight down due to the movement

ZIMBABWE:43.6 Rashid Khan to Chigumbura, out Lbw!! This was coming. Khan had bowled a lovely over, so Chigumbura had to take that chance. Sits on his back knee aiming a booming sweep. But the length wasn't quite there. A tad too full to play the stroke. Sneaks under the bat and strikes him in front of middle and off. Not the toughest call for the umpire. Chigumbura lbw b Rashid Khan 13(13) [4s-2]Rashid Khan to Chigumbura, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
ZIMBABWE:43.5 Rashid Khan to Chigumbura, no run, nicely flighted leg-break on off, defended into the off-side

ZIMBABWE:42.6 Dawlat Zadran to Chigumbura, FOUR, rubbish delivery with fine leg up in the ring. Overcooked his yorker and ended up dishing the easiest of full tosses on the pads. Chigumbura flicks it past the diving fielder towards its only destination

Here we go...Teams:Afghanistan (Playing XI): Noor Ali Zadran, Mohammad Shahzad(w), Mohammad Nabi, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Asghar Stanikzai(c), Karim Sadiq, Shafiqullah Shafiq, Mirwais Ashraf, Dawlat Zadran, Amir Hamza, Rashid KhanZimbabwe (Playing XI): Peter Moor, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Elton Chigumbura(c), Sikandar Raza, Malcolm Waller, Luke Jongwe, Graeme Cremer, Neville Madziva, Tendai ChisoroZimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to batStanikzai: "Batting first or second does not matter. Yeah, just one change. Shamiullah Shenwari is not playing today. We have included Karim Sadiq."Chigumbura: "It is good to win the toss. It is a wicket to put runs on the board. We have been losing too many wickets upfront. We would like to assess the first 10 overs. It was good to see the character from our guys in the previous game. We hope we repeat that. No changes in the team."Pitch report: "It's a pitch which was used for the first two games. It is much harder, there are some cracks. But it is well rolled. Teams would prefer to have runs on the board," reckons Bazid Khan.All the three matches in the series have been low scoring ones. In the second ODI we did see both the teams crossing 250 but even that cannot be categorised as a high scoring match considering the scores we see in modern day ODIs. So what is going to be the order today? Are we going to see the batsmen running amok or once again it will be the bowlers who will rule the roost at Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium? We shall know in a while. Toss and team update follows, stay tuned...After ending 2015 on a high by finishing in the top 10 of the ICC ODI rankings, Afghanistan did not have a great start to 2016. A poor batting show saw them getting bundled out for 58 after their bowlers had restricted Zimbabwe to 175. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, remained afloat in the 5-match series after they had lost the previous two encounters. However, it will be interesting to see what strategies they have in their quiver to keep this series alive. Hello and a warm welcome to all of you to the 4th match of the series.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Peter Moor, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Elton Chigumbura(c), Sikandar Raza, Malcolm Waller, Luke Jongwe, Graeme Cremer, Neville Madziva, Tendai Chisoro, Craig Ervine, Wellington Masakadza, Tinashe Panyangara, Taurai MuzarabaniAfghanistan (From): Noor Ali Zadran, Mohammad Shahzad(w), Mohammad Nabi, Asghar Stanikzai(c), Hashmatullah Shahidi, Mirwais Ashraf, Samiullah Shenwari, Shafiqullah Shafiq, Rashid Khan, Dawlat Zadran, Amir Hamza, Yamin Ahmadzai, Gulbadin Naib, Karim Sadiq, Najibullah Zadran, Nawroz Mangal, Rahmat Shah, Rokhan Barakzai, Sayed Shirzad, Usman Ghani, Nawaz KhanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
