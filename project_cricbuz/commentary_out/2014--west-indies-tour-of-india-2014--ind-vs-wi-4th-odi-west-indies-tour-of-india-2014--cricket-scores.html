Can they swipe aside the off-field controversies and defy history tonight?Ramdin pats Kohli on the back in appreciation of his wonderful knock. MS Dhoni would be happy to see 330/6 on the board, especially after being asked to bat first. Though Rahane and Dhawan got off to a slow start, they went berserk all of a sudden and West Indies could never stem the run flow since then. Kohli batted at his usual No. 3 position today and he was simply outstanding. He shared a wonderful century partnership with Raina, before the latter threw it away after getting past fifty. Kohli though continued to bat aggressively and thrashed the West Indies bowlers to all corners. The fielding from the visitors was sloppy as well. In the end, India rode on Kohli's 20th ODI hundred to post a mammoth total. MS Dhoni mentioned about the dew factor at the toss. Has it taken effect already? Will it play a key role tonight? We'll find out in a while when West Indies come out to bat.4

Andre Russell is livid with the young kid. Captain Bravo points to the umpire and complains about it as well. Meanwhile, the umpires converge to discuss about it.

Taylor has a couple of slips to back him up.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Dwayne Smith, Darren Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Dwayne Bravo(c), Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder, Sulieman Benn, Jerome TaylorIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Akshar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Umesh YadavDhoni: "We wanted to bowl first as well. There will be plenty of dew. But, there will be plenty for the fast bowlers early on. We would like our batting to take extra responsibility than the bowlers. We have one change - Akshar Patel comes in for Amit Mishra."DJ Bravo: "We are going to bowl first. My team is standing behind me. We have had a tough time. We don't want the cricket to suffer. We are yet to come to an agreement (on the pay dispute). I must give credit to the boys for the fight. At the same time, we want to enjoy the game. Rampaul is out, Holder is in for the first time in this series."West Indies have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch report: "The pitch looks hard with a tinge of grass. If you look down closer, there are some cracks. But, these cracks won't open up regularly. Batting should not be a problem, bowling should not be a problem. We have an even contest. The locals tell that the dew factor may come into play later on" say Sunil Gavaskar and Michael HoldingA win for either side today will ensure that they don't lose the series. Greetings and welcome to the fourth ODI between India and West Indies with the picturesque Dharamsala providing the perfect setting.With a bouncy pitch in the offing will Ishant Sharma get a look in? Akshar Patel has also been added to the squad following his impressive returns in the World T20 League.With Simmons ruled out of the remainder of the series, the visitors will have to continue with a makeshift opening combination. The news is that West Indies are flying in Nikita Miller as a replacement for Simmons. For the hosts, Virat Kohli showed some semblance of form, scoring a fifty in Delhi, while Suresh Raina extended his purple patch. Shami has been India's go-to bowler at the death thanks to his fast yorkers and accuracy. Mishra also got encouraging turn, but there is plenty of room for improvement in the bowling department, as Dhoni has stressed time and again. The hunt for the third seamer is far from over.After Cyclone Hudhud forced the cancellation of the third ODI in Vizag, the action shifts to Dharamsala with the series locked at 1-1. If collapsing from 170/3 to 215 all-out was not enough, the standoff between the West Indies team and WIPA has escalated. DJ Bravo though will want his men to pull up their socks and produce a performance akin to the one in the opening ODI.PreviewBolstered by their dramatic come-from-behind win in the last game, India will look to keep the winning momentum going when they meet West Indies in the fourth cricket one-dayer here tomorrow on what is expected to be a pacy track.Pitch and conditions:The series is locked at 1-1 and the picturesque HPCA Stadium will provide the perfect setting as the two teams square off to seize the initiative before the final match of the series is played at Eden Gardens on October 20.The battle in the backdrop of the Dhauladar mountain range should be exciting, considering the fast and bouncy nature of the pitch. There is always a chance of rain in the hills. Therefore even a light spell of shower will further aid the pacemen besides making the conditions colder. The teams chose to stay put in Delhi post the match on Oct 11 and arrived at a much-higher altitude here only on the eve of the match.India:Squad: MS Dhoni (Captain and wk), Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Murali Vijay, Kuldeep Yadav, Akshar Patel.India's series-levelling victory at the Kotla was combination of West Indies' self destruction while cruising towards an easy win and also their inability to play on a track where there was some turn on offer. The spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Amit Mishra exploited the helpful conditions perfectly as West Indies lost eight wickets for 45 runs in their pursuit of a competitive total of 263. However, India might find it difficult for their spinners to extract same kind of help from the track here as they did from the pitch in Delhi. Facing a decent West Indies pace attack on a lively surface will be a test for the Indian batsmen. The home team had a tough time batting first here against England in January 2013, when it lost half its men for 79 runs before going on to lose the match.The best thing to come out of the Kotla game for India was Virat Kohli hitting some sort of form after a prolonged lean patch. A gritty 62 on a typically low and slow Kotla wicket must have done his confidence a world of good. It also proved that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's decision to drop Kohli down the batting order at four behind Ambati Rayudu worked and the skipper is expected to stick to the same sequence.Chief curator Sunil Chauhan has promised the wicket will assist the fast bowlers and that might make either captain consider a four-pronged pace attack. In that scenario, leggie Amit Mishra could make way for Ishant Sharma. With pitch offering some bounce and lateral movement, Ishant's hit-the-deck type of bowling might just be ideal for this kind of track. The World Cup not being far away and Ishant would like to throw his hat in the ring for being one of Dhoni's trusted lieutenant in the pace bowling department when the marquee event starts in February next year.While the Indian pacers haven't exactly set the stage on fire during the two ODIs, one man, who has surely impressed is Mohammed Shami. With eight wickets from two games, he is now the highest wicket-taker in the series and by far looked the best pacer on view during the death overs with his consistent deliveries in the blockhole.Though young left-arm spinner Akshar Patel has been included in the squad for the last two ODIs, he is unlikely to make it to the playing XI as two left-arm spinners would make the attack one-dimensional. It also seems rookie chinaman Kuldeep Yadav will have to wait longer for his international debut.West Indies:Squad: Dwayne Bravo (captain), Dwayne Smith, Darren Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin (wk), Andre Russell, Darren Sammy, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Jerome Taylor, Sulieman Benn, Jason Holder, Leon Johnson.It will be a challenge for the Indian bowlers to contain the in-form Dwayne Smith and Marlon Samuels, who have been the stand-out performers with the willow, for the visitors. While Samuels hit an unbeaten 126 in the first game at Kochi that the West Indies won convincingly, Smith was guilty of throwing his wicket away at the cusp of century (97) in the second game in the Capital. Overall, it will be interesting to see how the unpredictable visitors bat on a tricky surface.On the bowling front, West indies skipper Dwayne Bravo would surely expect his fast bowlers to come to the party. He has the option of bringing in speedster Kemar Roach to support Ravi Rampaul and Jerome Taylor while All-rounder Andre Russell will be expected to keep things tight in the middle overs.Match starts at 2.30 pm (IST).Teams:West Indies (From): Dwayne Smith, Darren Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Dwayne Bravo(c), Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Ravi Rampaul, Jerome Taylor, Sulieman Benn, Jason Holder, Leon Johnson, Kemar RoachIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(c/w), Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Murali Vijay, Kuldeep Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Akshar PatelLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
