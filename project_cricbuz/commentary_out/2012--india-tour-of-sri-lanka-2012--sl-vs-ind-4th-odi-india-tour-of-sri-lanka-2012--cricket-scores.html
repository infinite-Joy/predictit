Two slips in place.Teams:India (Playing XI): Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Manoj Tiwary, Irfan Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Zaheer Khan, Ashok DindaSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Pradeep, Lasith MalingaSo both Rohit and Manoj will play. Interesting, India have gone back to playing four bowlersDhoni: I think it will be tough for the fast bowlers because it is hot and humid. Death bowling has been an issue for the last few years. We have been strugging in the last ten overs, we have performed well in that area sometimes but we haven't been consistent. Manoj Tiwary comes in for Rahul Sharma.Mahela: We are going to bat first, we still feel like we need to get some runs up on the board as chasing without Kumar will be hard. We have been playing a lot of cricket but recently we have been playing well so we just need to focus on doing the right things. Even when you play so many games you are looking for those little challenges to push you through and every game provides those challenges. Thirimanne replaces Sangakkara.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batThe toss will be coming up soon. If Tiwary is benched today, he might as well just take the next flight homePitch report: The deck looks similar to the one that was used in the previous game, if anything it just looks a little drier. The wicket is pretty flat and there doesn't seem to be much in it for the bowlers. Win the toss and bat first says Arun Lal, no mention of the birds yet from him but we shall keep you updated on that front as well.Hello, and a warm welcome to the 4th ODI between Sri Lanka and India. The visitors have had a good run against the hosts in recent times and will look to wrap up the series today. On the other hand, the hosts would ideally love to take the series to a decider. Sri Lanka were delivered a cruel blow as Kumar Sangakkara was ruled out of the remainder of the series after suffering a fracture on his little finger. Will the hosts manage to put up a fight in the absence of their stellar batsman? Toss in 15 minutes..Preview by ShashreekFor a series that has been labelled as the most boring one in the season, the current scenario puts forth quite an irony. So far India and Sri Lanka have played each other thrice, each side has dominated the other on two occasions and India has managed to pip their opponents in the third encounter off the last over. At the moment, the series is precariously positioned with India leading 2-1 and a win from the hosts now could lay the way for an enthralling final. Try calling all of the above boring.All said and done Sri Lanka still need to win the 4th One Day International, not just for the sake of the interest levels of the series but also to keep themselves alive in it. India on the other hand have a marvelous chance of starting their season on a high, by sealing a win in the upcoming ODI. With one side desperate to pull things back and the other eager to wipe off past memories of a poor touring season, this game promises to deliver a lip-smacking tussle.Inside the dressing roomIndia: Despite the series scoreline being in their favour, India have looked slightly unpredictable as a unit. Fitness as always seems to be the 'Achilles heel' for the visitors. The injury to Pragyan Ojha isn't the only concern, Zaheer Khan's fitness levels on the field has been quite appalling. He has bowled some good spells with the ball, but if ever an artist wanted to paint a picture of a lazy fielder then Zaheer would make for the perfect subject.Batting is what India has thrived on for generations, but at times in this series the men with the willow haven't looked at their best. The second ODI was a perfect example of the rustiness in the batting department, however, the first and the third ODI showed just how talented this Indian line up can be with the bat in hand. Gautam Gambhir looks to be in top form and Virat Kohli too showed in the first game that he loves batting against the Lankans. Suresh Raina was the hero of the previous game, and on subcontinent wickets the left hander can be a real menace.The big question on everyone's mind is will Rohit Sharma get another chance, or perhaps does he deserve another chance. So far Rohit's team mates have backed him and he might just be given a longer leash, however, one has to feel for Manoj Tiwary who has spent most of his time with this Indian side warming the bench. Rohit has scored just five runs in the series so far and in a ideal situation, Tiwary should probably replace Rohit for the fourth ODI, however, selection in Indian cricket has always been anything but ideal.As far as the bowling is concerned, it has been a topsy turvey ride. With the new ball and in the middle overs, India has looked in control. The real problem has been with the death overs as none of the Indian bowlers seem to know what length to bowl in the last ten. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni did say that he had some reservations about the way his side has been bowling at the death and there is no doubt that Sri Lanka will be banking on that particular passage of play.Sri Lanka: Mahela Jayawardene's side has looked good in patches but have struggled to deliver the knockout punch. In the first ODI they looked far behind in class as compared to the Indians but were quick to dismiss that chain of thought in the following game. After losing the third match in the final over, Mahela and his men will be eyeing every opportunity to make amends.Sri Lanka are heavily dependent on their big three, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela and Kumar Sangakkara. Having said that, it is quite obvious then that the loss of Sangakkara is indeed a massive one and it could certainly affect the fate of this side in the series. The left hander has been the highest scorer in this series with a tally of 206 runs and finding an apt replacement will surely prove to be a herculean task for the hosts.Thissara Perera has been the go to man with the ball for the Lankans and has been their highest wicket taker with a tally of seven. The bowling line up does look like a steady one and has already shown in the second ODI that it can pose some serious threats at times. On these sort of pitches though, variation of pace acts as the real mode of deception and Angelo Mathews has proven to be a great exponent of the same until now. Lasith Malinga has been a bit of a let down, as the Indians have milked his bowling at a rate of 6.50 an over. All the more reason for the hosts to step up their level of batting.Weather: Scattered thunderstorms have been predicted with a 60 percent chance but a similar prediction turned out to be untrue in the previous game. So if history is an indication of things then we should have a good game of cricketFinal Word: Sri Lanka haven't been able to excel with the bat and should find it much harder to do so without the services of Sangakkara. If India can restrict the Lankans in the death overs then they should be able to complete a series victory.Teams: India (From): Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Virat Kohli, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashok Dinda, Gautam Gambhir, Zaheer Khan, Pragyan Ojha, Irfan Pathan, Virender Sehwag, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Rahul Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Manoj TiwarySri Lanka (From): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Chamara Kapugedera, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Upul Tharanga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Isuru Udana, Nuwan PradeepLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
