It is still raining and the entire square is covered. Play will not start on time but Russel Arnold thinks there is going to be a chase, he has tweeted, "Forecast ain't great but we should see a chase"The series is hanging in the balance. Can the English bowlers make up for the batting failure in overcast conditions? The pitch has been covered as it is drizzling but hopefully play will resume on time. Join us back for the run-chase in a short while.This was a below-par batting effort from the English batsmen on what was described as a good batting wicket by Cook himself. Both Bell and Cook enjoyed impressive starts but failed to kick on. The Sri Lankan spinners then blocked the hosts' escape routes in the middle overs. Buttler's outlandish dismissal has turned into a raging debate but one cannot take credit away from the Lankan bowlers. Over to the Sri Lankan batsmen now.4

Here we go...Brimingham experienced a downpour overnight but the conditions appear nice and sunny at the moment.Mathews: "I would have liked to bat first as well. The sun is out but I am not too concerned about chasing as well. It (The Senanayake issue) is not a big concern for us. Our Cricket Board will go through the processes. I am a little bit disappointed."Cook: "We are going to bat first. It looks a pretty good wicket, it won't change much. The new team is finding its feet, the beauty of today is a one off-game, a big game."Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Ashan Priyanjan, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha MendisEngland (Playing XI): Ian Bell, Alastair Cook(c), Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, James Anderson, Harry GurneyEngland have won the toss and have opted to batMoreover, the English coach, Peter Moores has dubbed this clash as a 'final'. Toss, teams and all the action to follow shortly.Meanwhile, Sachitra Senanayake has been pulled up for suspect action. However, Sena will be allowed to bowl until the result of the test procedure comes out.Hello, hello folks. The series is locked at 2-2 and the decider is almost upon is. Jos Butler cracked the fastest ton for England in the previous encounter but it was Lasith Malinga mastery, which prevailed at the end. Who will come up on top today? A series win will definitely boost the confidence, heading into the Tests.It's been a see-saw series so far with little to separate both teams. The ODI series has been hard fought with a few brilliant batting performances coupled with eye-catching bowling efforts. It's quite fitting that the series will be decided in the last game of the series.England:Chris Jordan has been the stand-out performer for England in the series but the others have made some useful contributions as well. Jordan, the revelation of the series has powered England with some noteworthy contributions. He is the highest-wicket taker in the series so far. Four of the top five wicket-takers in the series are from England. The group has been led well by the experienced James Anderson and Alastair Cook will want it to continue without change.Jos Buttler's record-breaking ton in the 4th ODI at Lord's has given the England batting-line up a dangerous look. Gary Ballance, Ian Bell and Ravi Bopara have been amongst the runs while the rest will have to step up in the important game. Cook himself will want to lead by example and set the tone in a crunch game.Sri Lanka:Sri Lanka have proved yet again that they are one of the best limited overs sides going around. Tillakaratne Dilshan has led the batting department with a couple of fifties. Sangakkara's sublime ton in the previous game also augurs well for Sri Lanka. However, they have come a cropper in testing conditions. Angelo Mathews, the skipper, has admitted that it was one of the biggest challenges for his team. It is imperative for the seniors to take responsibility in the final game.Lasith Malinga delivered at the crunch once again, Nuwan Kulasekara has been impressive with the new ball while Sachithra Senanayake has proved difficult to pick. Senanayake suffered a blow to his reputation after being reported for suspect action. The spinner, however, can continue to bowl in international games and he will need to concentrate on the game at hand.Sri Lanka also have the advantage of playing quite a few finals in recent times. That experience is bound to hold them in good stead in the decider.Quotes:We'll treat it like a final.
