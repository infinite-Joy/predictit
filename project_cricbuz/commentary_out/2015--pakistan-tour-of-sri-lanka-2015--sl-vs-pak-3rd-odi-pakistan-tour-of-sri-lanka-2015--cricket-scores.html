The match will restart in 4 minutes.Meanwhile, Mazher Arshad has tweeted this: The fight between two sections of the crowd created disturbance. It'll be wrong to think the crowd was anti-Pakistan. #SLvPak'Dean Jones has tweeted: "Massive problems outside the ground... Will advise when I know more. I cannot see us finishing the game sadly"Roshan Abeysinghe has tweeted: 'A few idiots and hooligans have dented the reputation of SL n SLC.'Not sure about the verdict of the game. We are waiting for the official confirmation regarding whether the match has already been awarded to Pakistan or will Sri Lanka bat out the remaining overs with empty stands.This is quite scary for the players. Stones being thrown at a visiting team, it's never good for the game. The security forces are marshalling the crowd. The riot police are currently busy escorting people out of the stands. We will have to wait for an official decision, while everything gets sorted in the stands. Looks like the ground is being evacutated. Meanwhile, both the umpires and the match referee are having a discussion. Apparently, there was some fighting amongst the crowd some 30-35 minutes before this incident as well. Some people were thrown out of the stadium. Thankfully, the teams are back in the safety of their dressing rooms.There's a delay in play as a Pakistani player was hit by a projectile near the rope. Match Referee Javagal Srinath is also out and supervising the proceedings. The Pakistani players have been brought in, while the security forces take control near the area. There are live visuals showing a full-fledged fight between the supporters. The Pakistani players are sitting in a circle for now. Even Dilshan looks surprised with what is happening.

Here we go then...Rizwan and Malik too played well towards the end and helped Pakistan post a mammoth total. Sri Lankan bowlers were not up to the mark and their fielding hasn't been impressive either. 300 has never been chased down at this ground, but can Sri Lanka do it today? Their batters will need another Kusal Perera-like innings at the start if they are to chase this big target. We will be back in a short while. Stay tuned for the Sri Lankan response....Pakistan got off to a bright start and ensured that they didn't lose any wickets in the first 15 overs. Both openers played with purpose and punished the loose balls from the Sri Lankan bowlers.

Sarfraz was the aggressive partner and he managed to score his runs at a quick click.4

It should do something with the new ball and hopefully, we will restrict them to a chaseable target, somewhere around 250-260. We are unchanged for this game. We can't fix our problems in a couple of days, but hopefully the guys will be up for the challenge today.'Ali: 'We are going to bat first. The wicket looks good. If we bat well, we should try and put on a good score as the pitch looks good. Imad Wasim comes in place of Babar Azam. We want to continue how we are playing.'Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batNot to forget, Pakistan's woes have increased ever since Mohammad Hafeez got banned for bowling. He's currently facing a one-year ban and can only play as a batsman. One can understand why Pakistan will miss him as a bowler, considering that he took 6 wickets in the first two ODIs. Pakistan were forced to bring in Imad Wasim to compensate for the loss of Hafeez, the bowler.The last ODI saw so many ups and downs. First, fifties from Ali, Malik and Rizwan helped Pakistan post 287 on the board. After Kusal Perera played a magnificent knock at the start of the innings, Sri Lanka lost a heap of wickets in the middle and were struggling at 196/6 at one stage. However, the lower-order, left by Dinesh Chandimal, kept their calm and Sri Lanka went on to win the game by 2 wickets.Hello and welcome to the third ODI between Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The series currently stands at 1-1 and the winner of the game today will definitely have a better chance of winning the series. Pakistan though have other agendas on their mind. They need to win the series to qualify for the Champions Trophy and if they lose the game today, they will have to win the next two, otherwise West Indies will qualify at their expense.Preview:A buoyant Sri Lanka head to the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo for the third ODI having levelled the series with a tense two-wicket win in Pallekele. In series that is tied 1-1, a victory in the third ODI puts significant pressure on the losing team, who then will have to win the two in two to clinch the series, something Pakistan desperately need to boost their chances of qualifying for the Champions Trophy. Pakistan are ranked No.9 in the ICC ODI rankings with only the top-eight teams eligible for participation in the multi-team team.Pakistan's woes have been compounded by the bowling ban imposed on Mohammad Hafeez. The 34-year all-rounder picked up six wickets in the first two ODIs and has been Azhar Ali's go-to man in the middle overs. Yasir Shah, after his Test series exploits, has had a quiet couple of games and will have to shoulder more responsibility in the absence of his spin partners. Pakistan allowed Sri Lanka to claw back into the Test series before eventually sealing the series win. A victory on Sunday will put them in pole position to clinch another.Date: July 19, 2015Venue: R. Premadasa Stadium, ColomboTime: 14:30 ISTWeather: Mostly Cloudy with a 57% chance of a thuderstorm around 5 PMTeam News:Sri LankaThe hosts have been well-served by Kusal Perera's belligerence at the top of the order but the middle-order's performance in the two games has been patchy. Thirimanne, Tharanga and Mathews are highly experienced and will need to step up and be counted. Dinesh Chandimal, though, has been consistent batting at No.6 and marshalled the lower-order well in Pallekele. Sachith Pathirana was expensive in his debut but added valuable runs low down the order and should keep his place in the eleven. The fielding, however, as Mathews bemoaned after the game has been 'terrible' and needs immediate addressal.Probable XI:Kusal Perera, Tilakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Upul Tharanga, Angelo Mathews (c), Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Thisara Perera, Milinda Siriwardana, Sachith Pathirana, Nuwan Pradeep, Lasith MalingaPakistanPakistan's bowlers did very well in Pallekele to pull things back after the Kusal blitz but how the unit will deal with the absence of Hafeez's suspension will determine how Pakistan shape up in Colombo on a track that has been tipped to assist strokeplay. The batting sports a fairly settled look to it with Mohammad Rizwan at No. 6 showing adequate potential in his quickfire half-century. The management could consider bringing in young Mukhtar Ahmed for a role in the top-order. The 22-year old impressed in the T20Is against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe and has been tipped for success in the 50-over format.Probable XI:Azhar Ali (c), Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Sarfraz Ahmed (wk), Anwar Ali, Yasir Shah, Rahat Ali, Mohammad IrfanStats and Trivia:- Kusal Perera's 17-ball fifty put him on second place in ODIs behind AB de Villiers' 16 ball effort and level with mentor Sanath Jayasuriya- Pakistan hold an 82-57 head to head advantage over Sri Lanka in ODIsQuotes:"We are on the right path. It's just that as I always say, we don't have Sangakkara and Mahela, that experience to deal with the pressure. But the boys are handling it pretty well"- Angelo Mathews on his team's ability to handle pressure in close games."The series is open and I am confident we will do well in the next game"- Azhar Ali put the loss in the second ODI as a one-off and was confident of a strong showing in ColomboTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Kusal Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal(k), Milinda Siriwardana, Sachith Pathirana, Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Pradeep, Ashan Priyanjan, Suranga Lakmal, Seekkuge Prasanna, Sachithra SenanayakePakistan (From): Azhar Ali(c), Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Sarfraz Ahmed(k), Anwar Ali, Yasir Shah, Rahat Ali, Mohammad Irfan, Mukhtar Ahmed, Ehsan Adil, Bilal Asif, Asad Shafiq, Imad WasimLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
