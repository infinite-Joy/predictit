SRI LANKA:5.2  Irfan Pathan to Dilshan, no run, slightly short outside off, Dilshan has a go at it and tries to cut but the ball goes under his bat. Perhaps he expects Irfan to be a little quicker

SRI LANKA:2.2  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, this time Zaheer bowls it outside off and Tharanga has no problems in letting it go through to the keeper. Zaheer needs to make the Sri Lankans play at every ball, they can afford to leave deliveries and take their time

INDIA:0.1  Zaheer to Tharanga, wide, starts with a wide down the leg side, Sri Lanka are away with an extraTharanga and Dilshan are at the crease. Tharanga is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackWe're back, just a short break.Thisara Perera was the star for Sri Lanka. At one point, his bowling figures read 3-3-0-3 (it should have been 3-3-0-4 had Mathews not dropped Dhoni on 0). He kept it simple and maintained a tight line and length and got his rewards. Angelo Mathews, Malinga and Herath supported him well in an extremely disciplined bowling performance. They were sloppy on the field to be honest, but India's batting was even more dismal. 139 should be an easy target, but it's not officially over yet. Stay tuned for the chase..A very poor batting display from India on a pitch that didn't have any demons. Sehwag, Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Raina, Dhoni and Irfan Pathan (that's almost the entire batting line up) succumbed to poor strokeplay and none bothered to try and hang around with Gambhir, who made a fighting half century. Ashwin was the second highest scorer with 21 runs before he was run out. 138 is all they managed - a below par total (needless to say).3
INDIA:33.3  Malinga to Gambhir, out Caught by Sangakkara!! What a catch! That sums up Sri Lanka's performance today - brilliant and sharp! Very full and wide outside off again, Gambhir looks to squeeze it out to third man, it goes off the face of the bat to the left of Sanga who dives and plucks it from the air. India all-out for 138. The scoreboard says it all. Gambhir c Sangakkara b Malinga 65(96) [4s-4] Malinga to Gambhir, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:33.2  Malinga to Gambhir, no run, very full and just outside off, Gambhir looks to jam it down to third man but fails to connect
INDIA:33.1  Malinga to Gambhir, 2 runs, risky! Gambhir steers this one to deep point and sets off for a couple, a poor throw from Mathews allows him to make it. Very weak throw that, should have done betterLasith Malinga [7.0-0-34-1] is back into the attackTrivia: Umesh Yadav has not been dismissed in an ODI. He is playing his 8th innings..The batting powerplay has been taken. Expect Gambhir to farm the strike now..
INDIA:32.6  Mathews to Umesh Yadav, leg byes, FOUR, some bonus runs for India. Mathews sprays it down the leg side and Umesh gets some pad on it, it goes wide of Sanga and into the fine leg fence
INDIA:32.5  Mathews to Umesh Yadav, no run, fuller length on the off, Umesh pushes it back to the bowler
INDIA:32.4  Mathews to Umesh Yadav, no run, good length and just outside off, Yadav goes for a shot and then leaves it at the endUmesh Yadav, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:32.3  Mathews to Ojha, out Caught by Sangakkara!! This time he edges it! Very similar to the previous delivery, only difference being the faint nick. Full and angled across again, Ojha pushes away from the body and edges it to Sanga. Sri Lanka are just a wicket away from finishing the innings. Ojha c Sangakkara b Mathews 5(18) Mathews to Ojha, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:32.2  Mathews to Ojha, no run, beaten. Fuller and closer to the off stump, Ojha pokes at it but misses

INDIA:31.3  Herath to Gambhir, 1 run, another single, comes to the pitch and drives it to long on
INDIA:31.2  Herath to Ojha, 1 run, easily done, leans and pushes it to point for a single, Ojha is looking quite comfortable out there

INDIA:23.6 Herath to Ashwin, out Ashwin Run Out!! 2 runs completed. Is anyone even surprised? Ashwin is run out again. And in a very familiar fashion. He cuts this one wide of short third man and runs hard to get 2, turns blindly and starts running the 3rd before realising that Gambhir was not interested. He then tried to turn around and dive in but it was too late. Gambhir was not interested in the third run from the start and Ashwin has only himself to blame. He looked good while he was there, but his running has undone him again. Ashwin run out (Udana/Sangakkara) 21(15) [4s-3] Herath to Ashwin, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Is Ashwin run out? Yes he is!

INDIA:19.5  Malinga to Irfan Pathan, out Caught by Thisara Perera!! Soft dismissal, but wait. Is it a no ball? The third umpire is checking, it looks close but should go the bowler's way I guess. A small part of his foot was behind the line before it slided, so Pathan stays out. Now to the description: Pathan looks to flick this one off his pads but gets a leading edge to mid off. Simple catch, can't keep Perera out of action today. India's all-rounder is gone and Sri Lanka are into the tail now.

INDIA:5.3  Thisara Perera to Virat Kohli, out Caught by Sangakkara!! What has happened there? A bit of drama but ultimately Kohli has to go. Perera bowls this one outside off and gets it to straighten, Kohli plays away from the body and looks to steer it to third man, there was a sound as the ball passed the bat and the appeal was spontaneous and loud. But the umpire took his own time, looked passive as Perera and co appealed vociferously and then suddenly raised his finger. It looked like he gave it out because of the pressure created by the appeal, but I guess the right decision has been made. Kohli is unhappy, he finally fails against Sri Lanka.

INDIA:3.6 Thisara Perera to Sehwag, out Caught&Bowled!! Superb catch! Perera is a wonderful fielder and he has plucked a beauty off his own bowling. Sehwag comes on the frontfoot and tries to slap it straight down the ground, but the bat turns in his hands and he ends up playing a bit uppishly. It seemed to be going away from Perera but he threw himself to his right and took it inches off the ground. That's the first strike, and a big one.

INDIA:2.1  Malinga to Gambhir, no run, good length and on the off, Gambhir comes on the frontfoot and defends itHere's @sanjaymanjrekar on twitter: 224, our audio technician counted 224 people currently watching the 2nd ODI between India & S.L at Hambantota
INDIA:1.6  Udana to Sehwag, FOUR, the over finally ends. Udana continues to bowl short and wide, Sehwag puts it away between point and cover this time. Just a backfoot punch but he timed it superbly, not the best of starts for Udana
INDIA:1.6  Udana to Sehwag, wide, change of angle, but he still can't stop bowling wides. Short, wide and outside off, Sehwag chases but can't get to itA deep square leg in place now as Udana goes round the wicket
INDIA:1.5  Udana to Sehwag, 2 runs, misfield. Poor stuff from Thirimanne. Sehwag flicks this one to mid wicket where Thirimanne lets it go through his legs. School boy stuff..
INDIA:1.5  Udana to Sehwag, wide, another wide. Full and wide outside off, Sehwag lets it go. This is a pretty long over..
INDIA:1.4  Udana to Sehwag, FOUR, no stopping it this time. Lesson number 1 for Udana in international cricket: don't bowl short and wide to Sehwag. He goes on the backfoot and cuts it over point, too easy
INDIA:1.3  Udana to Sehwag, no run, good stop by Dilshan. Sehwag plays his favourite cut shot towards point where Dilshan makes a diving stop to his left, a certain boundary saved
INDIA:1.2  Udana to Sehwag, no run, close to being called another wide, fuller and angled across, goes across the indicator line but the umpire gives him the benefit of doubt
INDIA:1.2  Udana to Sehwag, wide, and again! Udana is officially struggling early in his spell. Banged in short again but way too wide outside off
INDIA:1.2  Udana to Sehwag, wide, another wide. Is the breeze making it difficult for the bowlers? Short and way too wide outside off for Sehwag to play
INDIA:1.1  Udana to Gambhir, 1 run, back of a length and angled in, Gambhir works it to square leg
INDIA:1.1  Udana to Gambhir, wide, not the best of starts. Sprays it way outside off and starts with a wideIsuru Udana, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attackHere's Udana, on debut..
INDIA:0.6  Malinga to Sehwag, no run, stump to stump stuff, Sehwag comes on the frontfoot and defends it solidly
INDIA:0.5  Malinga to Sehwag, no run, full and down the leg side, Sehwag tucks it to mid wicket
INDIA:0.4  Malinga to Sehwag, no run, almost a mix up! Sehwag defends one awkwardly to point, Gambhir sets off for a run but Sehwag is not interested at all, Gambhir was more than half way down but had enough time to react
INDIA:0.3  Malinga to Gambhir, 1 run, good length and outside off, Gambhir guides it to third man for a single
INDIA:0.2  Malinga to Sehwag, 5 runs, Sehwag gets off the mark with 5! Sloppy from SL already. Sehwag gets an inside edge to the leg side and they go for a quick single, Chandimal runs in from mid wicket and fires a wild throw needlessly at the non striker's end, the fielder backing up had no chance
INDIA:0.1  Malinga to Gambhir, 1 run, he's away immediately, tucks one off his pads to fine leg, off the mark with a singleGambhir and Sehwag are at the crease. Gambhir is on strike. Malinga will open the attackWe're ready for the start. Play!In case you didn't know, here's Sehwag's explaining why India 'took' the batting powerplay early in the first ODI: "Actually, I asked Virat that whether he signalled for Powerplay but he said 'No.' He told me that he was pointing towards the dressing room to get his cap and the umpires thought that he has called for batting Powerplay. It was case of misunderstanding"Raina: When you bat number 5 or 6, it's difficult to score runs because you have to rotate the strike and attack at the same time. We (me and Dhoni) just concentrated on playing till the last ball and putting on a partnership. I was fully mentally prepared for this series, the break after the IPL helped. I learn a lot from Yuvraj and Dhoni, especially Dhoni. We complement each other when we bat together and I just look to learn from him. Now there are 2 new balls so we have to execute our plans, especially in the batting powerplay. We don't get too much time to play while batting at number 5 or 6, so we have to adapt quickly. Dhoni brings a lot of calm and he talks to me a lot while batting. He just tells me to be positive and look to play till the 50th over. We just look to play our natural games, it's easier when we have brilliant batsmen like Virat, Sehwag and Gambhir at the top. So myself and Dhoni have an important job lower down the order to finish the innings well.Not many people in the stadium once again. Sad to see two top ODI teams playing in front of empty stands, but it's not surprising I guess..Teams:India (Playing XI): Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Irfan Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Zaheer Khan, Umesh Yadav, Pragyan OjhaSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Rangana Herath, Isuru UdanaMahela: It's pretty unusual (the wind). We have to get used to it and adjust to the conditions. There is a bit more grass but it's dead grass so it shouldn't affect the pitch much. Good to have Udana in the side, he is a fighter and a young talent. Nuwan Pradeep is already here, the A team has just arrived so he'll join us in Colombo.Dhoni: It seems like the practice is working (about winning the toss). There is a bit more grass, so maybe there will be a bit more swing in the evening. If you bowl towards the pavilion end, the surface was drier so the spinners could exploit it more. The batsmen can score on both sides as the ball skids on and it travels. We bowled 15-16 wides in the last match, so we bowled 2 and a half overs extra. That had an effect on the over rate.India have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: The wicket is similar to the previous match. It is hard, dry and flat. There is a bit more grass on this pitch compared to what we saw in the first ODI. The conditions are good for batting despite the moisture on the track.Welcome to the coverage of the second ODI between India and Sri Lanka, once again from Hambantota. India won the first match rather comfortably, and will look to continue their momentum. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have been playing a lot of cricket in recent times and will look to keep up their energy levels against a fresh Indian side. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates..Preview by Nikhil NarainSri Lanka would look to square the series when they face India in the 2nd ODI at Hambantota tomorrow. Having lost the 1st ODI by 21 runs the home team would like to make amends and come back strongly at the Indians.Sri Lanka:They would be hoping that their premier fast bowler and star-attraction Lasith Malinga can make early in-roads into the powerful Indian top order. Malinga had a rare bad day during the 1st ODI when he conceded 83 runs off his 10 overs. He was hit around the park initially by Virender Sehwag and Virat Kohli and later by MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina towards the end of the Indian innings. Interestingly there were only 2 sixes hit in the Indian innings, one by each of these batsmen and both off Malinga, one of the most difficult bowlers in international cricket to clear the boundary off!There would be a forced change with Nuwan Kulasekara out of the series with a groin injury he sustained while attempting a diving catch of Sehwag in the first ODI. He has been replaced by Nuwan Pradeep who would be making his debut in ODIs having already represented Sri Lanka in 3 Tests.A good start by the openers would really help the Lankans. Upul Tharanga would have to rotate the strike more and occasionally take a few calculated risks to keep the run rate at par. He was a bit too cautious in the first ODI thus putting a lot of pressure on Sangakkara. The middle order would need to bat around Sangakkara whose century in the first ODI went in vain as the southpaw could never establish a real partnership with any one and had to preserve his wicket for a final assault at the end. By that time, the run rate required had soared up and the task become seemingly impossible.Captain Jayawardena would particularly be worried about Virat Kohli. He has 3 fifties and 3 centuries ( last 3 innings ) in his last 7 ODIs against the Lankans.They might want to experiment with the captain opening the innings, a position at which he has tasted success in the past, thus moving Tharanga down the order.The home team would also be looking to improve on their fielding and catches. Dilshan dropped a sitter of Sehwag in the first ODI, when the Indian opener was on a duck. He went on to score 96.India:No changes are expected in the Indian 11 though they might want to give the leggie, Rahul Sharma a chance at the expense of Pragyan Ojha who had an indifferent outing the other day at Hambantota. But that is highly doubtful with Sharma having tested positive for drugs at a rave party in Mumbai. They would be hoping for a better performance from their fast bowlers Zaheer Khan and Umesh Yadav who were hit for plenty in the first ODI.Irfan Pathan would like to continue the good work and also contribute with the bat.The selectors would be keeping a close eye on Rohit Sharma who failed to impress in the first ODI with Manoj Tiwary waiting in the wings.India should be wary of two players in the Sri Lankan lower order-Angelo Mathews and NLTC Perera. The latter played a 28 ball 44 cameo in the first match and has increasingly gained the reputation of a dangerous late-order batsman.It would also be interesting to see when India takes their batting power play in this match. They surprised the home team by opting for it in the 16th over in the first ODI with Kohli and Sehwag in full flow. Usually the bowling side takes the first power play within the first 20 overs and the batting side opt for theirs between the 33rd and the 38th over.Teams:India (From): Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Virat Kohli, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashok Dinda, Gautam Gambhir, Zaheer Khan, Pragyan Ojha, Irfan Pathan, Virender Sehwag, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Rahul Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Manoj TiwarySri Lanka (From): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Chamara Kapugedera, Lasith Malinga, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Sachithra Senanayake, Upul Tharanga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Isuru Udana, Nuwan PradeepLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
