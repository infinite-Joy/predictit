The hosts are already 2-0 up in the series and will be looking to put up another strong performance, and seal the series. Zimbabwe on the other hand, will be looking to improve their performance especially their batting, which has been poor in both the matches so far. Stay tuned for toss and team updates...Preview by Kaushik RangarajanBangladesh will look to wrap the series up when they take on Zimbabwe in the third One-Day International (ODI) of the 5-match series in Dhaka. The hosts haven't won a bilateral ODI series since they beat New Zealand at home same time last year. Zimbabwe, on the other hand will look to give a better account of themselves after a couple of indifferent performances that had captain Elton Chigumbura rue his side's inability to learn from mistakes.Bangladesh would be boosted by the form of fast-bowler Mashrafe Mortaza, who has, so far, taken five wickets in the two games. The fact that he thinks he is only at 80 percent of his level augurs well for the team. With Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal and Anamul Haque showing good touch with the bat, Bangladesh will have every reason to believe they can get the job done.Zimbabwe, on the other hand, did well to restrict Bangladesh to 251 in the second ODI but lost their way early in the chase. Solomon Mire showed that he is a useful middle-order batsman and could do with some assistance from the top-order. The good thing is that Zimbabwe realise that they now have a must-win game and that in itself may turn out to be the inspiration they so dearly seek.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Hamilton Masakadza, Sikandar Raza, Vusi Sibanda, Brendan Taylor, Solomon Mire, Regis Chakabva(w), Elton Chigumbura(c), Tinashe Panyangara, John Nyumbu, Tendai Chatara, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Natsai Mushangwe, Neville Madziva, Tawanda Mupariwa, Craig Ervine, Richmond Mutumbami, Malcolm Waller, Timycen Maruma, Peter Moor, Brian VitoriBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Mominul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Al-Amin Hossain, Jubair Hossain, Imrul KayesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
