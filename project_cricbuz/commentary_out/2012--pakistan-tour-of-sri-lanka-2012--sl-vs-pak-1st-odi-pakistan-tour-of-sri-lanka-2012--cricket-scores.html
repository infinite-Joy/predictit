SRI LANKA:12.4  Sami to Sangakkara, out Lbw!! First impression: was that going down the leg? A good delivery from Sami though - a pacy yorker that swings in, hits Sangakkara right on the boot in front of leg stump and the umpire raises his finger almost instantly. Sangakkara isn't impressed with the decision, he thinkg it would have missed leg, but it's a relief for Sami. Sangakkara's fight ends. Sangakkara lbw b Sami 9(31) [4s-1] Sami to Sangakkara, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!

Gul should have got 2 in 2..Upul Tharanga, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:8.4  Umar Gul to Chandimal, out Bowled!! Chandimal's struggle ends and Pakistan's pacers continue to impress.

Gul lands this on off and gets it to seam in, Mahela was caught on the crease and trapped in front of middle stump as he tried to block. Going down the leg side maybe? Doesn't matter, the skipper has to go. Mahela Jayawardene lbw b Umar Gul 3(20) Umar Gul to Mahela Jayawardene, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!

SRI LANKA:5.2  Tanvir to Mahela Jayawardene, no ball, Tanvir gets his reward! Or wait, are they checking for the no ball? Yes! It looks like a no ball. That's hard on Tanvir but he has only himself to blame. It was a superb delivery too - pitched on leg, nipped away, squared Mahela and took the edge to the keeper. He did everything right, except the fact that he overstepped..

Easy catch for Ajmal, it's humanly impossible to drop those. Hafeez will be relieved. Dilshan c Ajmal b Umar Gul 5(9) Umar Gul to Dilshan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:3.6  Tanvir to Mahela Jayawardene, no run, Mahela is tentative against Tanvir again, once again pokes his bat at the outside off zone and gets beaten

SRI LANKA:3.4  Tanvir to Mahela Jayawardene, no run, length ball on off, Mahela comes on the frontfoot and blocks
SRI LANKA:3.4  Tanvir to Mahela Jayawardene, wide, that's a very harsh call by the umpire. That was well within the wide indicator line but he has called it. Mahela backed away to make room and missed out on an expansive drive, Tanvir is understandably not impressed with the ball
SRI LANKA:3.3  Tanvir to Dilshan, 1 run, quick single, pats this softly to mid off region, calls early and gets it easily

SRI LANKA:2.2  Umar Gul to Dilshan, no run, back of a length around off, Dilshan pushes it to the off side
SRI LANKA:2.1  Umar Gul to Dilshan, no run, catch dropped by Hafeez. He made it look difficult but that should have been taken at this level.

Conditions look good but it rained in the last 2-3 days, the wicket was under cover. We aren't too sure about a par score, it would have been a difficult task had I won the toss.Mahela: It's a good wicket and runs on the board will be a crucial factor. We haven't played much ODI cricket here, but we think about 160 will be a good score. Herath is the only spinner in the side, we have 7 batsmen. Angelo Mathews makes a huge difference, it's good to see him fit.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batHello and welcome to the coverage of the ODI series between Sri Lanka and Pakistan. It's hard to judge the form of the teams - they shared honours in the two match T20 series and their recent ODI record has been mixed. Sri Lanka were terrific in the CB series in Australia, but horrible in the Asia Cup. Pakistan were exactly the opposite - they lost the ODI series to England but emerged champions in the Asia Cup. Who will get off to a winning start today? Stay tuned to find out..Preview by Siddharth PrabhakarA battle between Pakistan and Sri Lanka always has something in store for the connoisseurs of the game. Quality spin bowling, dogged yet classy strokeplay and tense, last ball finishes have come to become something of a regular whenever these two Asian countries meet in the shorter format of the games. The 2 match T20 series was no different with hosts Sri Lanka and Pakistan winning a game each. Both were low-scoring affairs and showcased evenly matched sides. Nothing different is expected when the two sides clash in the first of the 5 match ODI series which begins on June 7th in Pallekele.Sri LankaSince finishing as runners-up on the night of April 2nd 2011, Sri Lanka's form in ODI cricket has tapered off a bit. Other than the CB series in Australia, where they made the finals at the expense of India, their form in the ODIs against Pakistan in UAE and the Asia Cup has been really poor. The margin of defeat is also something that will play on their minds: 4-1 in UAE and defeats against all 3 teams in the Asia Cup. Much of this can be attributed to the constant change in captaincy as well as the squad over the last year. However, under Mahela Jayawardene, the team is progressing towards being a more settled outfit and the growth of captain-in-waiting Angelo Mathews is a sign of good things to come. Other youngsters like Dinesh Chandimal, Lahiru Thirimanne and off-spinner Sachitra Senanayake have excelled in the CB series and the selectors will be looking at them keenly. As far as the 2 T20s is concerned, except in-form allrounder Thissara Perera, no other player made a mark. The batsmen struggled against Pakistan's potent mix of spin and pace and were bowled out for a paltry 99 in the second game. Given the fact that experienced cricketing brains like Kumar Sangakkara and Jayawardene are in their midst, they will look to rectify the mistakes and come hard at Pakistan and hope to avenge the defeat in the ODIs in UAEPakistanCurrently, in international cricket, if there is one team which is THE team to beat, it is Pakistan. Over the past year or so, starting from the World Cup, they have shown that they can be invincible. Probably the only ODI side which has an impressive mix of pacers like Umar Gul, Aizaz Cheema and spinners like Shahid Afridi and Saeed Ajmal, their Achilles heel is the brittle middle order. They are heavily dependent on the 'Professor' Mohammad Hafeez and Younis Khan to give them a solid start. Youngsters like Ahmad Shehzad, Asad Shafiq and Umar Akmal have shown that Pakistan's future has potential, but their consistency leaves much to be desired. In the first T20 against Sri Lanka, the side was bowled out for a paltry 95. Shoaib Malik, who has been the biggest investment of the Pakistani selectors, hasn't delivered and more often than not, too much is left for the redoubtable Shahid Afridi to do. They were handed out a solid thrashing by the England in UAE, where they lost 4-0, but as has been the case with the 92 World Cup Champions, they bounced back in time to clinch the Asia Cup. This is coach Dav Whatmore's first assignment and it will be interesting to see what tricks he employs against a country whom he helped win the 96 World Cup.
