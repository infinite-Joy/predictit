Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.Chris Gayle, who sat out in the last T20, will also be back in the side. However, Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard, who were overlooked for the World Cup squad, are not part of the ODI series squad as well. The West Indies will be led by a new captain in Jason Holder.South Africa managed to win the last T20I, but Chris Gayle's sheer dominance during the first two games showed us that the Proteas are not invincible. The hosts will definitely be boosted by the return of their star players. AB de Villiers, Dale Steyn, Hashim Amla, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander were all absent during the T20Is, but will play the ODI series. JP Duminy, who has recovered from his knee injury and participated in the last T20I, is all set to feature in the ODIs too.After a 2-0 drubbing in the Test series, West Indies came back strongly to lift the T20I series 2-1. Their charge was led by their opening batsman Chris Gayle, who was belligerent with the bat. He played the first two T20Is and registered scores of 77 and 90, thrashing the Proteas bowlers to all parts of the park.Preview:South Africa and West Indies square up in five one-day internationals, starting at Kingsmead on Friday, in their final round of competitive matches before the World Cup starts in Australia and New Zealand next month. South Africa will be fielding their World Cup squad, with the exception of injured wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, who has been replaced for the series by veteran Morne van Wyk.West Indies announced their one-day squad for South Africa late last year and the World Cup squad, announced last week, has three changes. Darren Bravo, Sunil Narine and Kemar Roach will be playing in the World Cup but are not in South Africa. Three players named for the South African series, Carlos Brathwaite, Narsingh Deonarine and Leon Johnson, will not be going to the World Cup.AB de Villiers had a rocky start as South African one-day captain after being appointed in 2011 but the side showed major improvement last year, briefly rising to top place in the International Cricket Council rankings before suffering a 4-1 defeat in a series in Australia late last year. Missing from the Australian series was JP Duminy, a reliable batsman and off-spin bowler, and South Africa's lack of a quality all-rounder was exposed, with their lower order batsmen struggling to maintain an acceptable scoring rate in the closing overs. Duminy made his return to action after a knee injury in the final Twenty20 international against the West Indies on Wednesday and will give the side a better balance.Outclassed in the Test series, West Indies dominated the first two Twenty20 internationals before losing the third with a weakened team. They are likely to be competitive against South Africa, although the hosts will start favourites with star players De Villiers, Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel back in action after missing the Twenty20 games.Like South Africa, the West Indies selected a different captain for each format on the tour. All-rounder Jason Holder will lead the one-day side and will also be in charge for the World Cup.Teams:West Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Lendl Simmons, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Narsingh Deonarine, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Sulieman Benn, Leon Johnson, Sheldon Cottrell, Jonathan Carter, Carlos BrathwaiteSouth Africa (From): Morne van Wyk(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Phangiso, Kyle Abbott, Farhaan BehardienLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
