We will get to know in the next 100 overs.Pitch Report: The pitch looks a bit darker today, there might be some moisture underneath the surface. Batting will not be easy though, teams winning the toss might well look to bowl first.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Dwayne Smith, Kieran Powell, Kirk Edwards, Darren Bravo, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo(c), Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Nikita MillerEngland (Playing XI): Michael Lumb, Moeen Ali, Luke Wright, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad(c), James Tredwell, Stephen ParryEngland have won the toss and have opted to fieldHello and welcome to the second ODI at Antigua. On a slow and low wicket, West Indian bowlers and batsmen came to the party to take a 1-0 lead in the 3-match series. The batting was set-up by Simmons, Dwayne Bravo and Sammy as they posted a competitive total on the board. Then their slow bowlers did the job to restrict England who at one stage were well on course to victory. The visitors have a depleted side as Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan are out injured. Michael Lumb stepped up and scored a hundred on ODI debut but once he got out it all went downhill. Will there be any changes for both the sides? Toss and teams coming up.... PreviewEngland's poor run outside home continued, when they wasted a good start by two debutants to go down to the West Indies by 15 runs in the first of three ODIs in Antigua on Friday.Michael Lumb's debut hundred went in vain as an England line-up, without the assurance of Alastair Cook, Eoin Morgan and the sacked Kevin Pietersen, wilted under pressure and let the hosts run away with the game. There is not much experience in the England middle-order and it is therefore important for Lumb to bat like a seasoned pro, despite just one ODI and 20 T20 internationals under his belt.Lumb has been active in the English domestic scene for the last 14 years, and he will be an important asset for stand-in captain Stuart Broad, as will be the likes of Ravi Bopara, Jos Butler and Joe Root. Morgan, after missing the first game, appears to be unlikely to for the second game on Sunday as well, as England may not want to risk him ahead of the World T20.The bowling, again will have to revolve around the captain and he would expect the likes of Tim Bresnan and Chris Jordan to chip in with valuable spells.West Indies on the other hand, were boosted by skipper Dwayne Bravo and former skipper Darren Sammy, whose brutal hitting, coupled with Lendl Simmons' composed innings, helped the hosts to a sizeable score, even in the absence of the explosive Chris Gayle at the top.England are coming off a horror summer in Australia and they would not want to go down in another series, despite the lack of experience. Jason Holder, Ravi Rampaul, Dwayne Bravo and Sunil Narne make a formidable bowling unit but it will be important for England to hold their own and follow the examples of Lumb and Ali, who did not score a century but still contributed with a solid 59-ball 44.Stats- 1998: The last time West Indies won a bilateral ODI series against England at home. England have won an ODI series in West Indies only once, which happened in 2009 when they defeated them 3-2.- 136: The number of runs Darren Bravo requires to reach the mark of 2000 in ODI cricket. In case he gets the required number of runs in this match, Bravo will become the 18th West Indian and the 9th fastest West Indian player with 2000 or more runs.QuotesWe have lost the first game but we did a few things well. I am delighted for Lumb. It was the last 10 overs with the ball that hurt us. We will have to learn quickly - Stuart Broad, England captainI told the boys that we were going to win it. Our best bowler, Rampaul finished it off. We will have a lot to improve though - Dwayne Bravo, West Indies captainTeams:West Indies (From): Dwayne Smith, Kieran Powell, Kirk Edwards, Darren Bravo, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo(c), Darren Sammy, Denesh Ramdin(w), Jason Holder, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Miguel Cummins, Nikita Miller, Marlon SamuelsEngland (From): Michael Lumb, Moeen Ali, Luke Wright, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad(c), James Tredwell, Jade Dernbach, Alex Hales, Eoin Morgan, Harry Gurney, Stephen ParryLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
