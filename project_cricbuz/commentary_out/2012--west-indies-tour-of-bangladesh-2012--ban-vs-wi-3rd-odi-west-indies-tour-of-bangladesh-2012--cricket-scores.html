They are capable of coming back, but we are confident about our abilities. Abul misses out due to injury and Rubel comes in.'Sammy:  'We will bowl. Looks like there is a bit of moisture on the surface. We are confident about our abilities. We need to back our ability and excecute our plans.'Pitch Report: Similar sort of surface at Dhaka. It is very dry and should support the spinners as the match progresses.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Kieran Powell, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Smith, Kieron Pollard, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Veerasammy Permaul, Sunil Narine, Ravi RampaulBangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Naeem Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Sohag Gazi, Abdur Razzak, Rubel HossainLet me begin with some sad news. With Bangladesh leading 2-0, there was apparently a heavy rush for tickets. Disgruntled crowd resorted to violence which left the National Cricket Academy as well the BCB offices badly damaged.West Indies have won the toss and elected to fieldHello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the 3rd ODI between Bangladesh and West Indies. The hosts last won a ODI series at home against New Zealand in 2010. A win today will create history for the hosts, they will leapfrog West Indies into the 7th position in the ICC One Day rankings. The visitors have been pretty poor in the first two matches and will hope for a much better show today.Preview by Shashreek RoyWest Indies have been given a rather rude shock after their successful Test exploits. While the visitors managed to battle through Bangladesh's spin attack in the five day format, they have crumbled against it in the ODIs. West Indies' weakness against spin has been exposed and with it Bangladesh has managed to reveal the visitors' inability to adapt and switch from their usual style of play, which has been all out attack. 'Attack is sometimes the best form of defence' is a phrase often used and a practice that might work against spin. Then again, the phrase comes with the word sometimes and not with always, displaying anything but a sense of guarantee. West Indies have perhaps overlooked the word sometimes and have shown a one dimensional approach by trying to attack throughout the innings. That method has left them looking amateurish and more importantly has placed them at the brink of a series defeat. West Indies now need to look at the way their opponents have patiently built partnerships and adopt a similar approach if they are to stage a comeback in this series. Team News West Indies: The visitors have shed the favourties tag in the span of just two matches and are staring at a series defeat. A lot of it has to do with the side's inability to build stable partnerships. In fact, the highest partnership for West Indies this series has been just 57 runs and it has come for the 9th wicket, between Sunil Narine and Ravi Rampaul. Just the fact that the highest partnership has been scored by the men at number 8 and 9 shows how poor West Indies has been in the batting department. Apart from Darren Bravo, every batsman in Darren Sammy's side has an average below 30 and worse still, Narine's 36 is the highest score by any batsman in the side. Those batting figures do not make for good reading and to add to West Indies' woes, the bowling hasn't been at its penetrative best. Narine, who has been a force to reckon with on pitches that offer some turn, has managed to pick up just one wicket over the two matches and hence has an appalling average of 87. Sammy too hasn't been able to lead from the front whether it be with the bat or the ball. The skipper has taken just one wicket and has scored just 22 runs in the two games played so far. Ravi Rampaul was the standout bowler in the 2nd ODI after he took a five wicket haul and the West Indies will have their hopes pinned on him. It might be a good idea though, to throw in another spinner into the playing XI. Perhaps the visitors could include Veerasammy Permaul, seeing the success of the opposition's left arm orthodox. Bangladesh: The hosts have displayed a perfect combination of patience and resolve. Bangladesh have batted and bowled with a clear plan and purpose and that has yielded success. What Bangladesh have done well is that they have built big partnerships, in fact the highest one was a mammoth 174 between Anamul Haque and Mushfiqur Rahim for the 3rd wicket. As opposed to the West Indies, Bangladesh have five men who are averaging 30 and above and that always is an indicator that the side is batting well. Bangladesh's real strength has been the ability of their spinners to pick up wickets. Sohag Gazi troubled the visitors in the Test series and he has continued to be a nuisance for them in the ODIs. Gazi has managed to pick up 7 wickets at an average of just 7.14 and an economy rate of 2.94. Abdur Razzak too has been prolific with 6 wickets at an average of 9.66 and an economy rate of 3.86. With the way these two have been bowling, Bangladesh can go in to the 3rd ODI feeling extremely confident of a positive result. Final Word: If the West Indies fail to show patience in the third ODI, then their side could well and truly lose the match and the series as their opponents have been nothing short of brilliant.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Naeem Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Sohag Gazi, Abul Hasan, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Jahurul Islam, Shafiul IslamWest Indies (From): Lendl Simmons, Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Smith, Kieron Pollard, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Veerasammy Permaul, Kieran Powell, Kemar Roach, Jason HolderLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
