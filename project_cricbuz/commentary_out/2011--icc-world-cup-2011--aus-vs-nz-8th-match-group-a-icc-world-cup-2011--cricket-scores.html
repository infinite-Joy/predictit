AUSTRALIA:4.4  Southee to Watson, 2 runs, Haddin was gone if that throw from Franklin had hit direct, he was not expecting the throw at his end as he rushed back for the 2nd, he was inches short, but the throw missed anyway, sharp 2nd attempted too
AUSTRALIA:4.3  Southee to Haddin, 1 run, that's what coaches tell you to do after you hit a boundary, turn the strike over and settle down at the non-striker's end and that's what Haddin does, tapping it wide of mid wicket
AUSTRALIA:4.2  Southee to Haddin, FOUR!!, Terrific shot! Short and wide, too much room and a player of Haddin's calibre won't miss out, reached out and thrashed it wide of all the men who are packed in close on the off side, the pressure is back on the bowler

AUSTRALIA:2.4  Southee to Haddin, no run, one ball defence, the next attack seems to be Haddin's plan, this time he does not get the timing or the sweet spot on the bat to find the gap as he did the last ball of Southee's 1st over, mistimes the intended inside out cover drive to mid off
AUSTRALIA:2.3  Southee to Haddin, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, Haddin is a compact player of the backfoot defence and he unfurls that stroke to show off his defensive capabilities
AUSTRALIA:2.2  Southee to Haddin, FOUR!!, and Haddin is not going to hang back waiting for things to happen, instead he is going to make things happen, heaved wide of backward square leg, a thickish inner half of the bat, but the outfield has quickened up and that will be an easy boundary

AUSTRALIA:0.3  Southee to Haddin, wide, poor ball that, Southee is striving for pace, drifts one down leg
AUSTRALIA:0.2  Southee to Watson, 1 run, the key to it was waiting for the ball to come on, Watto opened the face of the bat late running it down to third man, he gets off the mark
AUSTRALIA:0.1  Southee to Watson, no run, Watson presses forward to drive but ends up mistiming it back down the wicket
NEW ZEALAND:0.1  Southee to Watson, wide, Southee starts with a one banged in short, the ball goes down the leg, wide signalled by the umpireWatson and Haddin are at the crease. Watson is on strike. Southee will open the attackThis should be an easy chase or will it? The Kiwis need early wickets, which might sound cliched, but that holds true if they are to have any chance of winning this game. Remember Australia are all set to extend their unbeaten streak in WC games to 31 if they win today. Can anyone stop them at least in this tournament? The answer to that awaits us. The Aussie openers walk out.Johnson: I'm enjoying my time here so far, all bowlers did their job pretty well. A good score to chase it down quickly, we got our confidence going after the Zimbabwe game and hopefully our batters can go out and get it without any hassles. There is something for the bowlers, the wicket is pretty good in general for ODIs.NZ top and middle order were guilty of playing too many rash shots as NZ failed to cash in on good batting conditions. Brendon McCullum started the slide with a wild slash but it was the middle order collapse that saw NZ slump from 66/2 to 73/6 that hurt the Kiwi cause. Franklin, Styris and Taylor gifted their wickets with some horror strokes. The late order did retrieve the situation with some sensible stroke-play. Nathan McCullum is one of the most improved lower order batsmen around and he led the resistance with his 3rd ODI fifty, and his 1st in WC cricket. Daniel Vettori continued to thrive under pressure as he scored a useful 44. Mitchell Johnson and Shaun Tait were the wreckers in chief for Australia who will feel that they have got the match firmly in their grasp. Do join us in a short while for the Aussie chase.4
NEW ZEALAND:45.1  Johnson to Southee, out Caught by Ponting at mid off!! Vettori might have not reached the dressing room yet, and Southee decides to follow him, skies a fuller delivery straight up in the air, the ball was swirling in the air a little bit, at least that's what we could make out from the expression on Ponting's face who judged it quite well at mid off, kept his eyes underneath the ball, and took it the Aussie style.

NEW ZEALAND:13.5  Johnson to Franklin, out Caught by Haddin!! This is shambolic stuff from the Kiwis. A rank bad shot from Franklin to get out and Johnson is chuffed to bits. The Aussies are all over their neighbours like a rash. A full and very wide delivery outside off, Franklin wanted to play that extravagant cover drive, he would have been better advised to leave that alone, but such is the temptation to get off the mark that Franklin could not resist.

NEW ZEALAND:13.2  Johnson to Ryder, out Caught by Haddin!! Poor foot-work from Ryder and he has played like that all day, but this time he won't survive. He has trusted his instincts so far and his eye, went after a good length delivery outside off, pushed at that ball with no feet, Johnson rolled his fingers on that and cut it, the ball did nothing off the pitch, just a bad shot from Ryder and another Kiwi falls just when he was looking good for a big score. Ryder c Haddin b Johnson 25(31) [4s-6] Johnson to Ryder, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
NEW ZEALAND:13.1  Johnson to Ryder, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, Ryder drives it off the backfoot to cover, played from the creaseIt is time for Drinks as well.

And it is a good time to hand over the comm duties to Pradeep who will let you know whether they do so.
NEW ZEALAND:12.6  Watson to Taylor, leg byes, FOUR!!, poor bowling from Watson this, slides one down leg, all Taylor had to do was to get some pad on that or bat and he got the pad, beating Haddin to his left and racing away to the fine leg, fence

NEW ZEALAND:11.4  Johnson to Ryder, no run, fullish and speared in towards the toes, Ryder eases it to mid on
NEW ZEALAND:11.3  Johnson to Ryder, FOUR!!, Another one of those patented Ryder short arm jabs, he just lifts his one leg up in the air and then pulls it with immense power to backward square leg, same area and same result, Gordon Greenidge would have been proud of that, though he is right handed and Ryder is a leftie
NEW ZEALAND:11.2  Johnson to Ryder, FOUR!!, he had played a fine pull shot the previous over, that was in front of square, this one is behind square, short arm pulled, with one leg up in the air, almost West Indian like from Ryder, Johnson isn't happy with himself, it was down the leg side and Ryder executed it to perfection
NEW ZEALAND:11.1  Johnson to Ryder, no run, terrific fielding from Pup, moved swiftly to his left at cover and stopped a free flowing drive from Ryder
NEW ZEALAND:10.6  Watson to Taylor, no run, MAIDEN OVER!! from Watson, again kept a tad low, similar to the one that got Guptill out, but Taylor was well forward and kept it out

NEW ZEALAND:9.1  Johnson to Ryder, FOUR!!, there is a short cover and a short mid wicket in place, but that does not matter for Ryder who takes on the short delivery and rolls his wrists on it and pulls it in front of square, a desperate dive to his right from deep square leg, and he could not save it too
NEW ZEALAND:8.6  Watson to Taylor, no run, good probing wicket taking over from Watson comes to an end as Taylor pushes one back with the full faceRoss Taylor, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:8.5  Watson to Guptill, out Bowled!! Lack of foot-work does Guptill in this time. As Athers said on air, he should have been well forward, instead hung back and the ball kept very low, took the bottom edge as he looked to defend and cannoned into the off stump, Watson has been the man who can strike very important blows with the ball for Aus and once again he has removed a key batsman. Though Guptill would feel unlucky about the low bounce, if this keeps happening then that should encourage his side as the game goes on. Guptill b Watson 10(25) [4s-2] Watson to Guptill, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
NEW ZEALAND:8.4  Watson to Guptill, no run, Guptill went after the full ball outside off and threw his bat at that, missed and the ball went on the bounce to Haddin
NEW ZEALAND:8.3  Watson to Guptill, no run, good length delivery outside off, slower too, left alone

NEW ZEALAND:8.1  Watson to Guptill, no run, little bit of shape and almost shaved the off stump, Guptill played down the wrong line and got slightly inside the line as the ball swung back in, close to the outside edge tooShane Watson, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
NEW ZEALAND:7.6  Johnson to Ryder, no run, sliding down the leg side and catches Ryder's pads, Ryder would feel that he has missed out there
NEW ZEALAND:7.5  Johnson to Ryder, no run, leading edge, but rolled back to Johnson as Ryder closed the face on that too early
NEW ZEALAND:7.4  Johnson to Ryder, FOUR!!, Johnson can do that, short and wide delivery outside off, Ryder carved that with immense power, wide of the off side field, hit with a lot of bat speed and it raced away, first runs that Johnson has conceded today
NEW ZEALAND:7.3  Johnson to Ryder, no run, Ryder was winding up for the big hit, then as it hurried onto him he defended back to the bowler, 9 dots in a row from Johnson

NEW ZEALAND:7.1  Johnson to Ryder, no run, full ball on off stump, Ryder stays back and steers it with an open face to backward point
NEW ZEALAND:6.6  Lee to Guptill, FOUR!!, Sehwagesque, well played too, short and wide outside off, Guptill arched his back, stayed beside the line and helped it on it's way, just used Lee's pace and guided it up and over the slips, one bounce over the ropes, second time in two overs that Lee has conceded a boundary off the last ball of the over
NEW ZEALAND:6.5  Lee to Guptill, 2 runs, Oh! I too have missed out on the fact that Guptill has got off the mark only off his 19th ball, I thought that he had scored some runs, anyway, a nice looking cover drive, which slows down to the heavy outfield, a couple of runs
NEW ZEALAND:6.4  Lee to Guptill, no run, good length delivery on off stump, Guptill gets right behind the line to defend
NEW ZEALAND:6.3  Lee to Ryder, leg byes, 1 run, thuds into Ryder's thigh guard, as the ball bounces towards his pads, they steal a leg-bye

NEW ZEALAND:6.1  Lee to Ryder, no run, back of a length delivery and angled across, on a good pace too, Ryder is just staying back and trying to play without much foot-work, beaten on the backfoot driveRavi Shastri on air: This is the mother and father of all World Cups.
NEW ZEALAND:5.6  Johnson to Guptill, no run, Johnson starts with a MAIDEN OVER!! as Guptill blocks again from the crease

NEW ZEALAND:4.6  Lee to Ryder, FOUR!!, finally gets one away and spoils the maiden over for Lee, short and wide outside off, lashed out past cover, square cut away into the ground and dribbled away to sweeper cover, Ryder is away, Lee knew straightaway that he had bowled a poor delivery and grimaced in pain as he saw the ball go to the fence
NEW ZEALAND:4.5  Lee to Ryder, no run, a nervous poke as Ravi Shastri would say, fullish delivery outside off, Ryder went for the cover drive, did not move his front-foot across and was stuck on the crease as the ball beat him, Haddin collected it low and well
NEW ZEALAND:4.4  Lee to Ryder, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, Ryder defends it backward point from the crease
NEW ZEALAND:4.3  Lee to Ryder, no run, Lee aborted the appeal mid way, it was sliding down the leg side as it struck Ryder on the pad, Ryder looks very nervous and is not moving his feet much early on, he is a big player as far as his side are concerned and he needs to play a big one
NEW ZEALAND:4.2  Lee to Ryder, no run, short ball and flies past the left shoulder of Ryder who ducks, Haddin just about manages to save it, with an outstretched right glove, signalled one for the over
NEW ZEALAND:4.1  Lee to Ryder, no run, angled across Ryder, on a good length outside off, Ryder shoulders arms

NEW ZEALAND:3.4  Tait to Brendon McCullum, out Caught by Krejza at third man!! Over-aggression costs Brendon McCullum, he got too greedy and paid the price. He had already scored enough for this over, still went after a full and wide delivery outside off, the thick outside edge went and landed straight in third man's lap. They went upstairs to check for the no-ball and Tait was fine. Brendon McCullum bangs his bat into the ground in disappointment as he walks off. A big wicket that for Aus. Brendon McCullum c Krejza b Tait 16(12) [4s-3]ver Tait to Brendon McCullum, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Brendon McCullum has been caught at third man, but they are checking for a front-foot no-ball. Looks to be fine as far as the replays show and he is walking off.

NEW ZEALAND:3.1  Tait to Brendon McCullum, FOUR!!, that was expected, hurled in short outside off, Brendon McCullum was creating his own room, moved to leg and then reached out to upper cut it square of the wicket, a couple of bounces and into the ropes, got it off the toe end of the bat, good use of the free hit
NEW ZEALAND:3.1  Tait to Brendon McCullum, wide, the free hit stays as Tait delivers a bouncer which is well above the head of Brendon McCullum
NEW ZEALAND:3.1  Tait to Brendon McCullum, no ball, Tait has overstepped, if not for the no-ball, it would have been a wide for it was well outside off, Brendon McCullum threw everything at it and could not connect, a free hit coming up, Punter comes up to Brendon McCullum and has a word with Tait

NEW ZEALAND:2.5  Lee to Guptill, no run, solidly defended off the front-foot towards cover
NEW ZEALAND:2.4  Lee to Guptill, no run, Guptill is a tall man and he was surprised by that nasty rip corker of a bouncer, that reared up on him and hit on the glove as he arched back, for a moment it looked like that it might pop up to the men on the off side, but Guptill softened the blow, Lee has a word with Guptill too, he does not mind a verbal, does Lee
NEW ZEALAND:2.3  Lee to Brendon McCullum, 1 run, Brendon McCullum will be looking to take the sharp singles too, tapped in front of short cover, and off he goes

NEW ZEALAND:1.5  Tait to Guptill, no run, back of a length and into the ribs, Guptill defends it to square leg
NEW ZEALAND:1.4  Tait to Brendon McCullum, 3 runs, a rare sight to see - Ponting misfielding, the attempted yorker goes wrong, a low full toss is driven to the right of the Aussie skipper and he gingerly dives, but can't stop it, the slow outfield keeps it to 3
NEW ZEALAND:1.3  Tait to Brendon McCullum, FOUR!!, Super shot that, a Brendon McCullum special, short and wide outside off, rising too, Brendon McCullum arched back and deliberately cut it up and over backward point, almost carried all the way, one bounce over the ropes, upper cut, Brendon McCullum plays that well, more Sachinesque than Sehwagesque that

Guptill is on strike. Lee will open the attackLot of people in - lots of schoolkids too - which is good to see. There was a sharp shower last night but we are all set to go. Nice early morning with the sun just peeping out. Two slips and more of an orthodox field for Brett Lee as Ponting goes up to him and has a word with him before he begins to bowl. This is Srivathsa, who will be bringing it to you to start off with.Both the teams observed a minute's silence before the national anthems for the earthquake victims in Christchurch. They are wearing (even the umpires) black arm-bands as a mark of respect for the people who have lost their lives. Even the Australians had a natural calamity last month - there were flash floods in Queensland which claimed a lot of lives. As Harsha Bhogle said 'there are some things which mean a lot more in life apart from the fact there is a cricket match which is going to be played'.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(w), Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, James Franklin, Jamie How, Scott Styris, Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Hamish Bennett, Tim SoutheeAustralia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, David Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Jason Krejza, Shaun TaitAustralia have won the toss and elected to fieldVettori: This is a very important game, it is also the Chappell-Hadlee game. It has been a disturbing week for us (talking about the earth quakes at Christchurch). We have made one change, How comes in for Oram. We would have opted to bat as well.Ponting: The ball swung quite a bit in the warm ups, we want to take advantage of the moisture around. The cloud cover will aid us as well. We have gone in with a balanced team, the same XI that featured against Zimbabwe.Team news: Australia will go in with the same XI. New Zealand may bring in Jamie How in place of Jacob Oram, which is not confirmed yet.Pitch report: The wicket is dry, the groundsmen have done a tremendous job considering the heavy overnight rain. There are just a few tinges of green, the grass is rolled in nicely, and the seamers will get a little more help. The spinners won't have a big role to play today. Batsmen will still find it easy to bat on.Weather update: There was a bit of rain yesterday, the sun is not fully out yet. The good news is, the covers are off. The conditions are still overcast.Another big game this morning, the geographical neighbours, Australia and New Zealand, lock horns in what promises to be an enthralling encounter. Both teams are coming out of big wins, New Zealand crushed Kenya with a sensational bowling display while an all round effort helped Australia destroy Zimbabwe. Will it be the Black Caps or the Aussies? Who will have the last smile? This is Ajith bringing you all the action along with Karthik, Pradeep and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be back with more updates.by Saurabh SomaniFor many supporters of the New Zealand team, it might seem almost frivolous for the side to be carrying on in the World Cup given the massive tragedy that has hit the country in the past week. There is some truth to the saying though that 'the show must go on'. It always does, and it did for India and England in 2008 after the barbaric 26/11 attacks.
After India's epic victory in the Chennai Test then, Tendulkar had said that if the win helped people feel a little better - maybe just one percent better - then it was worth it. New Zealand will doubtless approach the rest of the World Cup in the same spirit. They will have the world's sympathy with them, and are likely to have heartfelt condolences from the Australians too. However, once the coin is tossed, both teams will be playing only to win.
For Australia, Nagpur will bring back mixed memories. It was here that they lost the Border-Gavaskar trophy to India in what was Sourav Ganguly's last Test match, and also the debut of their current spinner, Jason Krejza. The match was personally rewarding for Krejza who bagged 12 wickets, but collectively not so memorable for Australia.Team NewsAustralia: Australia started slowly against Zimbabwe, but by the time the game had ended, they were convincing victors. Their warm-up games haven't gone too well, and it was vital they got off the blocks with full steam in their opening match. However, it was the bowlers who were more responsible for making the victory a walk in the park rather than the batsmen. The bowling line-up of Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson is certainly a pacy one. When they are on song, it is even a fearsome one. But of the three, it is only Brett Lee who can be relied on to exert some control under all circumstances. Tait and Johnson can either be explosive weapons or liabilities. When you add Jason Krejza into the mix, the potential for either running through a side with quick wickets or leaking runs at an expensive rate is even more clear. However, Ponting will bank on the fact that it is unlikely for all his bowlers to have a bad day together, and if one of them does, he has the firepower to neutralize that. Of greater worry is the Australian batting, and central to that is the form of Ponting himself. It is clear that Ponting's best years as a batsman are behind him, but a key component of Australia doing well has been his runs at Number 3, which have not been forthcoming with the frequency of old. Shane Watson has become the side's most reliable batsman now, but if Australia are to do well consistently, they need Ponting to be firing. There were encouraging signs for them when he hit two fifties in the warm-up games and looked fluent against Zimbabwe before being run-out, but against tougher opposition in the cauldron of a World Cup match, will Ponting's form hold is the key question for Australia.New Zealand: The Black Caps will have the unimaginable challenge of temporarily brushing aside their natural concerns for their fellow country-men and trying to focus on winning a cricket match. Captain Daniel Vettori has admitted that the tragedy was weighing heavily on his men, and understandably so. However, the best way they can deal with it is by a victory on the field. They have a good chance of achieving one too, with the current Australian team being far removed from the invincible outfit that took part in the previous two World Cups. In Daniel Vettori, New Zealand have the perfect candidate to trouble the Aussie batsmen with their known weakness against quality spin, and Vettori has got a good foil in Nathan McCullum. In Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill and Scott Styris they have a good batting core who can take advantage of any laxity on the part of the Aussie bowlers.
New Zealand haven't had the best of times on the cricket field, but their preparations for the World Cup got off to a great start with a knock-out punch delivered to Kenya in a match that got over almost as soon as it started. Cricket-wise, they will take confidence from their demolition of Kenya, but whether the Black Caps manage to put on even a half-decent show against Australia will depend almost entirely on how successfully they can compartmentalize their emotions.Head to Head:Australia and New Zealand have played each other seven times in World Cups. Of those seven meetings Australia have won 5, while New Zealand have won 2. New Zealand's last victory over Australia in a World Cup came in 1999 - but that is no cause for panic. Since 2003 Australia have been unbeaten in World Cups, and thus any victory against them has perforce not happened sooner than 1999.Quotes:"There's been a lot of talk about dew being a major factor but with it being a day game, it shouldn't be much of a factor so it should make the contest a bit more even and fairer," - Ricky Ponting.
"It's a different and a lot tougher challenge though we will take confidence from our comprehensive win against Kenya," - Daniel Vettori.
