ENGLAND:47.1 47.1T Perera to Bopara, out Caught by K Perera!! Oh that's gone very high in the air, Kusal Perera comes under it and ohhhh he hangs onto a stunning catch. He had to dive forward to complete the catch as he misjudged it slightly and in the end, it stays that no team has chased down 300 in Sri Lanka. In joy, Thirimanne jumps on Kusal, who was lying on the ground after taking the catch. Bopara will be very disappointed at missing out on this juicy full ball.

ENGLAND:15.1 T Perera to Bell, out Caught by M Jayawardene!! The ball was doing something off the deck for Perera and that has seeded enough doubts in Bell's mind and he wasn't sure with his footwork. Short of a length delivery just bouncing a touch extra, Bell ends up poking at it and a thick outside edge is snaffled by the man at first slip. Credit to Mathews for employing a slip. That ends a fine 56-run stand and England will have to rebuild again. Bell c M Jayawardene b T Perera 35(35) [4s-3]T Perera to Bell, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ENGLAND:6.1 Dilshan to Cook, out Lbw!! Is Cook going to review it again? It's Palliyaguruge, the umpire again and Cook simply walks back. What an inspired bowing change by Mathews. Dilshan strikes first ball and that looked absolutely plumb. After both of his decisions were overturned, the umpire thought for a long time but this time he was spot on. Nothing but a flighted delivery on the stumps from the round the wicket, Cook fails to defend, the ball hits him in line with middle and the Hawk-Eye suggests that the ball would have brushed the stumps. Cook lbw b Dilshan 10(17)Dilshan to Cook, THATS OUT!!

ENGLAND:0.3 Mathews to Cook, no run, good length delivery nipping back in, Cook leans forward and tries to block, misses and is hit in line with middle and off. He was a long way forward and that saved himCook has been given out LBW, but he's sent it upstairs. That looked pretty close. Height is the only issue. Here we go. It's a fair delivery, ball pitching in line, remember the onfield call is OUT, so the ball has to only clip the stumps. Well, Hawk-Eye says it bounced too much and he survives.

No team has chased down 300 in Sri Lanka.Do join us back in a short while for the second half. And let us hope that the weather stays fine.The English bowlers sprayed the ball all over the shop and messed up by overdoing the slower balls. They bowled as many as 17 wides - an indication of their ill-discipline. Will it come back to haunt England?A daunting chase awaits Cook and Co. Dilshan and KJP set up the platform with a strong 120-run opening union before MJ scored a fifty of his own.

Cook has a pep talk before they disperse to their fielding positions. Woakes to bowl the first ball of the series. He has two slips in place to assist him..There was a bit of confusion as to which Perera was playing, it is Thisara and not Dilurwan, who gets a game today.Mathews: "We would have bowled first as well. There will be something in the wicket, especially in the first 10 overs. It was a tough tour in India, we need to flush that out of our system. After the India tour, we have an idea as to who is going to the World Cup. The bowlers are inexperienced, but we have Rangana Herath back in the side."Cook: "We are going to have a bowl. It is hard to tell about the forecast. The pitch seems tacky, hence we will bowl first. First of all we have to concentrate on this game. Dropping Alex was a tough decision, we needed an extra bowler in these conditions. Finny could not pass the fitness test this morning. We need to adapt to these conditions and then think about the World Cup."Pitch Report: "The groundsmen have done a great job. It is cloudy and the forecast is for rain. The pitch is nice and hard. The captain winning the toss will want the insert the opposition in", says Russel ArnoldTeams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Dhammika Prasad, Rangana Herath, Ajantha MendisEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, James Tredwell, Harry GurneyEngland have won the toss and have opted to fieldGood news folks! Play will start at 15:30 local time, which means the toss is 10 minutes away. There are no overs reduced and it will be a 50-over game.England players are out in the middle warming up. The groundstaff are working relentlessly to clear the water logged on the covers. The covers from the square have been removed and the rest are being taken off slowly.And if the game begins but can't be finished today, the proceedings will resume from that stage tomorrow. Hmmm, looks like its going to be that kind of a day.The rain has ceased and the covers are being peeled off. The two umpires are out in the middle, discussing the playing conditions with Cook and Mathews. No official word on the starting time, yet. If rain ruins this day, play will begin tomorrow and overs will be docked depending upon the conditions.Toss and start of play have been delayed. Stay tuned for more updates..The horrendous injury to Phil Hughes has shook the cricketing fraternity. The news is that he is still in a critical condition. Our thoughts and prayers are with Hughes.The latest update is that the entire ground is covered. Tomorrow's a reserve day. With more rain forecast during the series, Sri Lankan officials have set aside reserve days for five of the seven matches.This could possibly be Sanga's last series at home. By the way, England are further depleted with Finn picking up a groin strain.Weather Watch: Colombo has experienced showers in the past couple of days and the north-east monsoon continues to be a cause for concern. It may be recalled that the second tour game was abandoned. As Mahela tweeted overnight, let us hope that the rains stay away.The hosts have dropped Kula and Chandimal for the first 3 ODIs while Kandamby makes a comeback after a three-year hiatus. Meanwhile, opening the batting for England, Mo Ali cracked a breezy fifty in the tour game, but Hales continues to be the front-runner to partner Alastair Cook at the top of the order. James Taylor, who wasn't in the picture for the India ODIs will be looking to make a statement and firm up his spot for the World Cup. With Jimmy and Broad missing out due to injury, the onus is on Steve Finn to lead the attack. During his first media briefing in Colombo, Cook spoke of this being a 'revenge' series. Yes, there is quite a lot to look forward to.This long-drawn 7-match series offers an opportunity for both sides to analyse their talent pool and sort out the ideal combination for the World Cup. Greetings and welcome to the series opener.After suffering an ignominious 5-0 whitewash at the hands of India, Sri Lanka return to home comforts. England haven't done all that well either in ODIs. Cook and Co. floundered against the Islanders before the Indians gave them more food for thought with an emphatic 3-1 series win.Preview:England will look to settle scores against Sri Lanka after their bad-tempered clash earlier this year when the two sides meet in a pre-World Cup one-day series from Wednesday. The seven-match tour has been spiced up by comments from England captain Alastair Cook that his team will try to exact revenge for the Test and one-day defeats at home.Cook's status as captain came under heavy pressure after the 1-0 Test defeat, and tempers frayed in the ODIs when off-spinner Sachithra Senanayake controversially ran out Jos Buttler before delivering a ball. "There is a World Cup at the end of it, but we are here to try and win this series," Cook said on arrival. "I think we owe you (Sri Lanka) a little bit of revenge."The 'Mankaded' dismissal by Senanayake, since suspended for an illegal bowling action, is considered to be against cricket's spirit of fair play. But Sri Lanka insisted Buttler was earlier warned for backing up, and senior pro Mahela Jayawardene lashed out at Cook for questioning Senanayake's run-out.Meanwhile Sri Lanka are smarting from this month's 5-0 thrashing in India in a series that was hastily arranged after the West Indies abandoned their Indian tour over a pay dispute. Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews insisted the matches will be used to recover from the morale-sapping loss and find the right combination for the World Cup starting in February."We need to get back into our groove," Mathews said. "We want to look at players whom we think need to be looked at and whom we think will go on the World Cup. It's very important that we sort out our bowlers and also the batting order. By the end of the series we should have a very clear idea of whom we want to take to the World Cup."Both teams are grouped together in the preliminary stage of the World Cup and will feature on the opening day on February 14, with Sri Lanka playing New Zealand and England facing Australia. The upcoming series, which opens in Colombo, provides both teams a chance to strike form -- provided the weather does not play spoilsport.The prevailing north-east monsoon over the island has already forced one of the two warm-up matches to be abandoned, leaving the tourists short of match practice. With more rain forecast during the series, Sri Lankan officials have set aside reserve days for five of the seven matches. "It's not ideal, is it?" England batsman Ian Bell said. "But I suppose, on this tour, we're going to get interrupted by rain all the way through."England have lost 11 of 18 one-dayers this year, including a 4-1 drubbing in Australia which co-hosts the World Cup with New Zealand in February-March.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, James Tredwell, Steven Finn, Harry Gurney, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Ben Stokes, James TaylorSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Rangana Herath, Shaminda Eranga, Dhammika Prasad, Thilina Kandamby, Lahiru Gamage, Ajantha Mendis, Dilruwan PereraLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
