IRELAND:8.1  Sarel Burger to Ed Joyce, no run, slower one on the pads, softly turned to short mid wicket
IRELAND:7.6  R van Schoor to Stirling, FOUR, 26 ball fifty for Stirling and he is chuffed. This one was an uppish cut to the right of a flying point, he had no chance and the ball zooted away to the deep point fence in a flash. Ireland almost there

IRELAND:7.4  R van Schoor to Stirling, 3 runs, slower one again, Stirling waits for it and forces it to sweeper cover, three taken by the time cover runs after it to stop it

IRELAND:6.3  Sarel Burger to Stirling, 2 runs, Stirling is lucky again. This time point diving forward couldn't get his hands around the ball. The leading edge and it almost carried to the point fielder
IRELAND:6.2  Sarel Burger to Stirling, no run, backs away and chips it half-heartedly, it falls well short of mid wicket
IRELAND:6.1  Sarel Burger to Stirling, no run, Stirling moves outside leg and the ball catches him on the padSarel Burger, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack

IRELAND:4.6  L Klazinga to Stirling, 1 run, retains the strike with a run to long on
IRELAND:4.5  L Klazinga to Stirling, FOUR, on a good length outside off, Stirling just got forward and lifted it up and over mid off, the ball races away on this fast outfield and just to emphasise his impressive strokeplay Jackers hopes someone from the IPL franchisees are watching this innings
IRELAND:4.4  L Klazinga to Stirling, FOUR, poor bowling and that is easy pickings for Stirling. Full and sliding down leg, glanced away past the diving short fine leg. Stirling continues unflustered
IRELAND:4.3  L Klazinga to Ed Joyce, 1 run, gets forward and eases it to long on to get off the markEd Joyce, left handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:4.2  L Klazinga to Porterfield, out Caught by Sarel Burger!! Well, well. Against the run of play, Ireland lose a wicket. Flicked in the air to the left of mid wicket who snaffles a smart take. One captain takes out the other. Porterfield c Sarel Burger b L Klazinga 20(16) [4s-4] L Klazinga to Porterfield, THATS OUT!!

IRELAND:3.5  Geldenhuys to Stirling, FOUR, didn't time the hack properly, but got it over and wide of mid off. Good enough for a boundary
IRELAND:3.4  Geldenhuys to Porterfield, leg byes, 1 run, looked very close, if there was no inside edge onto the pads, I can't see how Porterfield has survived that. Slow, short and kept low on the stumps, Porterfield missed the pull and it seemed to strike him in front of middle. The umpire though thinks otherwise
IRELAND:3.3  Geldenhuys to Porterfield, no run, full outside off, driven to mid off, straight to the fielder
IRELAND:3.2  Geldenhuys to Porterfield, no run, turned to square leg
IRELAND:3.1  Geldenhuys to Porterfield, FOUR, that is poor stuff, seriously poor from Viljoen. Short and on middle, Porterfield pulls it to the left of deep backward square, there is a fielder running across from fine leg to cover, but Viljoen's parry beats the other man and crosses the ropes. Namibia simply cannot afford such basic errors
IRELAND:3.1  Geldenhuys to Porterfield, wide, poor ball, slower delivery down legNamibia badly need a couple of wickets if not more, if they harbor any hopes of winning this game

IRELAND:1.5  Geldenhuys to Stirling, 1 run, ugly swipe and inside edges it to short fine leg
IRELAND:1.4  Geldenhuys to Stirling, FOUR, too full outside off, Stirling just opened the face and squeezed it between a couple of fielders at point. Brilliantly played
IRELAND:1.3  Geldenhuys to Stirling, no run, missing leg as Geldenhuys goes up in appeal for an LBW. Pitched in line and moves back in, beats Stirling's attempted hoick. Would've gone down though
IRELAND:1.2  Geldenhuys to Porterfield, 1 run, good fielding at mid on, prevents the boundary. It was wristed from outside off and only a diving stop saved the bowler some punishment
IRELAND:1.1  Geldenhuys to Porterfield, no run, full and swinging away, Porterfield squeezes it out to coverHendrik W Geldenhuys, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
IRELAND:0.6  Snyman to Stirling, no run, Snyman cramps Stirling up with a ball on the stumps, defended back to the bowler

IRELAND:0.4  Snyman to Stirling, no run, good length on the stumps, Stirling confidently defends it back down the track
IRELAND:0.3  Snyman to Porterfield, 1 run, now opens the face of the bat and steers it down to third man
IRELAND:0.2  Snyman to Porterfield, FOUR, that's 2 in 2! Snyman goes full and outside off, Porterfield just lofts it over mid off, the fielder ran back and put in a dive, but to no avail
IRELAND:0.1  Snyman to Porterfield, FOUR, that's the way to start an innings, slightly short on the stumps, from round the wicket as well, Porterfield rocks back and pulls it over square leg. Brilliant way to begin the inningsPorterfield and Stirling are at the crease. Porterfield is on strike. Snyman will open the attackNamibia have disappointed big time. They never got going and a score of just 94 simply doesn't seem enough against a confident Irish side. Unless they produce something special with the ball and in the field. Ireland are very close to sealing their berth for the World T20 championships in Sri Lanka. Do join us shortly for the chase.1

Caught!!
NAMIBIA:4.2  Trent Johnston to van der Westhuizen, SIX, What a shot! Just the kind of ball where you can free your arms and van der Westhuizen did just that. He went after a full and wide one outside off and deposited the lofted extra cover drive into the stands

NAMIBIA:3.4  Rankin to Snyman, no run, unplayable! Simply too good for Snyman who was a wry smile on his face and has a chat with van der Westhuizen after that. This one angled in and then bounced a tad, opened up Snyman and went over the off stump. How it didn't hit the stumps will always remain a mystery. Great bowling from Rankin
NAMIBIA:3.3  Rankin to Snyman, no run, beauty! Snyman was sucked into the forward push and this one held its line outside off to beat him. So close to the edge that one

NAMIBIA:2.2  Trent Johnston to R van Schoor, out Lbw!! Dead! R van Schoor was shuffling across a lot in his innings and eventually pays the price. This one moved in a shade and struck him in front of off and middle. Once the batsman missed, he had no chance. Trent Johnston roars in delight. R van Schoor lbw b Trent Johnston 1(5) Trent Johnston to R van Schoor, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
NAMIBIA:2.1  Trent Johnston to van der Westhuizen, byes, 1 run, poor stuff from Gary Wilson, he fumbles a regulation take after a wild slog from van der Westhuizen ensured that he missed the ball. Trent Johnston isn't happy with his keeper for that sloppy piece of work

NAMIBIA:0.2  Trent Johnston to van der Westhuizen, no run, peach, but poorly played by van der Westhuizen, he was in no position to defend and was lucky that it didn't kiss the edge. Was close to the off stump as well, kept a bit low too

Trent Johnston will open the attackPorterfield: We pretty much knew what we wanted to do and also what they wanted to do (talking about the toss). There will be a bit of pressure as it is a big game and we are glad to be in this position. We've been lucky to have played in World Cups and we would look to get into another one. We are going in unchanged.Burger: Wicket looks quite nice to bat on first so we will look to set a target and go on from there. We would like to keep the momentum going. Obviously it is a lot harder when we are playing such a big game like this. We've added an extra bowler.Pitch report: Lovely looking pitch it is. A new pitch is being used for today. A tinge of green not a lot. The new ball will do a bit. No signs of any cracks or any sort of deterioration. Basically a good batting surface signs off Jackers.Teams:Ireland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, Andrew Poynter, Max Sorensen, George Dockrell, Boyd Rankin, Trent Johnston, Andrew WhiteNamibia (Playing XI): Raymond van Schoor, Louis van der Westhuizen, Gerrie Snyman, Craig George Williams, Sarel Burger(c), Nicholaas Scholtz, Ian Opperman, Christi Viljoen, Merwe Erasmus(w), Louis Klazinga, Hendrik W GeldenhuysNamibia have won the toss and elected to batA warm welcome to the preliminary final between Ireland and Namibia.
