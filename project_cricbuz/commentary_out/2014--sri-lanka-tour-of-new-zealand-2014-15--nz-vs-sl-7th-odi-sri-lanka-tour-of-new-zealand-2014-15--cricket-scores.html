Anderson was good with his variations for the hosts and he picked up three wickets, while Southee bowled well to scalp two. Take a break and join us back for New Zealand's reply.4

Sri Lanka have made 4 changes - Prasanna, Kulasekara, Eranga and Chameera replace Jeevan Mendis, Dhammika, Herath and Lakmal.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Lahiru Thirimanne(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Nuwan Kulasekara, Shaminda Eranga, Dushmantha ChameeraNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghanSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batThere is news coming in that Brendon McCullum is not playing this game and Kane Williamson will captain the side in his absence.Hello and welcome to the final ODI between New Zealand and Sri Lanka. The Black Caps will look to finish the series with a 5-1 scoreline. On the other hand, Sri Lanka would want to pull one back to end the series on a high. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.The Sri Lankan bowlers failed to bowl well once again. The Kiwis were especially severe on Thisara Perera, who went for 86 runs in his 10 overs. The visitors didn't do well with the bat either. Apart from Kumar Sangakkara, who made 81, no other batter could even reach the score of 30. In fact, the Lankans lost their last 7 wickets for 49 runs.The last game at Dunedin was a one sided affair as New Zealand sealed the series with a big 120-run win. For the hosts, Ross Taylor finally came back to form. Both Taylor and Williamson put on a 117-run stand for the third wicket and helped the Kiwis go past 300. However, both batsmen narrowly missed out on their respective centuries.PreviewBefore Sri Lanka's tour of New Zealand in December 2014, Sri Lanka had reasons to smile. They had defeated England 5-2 at home and there was extra incentive heading into the trip as they would get plenty of time to adjust to the conditions just before the start of the ICC Cricket World Cup. However, in the space of two months, things have fallen apart for Sri Lanka. They lost the Test series 2-0 while they have been hammered in the ODI series. With the final match on Thursday in Wellington, Sri Lanka have one final chance to end their dismal tour with a consolatory win.For New Zealand, every batsman in the team has made a significant contribution at some point of time in the series while the bowling continues to be disciplined. For the home team, the key is to sustain consistency and maintain it over the next two months.New ZealandThere is aggression at the top, solidity in the middle order and there are finishers who can end the game on a high. With these factors present in the batting, it is not surprising that New Zealand have achieved success for the past two years. Craig McMillan, their batting coach, highlighted that all batsmen have got a score to their name. "Its just foot on the throat, continuing to win, winning breeds confidence. The last game in Dunedin was our most complete performance across all three disciplines. There are areas we want to get better in, so were not satisfied, and it would be nice to finish off a tour wherewe'vebeen pretty dominant with a win," he said.The bowling looks in great shape although they might make some changes in the spin department. Daniel Vettori, who recently became the most-capped ODI player for New Zealand, has not taken a wicket in four matches but has bowled economically. Nathan McCullum might get a chance to enhance his credentials in Wellington while Tim Southee could come back after being rested in Dunedin.Probable XI1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (c), 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Grant Elliott, 6 Corey Anderson, 7 Luke Ronchi (wk), 8 Nathan McCullum/Daniel Vettori, 9 Tim Southee/Kyle Mills, 10 Mitchell McClenaghan, 11 Trent BoultSri LankaNothing has gone right for the visitors in this series. Catches have been dropped; the batting is still heavily reliant on Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. They have also let the initiative slip after having their opponents in a precarious situation. Lasith Malinga's continued absence has hurt them immensely and their problems have mounted ahead of the Wellington ODI. Rangana Herath will miss this match due to personal reasons while Angelo Mathews remains in doubt due to a hamstring injury.The string of poor results has forced Sri Lanka's chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya to lament that he was not happy with the team's preparations in New Zealand. "There are areas to be improved and in the next few weeks I hope we can sort them out. There are aspects to improve every day," he said. Jayasuriya also pointed out that the team management had made a big blunder by opting for Dimuth Karunaratne as opener. Sri Lanka will have to pull their socks up in all departments if they have to turn the corner.Probable XI1 Lahiru Thirimanne (c), 2 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Dimuth Karunaratne, 6 Dinesh Chandimal, 7 Thisara Perera, 8 Jeevan Mendis, 9 Sachithra Senanayake, 10 Dhammika Prasad/Nuwan Kulasekara, 11 Suranga LakmalTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Lahiru Thirimanne(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dinesh Chandimal, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Dhammika Prasad, Suranga Lakmal, Shaminda Eranga, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Sachithra Senanayake, Nuwan KulasekaraNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Grant Elliott, Daniel Vettori, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent Boult, Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Tom Latham, Matt Henry, Tim SoutheeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
