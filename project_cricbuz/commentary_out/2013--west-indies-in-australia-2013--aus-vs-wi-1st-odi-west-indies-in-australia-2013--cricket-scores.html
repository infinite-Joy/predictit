WEST INDIES:3.6  Starc to Kieran Powell, no run, an appeal for lbw but not given. Very full and swinging away from leg stump line, Powell walks across and misses a flick and is hit low on the pads. That looked quite close
WEST INDIES:3.5  Starc to Kieran Powell, FOUR, lovely drive. Not easy against this swing but he has done it superbly, fuller length and outside off, Powell gets to the pitch of it and plays a perfect off drive between extra cover and mid off
WEST INDIES:3.4  Starc to Kieran Powell, no run, beaten. The outswinger again, pitches on off and moves away, Powell's defence is beaten

WEST INDIES:2.6  Clint McKay to Kieran Powell, 1 run, in the air but safe, on the pads and Powell clips it away uppishly but wide of square leg

WEST INDIES:2.4  Clint McKay to Kieran Powell, no run, back of a length and angled away, Powell leaves it alone

WEST INDIES:0.4  Clint McKay to Kieran Powell, no run, good length and outside off, Powell lets it go
WEST INDIES:0.3  Clint McKay to Kieran Powell, no run, huge appeal for lbw but going down the leg side I guess. Full and swinging in, starts from leg and hits him on the pads, would have gone down with the angle

WEST INDIES:0.2  Clint McKay to Gayle, wide, short of length and wide outside off, given an extra

Anyway, Gayle to take strike.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Usman Khawaja, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Matthew Wade(w), Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Clint McKayWest Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Kieran Powell, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Sunil Narine, Jason Holder, Kemar RoachJames Faulkner will make his debut for Australia today. Let's see how he goes against the power-packed West Indies line up. Andre Russell misses out for West Indies. He was suffering from a sore knee and that could be the reason. Jason Holder will make his debut.West Indies have won the toss and elected to batHello and welcome to the coverage of the first ODI between West Indies and Australia. It's a 5 match series and the first 2 ODIs will be played at Perth. Australia have a lot of new faces, while West Indies have a relatively settled ODI line up. Ramnaresh Sarwan is back in the West Indies side after a long gap, so let's see how he goes. Stay tuned for toss and team updates.PreviewAll the talk in the Australian cricketing fraternity at the moment is to do with either Shane Warne's radical suggestions to improve cricket in the country, or the Test series against India which starts on February 22nd. But there is another series to be played before that - West Indies have arrived for a 5 match ODI series which will be followed by a T20 International game. West Indies are no pushovers, especially in the shorter formats of the game. With Australia resting some key players and testing out new faces, it will be a great chance for the visitors to utilise and win a series on Australian soil.Australia: Australia's selectors have the Champions Trophy, to be played in June, in mind and have continued with the rotation policy despite some criticism following their relatively poor show against Sri Lanka. The rotation policy and injuries to key players (Moises Henriques and David Warner) gives a great chance for some young players to make some spots their own; the likes of Aaron Finch, James Faulkner and Usman Khawaja will be keen to make use of the opportunity. Finch has played 2 ODIs, Khawaja one while Faulkner will make his debut in the first ODI against West Indies. The fresh faces is also a test for skipper Clarke, as he has to manage a very young side against a competent West Indies unit.The bowling attack looks a bit more experienced. Starc has cemented his place in the team while Mitchell Johnson has become a first choice bowler again. McKay, Faulkner and all-rounder Maxwell complete the rest of the line up.West Indies: All the attention around the West Indies team is around the return of Ramnaresh Sarwan. After more than 18 months, which was spent in a battle with the board, the sturdy right hander is all set to make a comeback to the national team. His presence will be much needed, as West Indies are without Marlon Samuels who is injured. Chris Gayle has not been in the best of forms recently but he will know that he is only one big innings away. Andre Russell is suffering from a sore knee but is expected to be fit in time for the match.The bowling line up is without Kemar Roach for the first ODI as the pacer is at home for personal reasons. That puts a lot of pressure on Tino Best and the visitors will look up to their all-rounders Sammy, Pollard and Russell to do a lot of bowling. It's also very vital for Sunil Narine to prove his ability on tracks that don't assist spinners.The last ODI series between these two sides ended in a 2-2 tied result, showing how tough it is to pick a favourite. Australia have the home advantage, but West Indies are not going to be an easy team to beat in the shorter formats.
