The seamers accounted for two early wickets and then the introduction of Saeed Ajmal saw Pakistan taking full control of the innings. He picked up 3 wickets in quick succession to deny the visitors. Shahid Afridi supported him very well at the other end but the hosts couldn't prevent a gritty fifty from Wayne Parnell who put on a record 9th wicket stand (52 runs) in ODIs at Sharjah with Lonwabo Tsotsobe. He has given his bowlers something to work with even though the target is not a big one. Pakistan shouldn't have a problem chasing this down but you never know. These low totals could be very tricky. Do not miss out on the action, join us back for Pakistan's run chase.4

SOUTH AFRICA:12.2  Ajmal to Graeme Smith, no run, flighted delivery outside off stump, Smith looks to defend but the ball spins away and beats the oustide edge, Pakistan were really confident that they had their man. But there was no clear evidence for the third umpire to overturn the on-field call. Misbah & Co. cannot believe itPakistan have reviewed for a caught behind shout. Smith is the man in question. Umar Akmal was very confident. No problems with the no-ball, remember there is no hot-spot which means the third umpire will have to rely on the stump-mic. The original call is NOT OUT! We can't pick up any deviation or sound, what is it going to be? Smith survives!
