Mathews is armed with the new ball with two slips to assist him.Things could have been worse for Mathews & Co. but credit to Dhammika as well for fighting it out with the captain with a 54-run stand for the 9th wicket. Can Rahane and Dhawan get India off to another good start? Or will Sri Lanka make early inroads to put the hosts under pressure. An interesting chase is on the cards. Join us back in a while for the Indian innings.So a competitive total from the visitors. A target of 275 is certainly not going to be easy to chase. Virak Kohli will be happy with his bowlers though. Both Ishant and Umesh started off very well. However, Sri Lanka recovered in the form of Sangakkara and Dilshan. Axar Patel came on and removed the latter, before Ashwin accounted for Jayawardene. Sanga added 90 runs with Mathews before being dismissed and the skipper batted sensibly to ensure that Sri Lanka got a good total on the board. Axar was the pick of the bowlers, while Ashwin too pulled things back despite conceding 18 runs in his first over.4

Indian players are going through their catching drill near the pitch.The average first innings score in Ahmedabad since 2000 reads 259.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Suraj Randiv, Dhammika Prasad, Lahiru GamageIndia (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli(c), Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravindra Jadeja, Akshar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ishant Sharma, Umesh YadavVirat Kohli: "We would have liked to bat first as well. The ball will turn a fair amount more than it did in Cuttack. The dew might not be a big factor. It will now be an even contest between the bat and ball. Ravindra Jadeja comes in for Varun Aaron. That's the only change for us."Angelo Mathews: "We will have a bat first. It looks a very good pitch and we want to put runs on the board. We did not have a good outing in the last game, but we want to set it right today. Kushal Janith replaces Tharanga."Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batThe two captains walk out for the toss. 'Heads' is the call from Angelo.Pitch report: "The grass is quite solid and hard. The ball will come onto the bat nicely. There is enough to encourage the fast bowlers early on, there will be good lateral movement. There will be some help for the seamers because of the covering of grass. Despite that, it will get better for batting" reckon Michael Holding and Sunil GavaskarThe toss is imminent.Local lad, Axar Patel, looks set to play his first ODI in front of an enthusiastic home crowd, but whether Jaddu sits out again or takes Ashwin's berth remains to be seen.India's openers, Dhawan and Rahane, built much of the edifice for the mammoth win in Cuttack, scoring centuries each. Ishant Sharma, also shone, recording his hitherto career-best figures in ODI cricket. Kohli's captaincy, highlighted by the aggressive move of taking the batting powerplay early, was another major plus. Meanwhile, Karnataka all-rounder, Stuart Binny, has been drafted in as a replacement for the injured Varun Aaron, who will miss this game and also the third ODI.Can the World T20I champs get on an even keel and draw level with the hosts? Or will India continue their fine form? Greetings and welcome to the second ODI between the Asian top dogs. Nuwan Kulasekara is likely to return and lend experience to the bowling attack. With Tharanga also struggling to get going, the visitors may recall Kushal Perera. Sri Lanka's batting though can assume dangerous proportions if the big three - Sanga, Mahela and Dilshan - come good.After being outplayed by India in all departments in the opening ODI, Sril Lanka will be itching to shake off the rust and hit back. Though Angelo Mathews pinned the blame on the batsmen for the dismal loss, the bowlers and fielders were also found wanting. Sri Lanka's fringe players will have to step up if they are to firm up their spots for the World Cup, which is exactly 99 days away.PreviewAfter starting the series with a crushing victory, an upbeat India will aim to maintain their stranglehold over an under-prepared Sri Lanka when they meet in the second ODI at Ahmedabad on Thursday.Needless to say that India will be starting as overwhelming favourites at the Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera, having walloped the opponents by 169 runs in the opening match.India went into the series opener with their confidence boosted by back-to-back victories over West Indies at Delhi and Dharamsala, after a shock loss at Kochi in the series opener.Coming on as last-minute substitutes after West Indies pulled out of the series due to a payment dispute with their Board, nothing went right for the Islanders, who had to leave their fitness training programme midway to get ready for the India tour, in the Cuttack opener.The Lankan bowlers allowed the Indian openers - Ajinkya Rahane and Shikhar Dhawan - to put on a double-century (231-run) stand, which also happened to be the third best for the country for the first wicket and was the platform for the tall Indian total.A dropped catch reprieved the left-handed Dhawan early on and after India raked up an imposing 363 for 5, built mainly on the stroke-filled, individual hundreds from the two openers, the Lankan batting caved in meekly on a low bouncing wicket.For Lanka to make a match of it tomorrow, it's imperative they restrict the rampaging Indian batting line-up from running up another big total if the hosts bat first.It's in bowling that Lanka appear the weaker side especially without the services of slinger, Lasith Malinga and left-arm spinner Rangana Herath who are not with the touring party.The Sri Lanka batting-order has vast experience in the big three - Tilakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene - apart from Upul Tharanga, but a few of these batsmen have to fire big in unison to match the Indian batting might.India have fewer problems facing them in familiar home conditions. Rahane and Dhawan, having laid a perfect platform for the big total in the first game, are looking good, and with an in-form Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina to follow behind, the home team sports a formidable top-order.Dhawan, incidentally, is 124 short of completing 2000 runs in this format. In the absence of rested regular skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Indian lower-order does not possess the same firepower.It's here that Sri Lanka's slender hopes lie of dismissing the top four without allowing for too many runs to be put on the board and then getting a chance to nip steadily at the lower-order.The hosts' pace bowling attack has seen a change following the leg injury sustained by Varun Aaron at Cuttack in his fifth over, which he could not complete. Aaron has been declared unfit for tomorrow's game and the one after that on November 9 and has been replaced by Karnataka all-rounder, Stuart Binny.Mumbai's Dhawal Kulkarni is also an option for the think-tank as the third seam bowler, but Stuart Binny, with better batting credentials, is also in with a chance.The Lankan batsmen struggled against Axar Patel, but the inexperienced left-arm spinner, included in place of Ravindra Jadeja, can expect a better battle from the likes of veteran batsmen Sangakkara and Jayawardene in the second ODI.Ravichandran Ashwin, though not looking at his best, would be his foil with part-timer Raina also expected to chip in if needed.India lost the last ODI game they played at this ground, against the West Indies by 16 runs nearly three years ago after tripping the then reigning champions Australia in the World Cup quarter-final in March, 2011, at this venue on way to the coveted title.Otherwise, India don't have an enviable record at this ground, having won only 6 out of 14 encounters they had figured in at the Motera Stadium, which should encourage the visitors. India did not feature in the other 9 matches held at this ground. This ground generally sports an easy-paced track and things are expected to continue in this respect.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Suraj Randiv, Dhammika Prasad, Lahiru Gamage, Nuwan Kulasekara, Chaturanga de Silva, Kushal Janith Perera, Niroshan DickwellaIndia (From): Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli(c), Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Stuart Binny, Akshar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhawal Kulkarni, Amit Mishra, Murali VijayLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
