N McCullum will open the attackThe Indian openers are out there. Right then, we are all set to go for the chase...258 looks to be a par score. Advantage India? Considering the talk about the dew, and with the Indian youngsters wanting to prove a point or two, it looks like India are the favorites to win this. Having said that, batting under lights is never easy. And for the Kiwis, it's Dan the Man who will hold the key. The top order didn't click for the Kiwis and it was two men, Guptill and Styris, who helped the Kiwis post a respectable total. Guptill was given out caught behind but replays showed that he hadn't nicked it. Vettori, who has shown a lot of promise with the bat of late chipped in with useful runs in the later overs as he and Styris scored freely despite the Indian bowlers being real good in their variations. Sreesanth, the pick of the bowlers for India today, came back and picked up Styris and Vettori in successive deliveries in the 46th over which did really dent the Kiwi hopes of a huge total. Will the young Indian side chase this down and take a 2-0 lead? Or will Mills, Vettori and Co. dent the hopes of the Indian fans? Join us back at 6:40 PM IST for the remainder of the game.4

Guptill is on strike. Nehra will open the attackThe players are out on the field, the stands are almost full. Lots of buzz around the stadium, let's get underway.Ravi Shastri: There will be dew, I also spoke to Gambhir before the toss and he feels the dew will be substantial. A chemical will be sprayed during the supper break and before the start of the game which will look to supress the dew. Every team must go in with two best spinners, and as far as the WC is concerned, If Bhajji and Ashwin are their two best spinners, go in with them.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Jamie How, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Kane Williamson, Scott Styris, Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Gareth Hopkins(w), Kyle Mills, Andy McKay, Tim SoutheeIndia (Playing XI): Gautam Gambhir(c), Murali Vijay, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravichandran Ashwin, S Sreesanth, Ashish Nehra, Munaf PatelVettori: Brendon has unfortunately not made it to the eleven. Myself and Southee come in for Elliot and Tuffey. We are not reading too much into the dew. We can't give excuses, we would like to bat first.Gambhir: Dew is a big factor, we have good spinners in the side and we would like to bowl first. It's always nice to be one-up in the series and looking forward to keep the winning momentum going. We can't afford to be complacent when playing for the country. We are going in with the same side.India have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch report: There are a few cracks opening up. Out of the 8 ODIs played here, five of them have been won by the team batting second. The dew will play a major role, batting second will be much better on this wicket. The ball will come onto the bat, the batsmen will enjoy their strokeplay out there feels Simon Doull.1:50 PM IST: There has been some talk about the dew, the captain who wins the toss may bowl first. Particularly India, who have to rely on their part-timers to bowl ten overs. We are ten minutes away from the toss. Don't go away.Simon Doull: Vettori is back, the Kiwis needed that badly. McCullum, once he's in, he has to keep wickets. They can't afford to play him just as a batsman. So they may give him another game's rest and then try and fit him in the eleven. Gambhir has been pulling the wool over a few people's eyes, I think they will stick with the same side. It's not right to change the winning combination. I do believe, Ross Taylor should bat at No. 3 for the Black Caps. He's their best player and he needs to step up and perform. It looks like a bat first wicket, but there has been a lot of talk about the dew. If the ball becomes too wet, it will be tough for the spinners to grip the ball.After a comprehensive win in the first ODI, the Indians, led by Gautam Gambhir, will be looking to gain further advantage by outperforming the Kiwis at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. Vettori has been declared fit and he will play today, which gives the Black Caps a much needed boost. Will the young guns of India help the hosts take a 2-0 lead in this 5 match series? Or will the Kiwis bounce back and show that they are a lot more competitive than their recent ODI form suggests? This is Ajith and I'll take you through the day along with my colleagues Sid V and Srivathsa. Stay logged in for more updates.by Saurabh SomaniNothing much has changed ahead of the second ODI between India and New Zealand, except that India have the comfort of being 1-0 up. The Indian team is still a young one, lacking its usual stars, and the new faces still have the opportunity to make themselves more permanent in the selectors' eyes. New Zealand remain a competitive side, albeit one that seems to have perfected the art of competing without actually winning.
The big question for New Zealand will be whether two of their principal match-winners in Daniel Vettori and Brendon McCullum are fit or not. Their absence cost the team dearly in the first ODI, and even though the end margin of defeat wasn't as big as it threatened to be, there is little doubt that the presence of both veterans would have probably got New Zealand closer or even possibly seen them win the match.
New Zealand have also suffered a blow with the injury to Daryll Tuffey ruling him out of the series. They have back-up seamers in the form of Southee and Franklin, but if Vettori is also fit, then they might consider going in with two spinners in their eleven with Nathan McCullum partnering Vettori, while Kyle Mills and Andy McKay handle the new ball duties. New Zealand's assortment of all-rounders and bits-and-pieces players means they have ample men to fill in the fifth bowler's slot with Styris, Williamson, and Grant Elliott all capable of turning their arms over.
Their top-order batting will have to show vast improvement over the first ODI though, if they entertain any hopes of drawing level with India.
The hosts will be going into the match in a confident and fairly relaxed frame of mind, but it's unlikely that there will be any hint of complacency in the ranks, given that most players will want to make strong cases for themselves for inclusion in the World Cup squad. There are a few areas that India will want to rectify, chief among them being their death-overs problem. In the past, bowlers have tended to give away too many runs in the death overs, but in the last match, it was the batsmen who were at fault. Virat Kohli had given the lower middle order an excellent platform, but it was squandered. While the eventual total proved enough, it will not prove to be enough against a team stronger than the eleven that New Zealand had fielded. The only one who couldn't be faulted for his innings apart from Kohli was Yusuf Pathan. Yusuf came in during the 41st over, and saw four wickets fall within 8 overs. That he made a quickfire 29 was valuable, and had the other men hung around, it could easily have been more. Both Gambhir and Vijay were guilty of throwing away starts, while Yuvraj and Raina didn't look comfortable for any extended periods.
The silver lining for India was undoubtedly Kohli's performance, and he is fast assuming the mantle of the mainstay of the batting line-up. India will need more substantial contributions from the rest of the top-order though, if they want the cushion that a 2-0 lead in the 5-match series will give them.Teams:India (From): Gautam Gambhir(c), Murali Vijay, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravichandran Ashwin, S Sreesanth, Ashish Nehra, Munaf Patel, Jaidev Unadkat, Ravindra Jadeja, Ishant Sharma, Saurabh Tiwary, Vinay KumarNew Zealand (From): Jamie How, Brendon McCullum(w), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Kane Williamson, Scott Styris, Grant Elliott, Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Andy McKay, Gareth Hopkins, Tim Southee, James FranklinLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
