Two slips in place and off we go...Pandey became the 12th Indian player to record a fifty on debut before falling for 71. Jadhav though continued to play aggressively after reaching his fifty and registered his maiden ODI hundred in style by hitting a maximum. His last 55 runs came off just 23 balls. Stuart Binny once again played a breezy knock and shared a quick-fire 50-run stand with Jadhav to push India past 275. The pitch isn't all that easy to bat on.

Rahane is on strike. Donald Tiripano will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Raza is the man doing all the talking in the Zimbabwe huddle. The two Indian openers are out in the middle.Teams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Chamu Chibhabha, Regis Chakabva, Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sikandar Raza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Prosper Utseya, Graeme Cremer, Neville Madziva, Donald Tiripano, Malcolm WallerIndia (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane(c), Murali Vijay, Manish Pandey, Manoj Tiwary, Robin Uthappa(w), Kedar Jadhav, Stuart Binny, Harbhajan Singh, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit SharmaRahane: 'You can't control the toss. We need to bat well and put the runs on the board. It looks pretty dry (the pitch). We need to bat well in partnerships. Manish Pandey comes in for Rayudu. Mohit Sharma comes in place of Dhawal Kulkarni.'Chigumbura: 'We will bowl first. It's an important game for us. Losing three quick wickets in the first 11 overs isn't good - we must improve. Three changes for us. Sibanda, Vitori and Williams are out. Utseya, Waller and Chakabva are in.'Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: 'Another good batting surface,' reckons Ed Rainsford. 'There's a bit of grass and should help the bowlers early on. It's a good batting surface and the team winning the toss will definitely opt to bowl first.'Having already sealed the series, this match offers India an opportunity to test their bench-strength. There will be one forced change to make at least, with Ambati Rayudu having been ruled out of the rest of the tour, with a quadricep injury. That means Manish Pandey will make his ODI debut today and he has been presented his ODI cap - by veteran spinner, Harbhajan Singh.After clinching a last-ball thriller and then registering a convincing win, India have taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the 3-match series. Can Zimbabwe bag a consolation win today and end the series on a high? Time will tell us. Hello and a warm welcome to the third ODI in Harare.Preview:After taking an unnecessarily complicated route to a win in the first ODI, India turned in a clinical performance in the second game to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series against Zimbabwe. With the series wrapped up, the third ODI gives the so-called 'fringe' Indian players, another opportunity to keep themselves in contention, the next time the national selectors convene to pick an ODI side. The middle-order remains a concern after another mini-collapse in the second game and will top the team management's agenda ahead of sterner tests to follow.Zimbabwe skipper Elton Chigumbura bemoaned his team's batting performance in the second game after they lost their top-order by the 11th over of the chase. The bowlers, led by Neville Madziva's four-fer, had done an admirable job to restrict India to 271 on a Harare surface that had eased up considerably since the Friday's first encounter. If Zimbabwe can replicate the performance from the first match, they have every reason to believe they can avoid a whitewash.Date: 14 July 2015Venue: Harare Sports Club, HarareTime: 12:30 ISTWeather: Another cold day with a maximum of 23 degree Celsius and minimum of 7 degree CelsiusTeam News:ZimbabweZimbabwe are sweating on the form of senior batsman Hamilton Masakadza. His laborious 34 in the first ODI was followed by another no-show on Sunday. Occupying the crucial No. 3 role, Masakadza, along with Sean Wiliams, will be expected to hold the middle-order together to avoid another batting collapse. Zimbabwe also lost the services of premier pacer Tinashe Panyangara to side-strain and the bowler remains unlikely to feature in the third ODI with just an extra day of rest under his belt.Probable XI: Chamu Chibhabha, Vusi Sibanda, Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura (c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Richmond Mutumbami (wk), Graeme Cremer, Neville Madziva, Donald Tiripano, Brian VitoriIndiaThe injury to in-form Ambati Rayudu opens up a slot in the middle-order for India. While the team management have summoned keeper-batsman Sanju Samson to the squad, the 20-year old is unlikely to be thrown straight into the final ODI. This, however, paves the way for Manish Pandey to make his ODI debut. The form of Robin Uthappa, Manoj Tiwary and Kedar Jadhav remains a concern and the trio will do well to put in a good performance should the opportunity arise. India also have the option of handing Sandeep Sharma, who was impressive in the recently concluded IPL, a debut. In that case either Bhuvneshwar Kumar or Dhawal Kulkarni could be rested.Probable XI: Murali Vijay, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Manish Pandey, Manoj Tiwary, Robin Uthappa (wk), Stuart Binny, Kedar Jadhav, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Sandeep Sharma/Dhawal KulkarniStats & Trivia:- Robin Uthappa needs another 97 runs to complete 1000 ODI runs. He currently has 903 from 45 matches at an average of 25.80- Zimbabwe last beat India in an ODI on June 3 2010. India have won each of the eight games since.Quotes:"The bowlers have been really up to the mark in the series and that pleases me as captain"- Ajinkya Rahane had words of praise for the bowling attack that has done well for two games in a row now."We have to work on our batting in the next game. Losing three wickets in the first 11 overs is just not good."- Elton Chigumbura identifies the batting as an area of definite improvement.Teams:India (From): Ajinkya Rahane(c), Murali Vijay, Manish Pandey, Manoj Tiwary, Robin Uthappa(w), Kedar Jadhav, Stuart Binny, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Dhawal Kulkarni, Mohit Sharma, Sandeep Sharma, Sanju SamsonZimbabwe (From): Vusi Sibanda, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Graeme Cremer, Neville Madziva, Donald Tiripano, Brian Vitori, Malcolm Waller, Regis Chakabva, Prosper Utseya, Tinashe PanyangaraLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
