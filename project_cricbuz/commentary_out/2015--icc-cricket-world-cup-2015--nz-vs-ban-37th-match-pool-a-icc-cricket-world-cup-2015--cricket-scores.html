It was Guptill and Ross Taylor, who then played with a mature head on their shoulders to help New Zealand resurrect their fortunes. Guptill also reached his fifty.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: Bangladesh opened with spinners at both ends. However, Martin Guptill looked to take on the spinners by showcasing good footwork and using the crease to play a volley of fine shots. Brendon McCullum, Guptill's opening partner, has been in spectacular form in this World Cup. But he tried to play one shot too many and was dismissed by Shakib Al Hasan. Shakib followed it up by taking the wicket of the fulcrum of New Zealand's batting line-up, Kane Williamson. It was a good strategy to bowl spin at McCullum as New Zealand's skipper likes pace on the ball. That will be the first drinks break.

And surprise, surprise, it is Shakib to open the attack for Bangladesh. Guptill will take strike first up. The countdown starts and we are all set to get things underway. So, here we go...Welcome back.. Bangladesh have not lost to New Zealand in their last 8 games. The Kiwi middle-order has not been tested in the tournament. So, the match is set-up nicely at the moment. And here is a stat that would give the Bangladeshi supporters hope. Rubel Hossain has bowled 10 deliveries to McCullum in ODIs and has got him out thrice, conceding only 7 runs.The track is expected to get slower as the match progresses and the target may prove to be a tricky one to chase down. However, Bangladesh need to be wary of McCullum, as he has been in excellent form in this World Cup.The veteran left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori also made an impression with subtle variations of pace to keep the opposition in check in the middle overs. However, McClenaghan, who replaced the injured Adam Milne had a poor day. New Zealand also would rue the fact that Corey Anderson dropped a chance in the slip cordon to give Mahmudullah a reprieve when he was on one. On his part, Brendon McCullum backed up the pacers and gave them aggressive fields.From Bangladesh's perspective, one has to remember that Soumya Sarkar counterattacked to lift their sagging morale after they lost wickets up front. He looked to free his arms outside the off-stump and whenever the pacers bowled short and wide, he clobbered it for boundaries square of the wicket on either side. Earlier, it was Boult and Tim Southee, who swung the new ball and extracted movement off the deck on a helpful track to create problems for the openers. Boult then, produced a superb delivery that shaped into the left-handed Imrul Kayes before it moved off the track to uproot the stumps. Boult also sent Tamim Iqbal back to the pavilion.Mahmudullah also showed that he is a street-smart cricketer as when Mitchell McClenaghan came into the attack, he waited for him to bowl a fuller length and played a lofted shot over mid-on in the 25th over. In the slog overs, he showed his class by clouting McClenaghan for a six and followed it up by smashing the same bowler for three more fours in the 47th over. Even Sabbir Rahman gave a good account of himself by thwacking a few eye-catching strokes during the end overs. He thrashed the wayward McClenaghan for a four and a six in the 45th over.Mahmudullah yet again shored up Bangladesh's innings by compiling his second ton in successive matches to take them to a sizeable total on the board. He only became the second cricketer from Bangladesh to compose back-to-back hundreds in ODIs. After surviving a few nervous moments against the new ball, Mahmudullah, shone brightly by essaying drives and lofted shots. It was in the 14th over of the innings, when he looked to break the shackles by collecting three boundaries off Trent Boult.Mahmudullah is being congratulated by the BlackCaps. The whole of Seddon Park is on their feet applauding the effort from the Bangladeshi. Even when he got to his ton, McCullum and a couple of others clapped. Good sportsmanship shown. They know what a high-quality innings this has been. Also they know that they are in for a fight, perhaps for the first time in this World Cup. Remember they haven't chased over 200 in this World Cup.4

BANGLADESH:49.4 Elliott to Nasir Hossain, SIX, McCullum running back from mid-off doesn't do anything fancy this time, watches the ball goes over his head and sees it land beyond the boundary, when Hossain hit it, it looked like it went straight up in the air, but he has hit the slice well and another six in the last over of the innings

The healthy Bangladeshi crowd like it too.
BANGLADESH:46.3 McClenaghan to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, 100 for Mahmudullah! Mahmudullah emulates Shahriar Nafees as he becomes the second Bangladeshi to get back-to-back tons in ODIs. Mahmudullah has done it in a World Cup. Against England and New Zealand. That makes it special. He can rightly take a bow. Two high quality innings, when the conditions were tough and against the likes of Anderson, Broad, Southee and Boult with the ball hooping around corners. Shows what a highly skilled player he is. Also technically so good too.
BANGLADESH:46.2 McClenaghan to S Rahman, 1 run, now Southee at long-off looks to get under that catch from Rahman.

Not very convincing, but he will take it, comes down the track and looks to heave over leg, gets a thick outside edge that evades a leaping Ronchi to his leftBatting powerplay taken by BangladeshMitchell McClenaghan generally looked to bowl back of a length, but when he bowled a fuller length, Mahmudullah and Sarkar collected boundaries. Both Sarkar and Mahmudullah also amassed fifties. Unfortunately for Bangladesh, Sarkar threw his wicket away after composing a fine half-century by getting out to Vettori. The wicket is expected to get slower as the day progresses and Bangladesh look set to post a good total on the board.Soumya Sarkar and Mahmudullah continued to frustrate New Zealand's pace bowlers. Brendon McCullum introduced Daniel Vettori into the attack and he bowled a few tight overs. The credit has to go to Sarkar and Mahmudullah for looking to counterattack when up against quality pacers and then rotating the strike to keep the scorecard moving. Drinks time and it's time for Bharath to get going

BANGLADESH:16.1 Vettori to Mahmudullah, 1 run, shortish on the stumps, punched off the back foot to long-onIt was Boult, who was duly rewarded for his efforts with the wicket of Kayes. He got the ball to shape it back into the left-handed batsman before it moved away off the track to shatter the stumps. Boult followed it up by sending Tamim back to the pavilion. Tamim has a habit of playing with an angled bat and he paid the price for it. Bangladesh could collect their first runs off Boult's bowling only in his fourth over. It could have been even better for New Zealand, but Corey Anderson dropped a catch in the slip cordon to give Mahmudullah a reprieve off Southee. In the last game against England, Mahmudullah survived a testing spell from James Anderson upfront, but he had his fair share of luck with a few inside edges and he was reluctant to come forward. Today too he is camping on the back foot. For Bangladesh, Soumya Sarkar looked to take on the challenge of facing up to a quality attack and succeeded by essaying a quick-fire knock. In fact, it was his partnership with Mahmudullah that helped Bangladesh to recover.Southee also has a useful short delivery up his sleeve and he used it to trouble Kayes. Another factor to look at is that Southee bowls this scrambled seam delivery which he uses it as a variation. It was back in 2012 in a Test match in Bangalore when he used it extensively for the first time to take wickets and Sachin Tendulkar was one of the batsmen, who lost his wicket to Southee's variation.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 16 overs: Trent Boult and Tim Southee swung the new ball and also extracted a bit of movement off the deck to trouble Bangladesh's openers. Boult swung it away from the left-handed batsmen. On the other hand, Southee looked to bowl full and shape it back into the openers, with the odd delivery leaving Imrul Kayes and Tamim Iqbal. He even bowled a cracker of a yorker to Tamim. New Zealand's pace duo of Southee and Boult generally bowled a fuller length with the new ball and Brendon McCullum backed them up by setting aggressive fields. Drinks are on the field now. The more I see that dive from McCullum in the last over, the more I'm convinced, that it was totally unnecessary. He so easily could've done serious harm to himself, either to his hand or to his head/neck while colliding with the ad-board. But that also shows how committed Baz is, not worrying about himself at all. The whole of New Zealand heaved a sigh of relief when McCullum got up unscathed there. New Zealand don't want to lose their talismanic skipper at this stage of the World Cup. They lost Martin Crowe during the second innings of their semi-final loss to Pakistan. They wouldn't want history to repeat again.

Let's find out how they handle the pacers up frontPitch report by Scott Styris: It has been under cover for the last 24 hours. It could aid Southee, Boult and Vettori. Whoever wins the toss, will look to bowl first.Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan(c), Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Taijul Islam, Rubel Hossain, Taskin AhmedNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent BoultNew Zealand have won the toss and have opted to fieldMcCullum: "The first week was quite intense for us. We had three games in seven days. Just had a break which has helped us recover from injuries that we've had. We have a fully fit team pretty much to pick from today, barring one. Looking forward to today's game. We are going to have a bowl first. Just seen with the cloud cover, obviously yesterday under covers all day, can tend to swing here as well and the pitch just looks a little bit soft on top and with the day-nighter, it can skid on here later on. They were pretty keen to get first use of the ball (talking about Boult and Southee). They have got a lot of experience at this ground. We have got some fond memories here as well. Hopefully we can turn up today, perform as strongly as we have done in the tournament so far and if we do that, we will give ourselves a good chance in this game. We have got one change, it wasn't through illness - Adam Milne after that great catch he took the other day, has jarred his shoulder and Mitch McClenaghan comes in for him. Otherwise, everyone else is good to go. They are a very good side, who are improving every time they come into big tournaments. They have the wood over us when it comes to playing games over in their conditions. Today is an opportunity for us to be able to try and I guess, rectify that record that currently sits. Very respectful of the players that they have got and obviously will be well led by Shakib as well and it will be a good challenge for us."Shakib: "He has got a little bit of a niggle. We don't want to take a risk on him ahead of the quarter-final (talking about Mortaza). He is just having a rest. We would've bowled first as well. Looks to me a good track although a bit of overcast conditions and that will help the bowlers I think. But if we get through the first hour or so, I think it will be a very good track to bat on. We do know that (on beating New Zealand), but it will be obviously difficult for us, but if we play to our potential, anything is possible in ODI games - that's the beauty of this game. There are two changes - in place of Arafat Sunny, Taijul Islam came in and in place of Mashrafe Mortaza, Nasir Hossain came in"News coming in is that Mortaza isn't playing this game. Shakib will be the captain. We will confirm that for you at the tossTeam News: Adam Milne injured his shoulder while trying to take a catch in the previous game against Afghanistan, he has not recovered in time. Hence, New Zealand might play Mitchell McClenaghan. As for Bangladesh, on a slow Hamilton wicket, they might be tempted to play an extra spinner. Stay tuned as the teams and toss are coming up in a short while...Weather Check: It has been raining since the last two days in Hamilton. But, the weather looks alright today and we should have a full game. It will be cloudy in the evening, but nothing to worry us.BangladeshBangladesh started with a win over Afghanistan. That game was almost like a payback encounter as they had lost to the Asian minnows in the Asia Cup. Their game against Australia was washed out and they were completely outplayed by Sri Lanka. But, they rose to the challenge the Scottish provided them with and chased down the second highest target in World Cups successfully. Nonetheless, their best game was versus England. Even though they were two down for next to nothing, the batsmen put their hands up and took them to a decent total of 275. Then, an inspired Mashrafe Mortaza led the team from the front to win the game by 15 runs.Surprisingly, it is the Bangladeshi pacers who have done most of the damage in this World Cup. The trio of Mortaza, Rubel and Taskin have bowled well together. With Shakib backing them up, it looks a very good attack. Mahmudullah and Rahim have been in terrific form with the bat and the likes of Tamim and Shakib chipping in, it looks like a well settled unit. However, their problems has been the 5th bowler, Mahmudullah and Sabbir Rahman have tried to fill in but without much success. So, this will give them a chance to know their best XI before the knockouts begin.New ZealandThe Black Caps have kept their favorites tag intact. Starting with a massive win over Sri Lanka, getting through Scotland, annihilating England, prevailing over arch-rivals Australia and thumping Afghanistan. They have been the form side and one of the only two sides to have remained unbeaten in the tournament, the other being India. Their last game against Afghanistan was a walk in the park, Daniel Vettori ran through the middle order after Boult had given an opening. McCullum got them off to a blistering start, before Taylor and Anderson finised it off with ease.Boult, Southee and Vettori are amongst the top 5 wicket-takers in the World Cup. New Zealand owe their success to those three. They have bowled out opposition for less than 200 in 4 out of 5 games. However, McCullum will be aware that his middle-order has not been tested. The likes of Taylor, Elliott and Ronchi have not spent much time in the middle. So, this game provides the batters an ideal opportunity to have a proper hit.Now, we shall have quick glance regarding the form guide of both the teams..The two sides met towards the end of 2013 in a bilateral series in Bangladesh. New Zealand headed into the 3-matches series after drawing the Test series 0-0. And it was the Bangladesh who had the better off the Kiwis, beating them 3-0. They also have a stranglehold on the Black Caps in the last 8 games, winning 7 and the other being abandoned. However, all those games were played in Bangladesh and when it comes to World Cups, New Zealand have a 3-0 lead over them. Even Brendon McCullum acknowledged the fact that they were beaten away from home and in unfamiliar conditions. This is what the Kiwi captain had to say before the game, 'I don't know about payback time. Their performances against us were over in their conditions.'11:45 Local Time, 23:45 GMT, 05:15 IST: Drama, emotions, joy, disappointment and what not were seen when Bangladesh beat England on Monday at Adelaide. It was for the first time that the Asian team qualified for the knockouts. And they did it in style, beating a lackluster England, who have been shown the door in the World Cup. However, today Bangladesh are up against the favorites, New Zealand and it is not going to be easy. Before we go further, let's have a look as to what happened when these two teams last met.Preview:During the 1992 World Cup, also held Down Under, New Zealand went on a seven game unbeaten streak before losing the final pool encounter against Pakistan and then losing again to Imran Khan's 'Cornered Tigers' in the semi-finals to bow out. There's a lesson for Brendon McCullum's men from Martin Crowe's side - Momentum is everything. Come Friday, at the Seddon Park in Hamilton, they'll take on a buoyant Bangladesh side fresh after their giant slaying act in Adelaide. While the Black Caps are assured of a top of the table finish irrespective of the outcome, there's enough in the encounter to keep Bangladesh interested. A win would take them above Sri Lanka in Pool A and help them avoid the other dominant team in the quarters - India. Bangladesh will also have happy memories of playing New Zealand when they swept the bilateral ODI 3-0 the last time New Zealand toured Bangladesh in late 2013.Team NewsNew Zealand:Since the start of the tournament on February 14th, New Zealand have looked every-bit their annoited tag of 'favourites'. Brendon McCullum's aggressive captaincy and top-order batting has lit up the tournament. The bowling led by Tim Southee and Trent Boult has blown opposition away for totals less than 200 in four out of their five games. Daniel Vettori has shown that his left-arm spinners remain relevant even in the modern era of power hitting. If there's an area of concern for New Zealand, it's the middle-order. Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott and Luke Ronchi have less than 100 runs from the 5 games and are yet to be tested. New Zealand will be hopeful of the trio getting warmed up to the challenges that lie ahead in the knockout phase. An illness broke out in the camp in the last week but McCullum assured in his pre-match press conference that the players have recovered sufficiently. However, Adam Milne, who injured his shoulder while diving to take a catch against Afghanistan, is still sore and is likely to be replaced by left-arm pacer Mitchell McClenaghan.Probable XI:Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum (c), Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi (wk), Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne/Mitchell McClenaghan, Tim Southee, Trent BoultPlayer to watch out for: Ross Taylor - Taylor occupies the crucial No. 4 spot for New Zealand and a batting average of 17.66 with a best of 24* in 5 games hardly does justice to his talent and batting order. New Zealand will hope for a strong showing from their senior batsman to boost the middle-order.Bangladesh:'The Tigers' are fresh from their victory over England that effectively dumped Eoin Morgan's men out of the World Cup. In New Zealand, they will be up against a significantly better side but that should not stop them from believing a positive result can be achieved. Captain Mashrafe Mortaza, who's had issues with his knee is also down with a sore throat and maybe rested in a bid to keep him ready for the all-important quarter-final. Mortaza also has an over-rate fine hanging over his head and a rest would allay any fears of the skipper missing out the quarters due to a second breach. Bangladesh could consider playing the extra spinner in Taijul Islam on a Seddon Park surface known to favour the spinners.Probable XI:Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Sabbir Rahman, Mashrafe Mortaza (capt), Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Taskin AhmedPlayer to watch out for: Tamim Iqbal - The experienced Bangladesh opener has 116 runs in four innings so far, 95 of which came in one game against Scotland. Bangladesh's middle-order has not received a significant platform from their openers and a strong showing from Tamim will go a long way to remedy that.Pitch and Conditions:Hamilton has received a lot of rainfall in the last two days and there remains every chance that the match might get called off. However, the forecast for Friday is better and a full game might get underway. The Seddon Park in Hamilton is generally known to keep the slower bowlers interested as indicated by MS Dhoni's use of R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Suresh Raina in the last game played there. However the short square boundaries ensure that there is no shortage of runs. Batting is known to get easier in the evening under lights and with DLS coming into picture, teams would prefer chasing.Quotes:"He (Brendon McCullum) is one of the key players we need to get out early. He's playing without fear. But, again, we have a few game plans. " ourselves.- Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha on the keys to doing well against New Zealand."I don't know about payback time.
