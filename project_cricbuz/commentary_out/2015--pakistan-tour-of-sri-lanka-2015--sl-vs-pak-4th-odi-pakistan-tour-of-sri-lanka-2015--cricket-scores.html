For Sri Lanka, the slinga Malinga will open the proceedings, he has two slips in place.. here we go then...The Pakistani bowling was disciplined. Irfan started it by picking a wicket off the second ball of the match. Imad Wasim continued to impress and Yasir Shah kept it tight. The fielding too has improved leaps and bounds as they took some terrific catches. They should fancy their chances as they have scored more than 250 in all the three previous ODIs. Join us back for the run-chase...Sri Lanka would be disappointed with the final score. Once again the hosts' batters failed to make the most of good batting conditions. Only two fifties in the entire innings and had it not been for the 109-run 2nd wicket stand, the final score would have been much less. After losing Perera in the first over, Dilshan and Thirimanne steadied the innings. Both got to fifties and it was the latter who carried on and almost notched up a ton, before falling 10 short. Cameos from Chandimal, Siriwardana and Malinga ensured that Sri Lanka reached a competitive total.4

K Perera is on strike. Irfan will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Mohammad Irfan will begin the proceedings for Pakistan, he has two slips in place. Kusal Perera to face the music under overcast conditions. We're all set to begin, let's roll....Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kusal Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal(w), Ashan Priyanjan, Milinda Siriwardana, Sachith Pathirana, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga LakmalPakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Azhar Ali(c), Mohammad Hafeez, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Imad Wasim, Anwar Ali, Yasir Shah, Rahat Ali, Mohammad IrfanAzhar Ali: 'We are pretty much ready, we will look to restrict them to a low total. We are playing an unchanged team. Need to keep the plans simple and play well. Everyone are performing well, today is another chance to do well.'Mathews: 'We will bat first. Couple of changes. Thisara Perera and Upul Tharanga are out, they are replaced by Ashan Priyanjan and Suranga Lakmal . It looks dry, might take some turn later on, we need to play well.'Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: 'It looks a lot more drier and there are more cracks on it, it's very hard and bare. Win the toss and bat first,' reckons Dean JonesTheir bowling department have let them down very badly with strike bowler Malinga struggling to find his form. All-rounder Thisara Perera is yet to provide anything substantial for his team in this series. Pakistan have nothing to ponder about with everyone in the team contributing, as and when needed. The tourists would most likely go with an unchanged combination. However, the hosts would certainly make a few changes in their bowling wing and it would be interesting to see if they tinker too much with their combination from their last game. The toss and teams are on the way. Do stay tuned.....A do-or-die encounter awaits Sri Lanka while Pakistan are one win away from sealing the series. A win in this match will also help Pakistan ease closer to qualifying for the Champions Trophy. Hello and a very warm welcome to our coverage of the 4th ODI between Sri Lanka and Pakistan. An all-round effort helped the visitors clinch a 135-run win against the home team in the previous game. The Sri Lankan bowlers have barely troubled the opposition while their batsmen failed to apply themselves in crunch situations. Sri Lanka have already lost the Test series, an ODI series loss will only hurt them more.Preview:Pakistan's quest for Champions Trophy qualification received a significant boost on Sunday when they secured a crushing 135 run win in the third ODI against Sri Lanka to take a 2-1 series lead. They need to complete a 4-1 win to eclipse West Indies in the ODI rankings but a return to the R. Premadasa Stadium for the fourth game, gives Pakistan, a chance to complete a significant series win. A win will not only put Pakistan a step closer to assuring their presence in the eight-team ICC event but also help complete a rare Test and ODI double over Sri Lanka.A series win in Sri Lanka will also vindicate the selectors' decision to persist with a largely young ODI side following the high-profile retirement of Shahid Afridi and Misbah-ul-Haq and the subsequent series loss to Bangladesh. The performance of youngsters bodes well for the team's future, at least in the 50-over format.The same, though, cannot be said about Sri Lanka. The absence of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene has severely crippled the islanders' middle-order. While the middle-order has misfired with uncanny regularity, the batting forms only half of Sri Lanka's woes. The decision to bowl with as many as four all-rounders and only two specialists is severely denting their chances of restricting opposition on batting surfaces such as the one at the Premadasa. Sri Lanka need individuals to step up if they are to avoid another ODI series defeat.Date: July 22, 2015Venue: R. Premadasa Stadium, ColomboTime: 14:30 ISTWeather: Mostly Cloudy. Thunderstorms forecast for the evening.Team News:Sri LankaThisara Perera's sequence of failures continued in the 3rd ODI with the all-rounder contributing just 12 runs with the bat after conceding 63 runs from his quota of overs. Perera, however, has skipper Angelo Mathews' confidence and could see himself get another opportunity. With Lasith Malinga not the force he once was, the think-tank could consider fielding another specialist bowler and bring in either Suranga Lakmal, Seekkuge Prasanna or Sachithra Senanayake. The hosts have also been over-reliant on Kusal Perera and Dilshan to fire and need the middle-order of Tharanga, Mathews and Chandimal to prevent the repeated batting collapses.Probable XI: Kusal Perera, TM Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Upul Tharanga, Angelo Mathews (c), Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Thisara Perera, Sachith Pathirana, Milinda Siriwardana/Seekugge Prasanna, Nuwan Pradeep, Lasith MalingaPakistanPakistan are expected to go into the game unchanged barring forced changes due to injuries. The ploy to bring in Imad Wasim for Babar Azam to compensate for the loss of Mohammad Hafeez, the bowler, in the third ODI was a tactical master-stroke. The pitch at the Premadasa, despite being good to bat on, should favour spin once again and Pakistan remain well off in that department. The likes of Shehzad, Azhar Ali, Sarfraz and Rizwan provide exciting batting options for the visitors.Probable XI: Ahmed Shehzad, Azhar Ali (c), Mohammad Hafeez, Sarfraz Ahmed (wk), Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Imad Wasim, Anwar Ali, Yasir Shah, Rahat Ali, Mohammad Irfan Stats and Trivia:- Despite the furore surrounding his bowling ban, Mohammad Hafeez has not let it affect his batting. He tops the charts with 166 runs at 55.33- The third game saw the first instance of each of Pakistan's Top-6 batsman to score 35 or more runs in an ODI.Quotes:"We need to beat them in the next game to stay alive in the series, but we can't make too many changes either"- Angelo Mathews said that the defeat in the third ODI would not force drastic changes in the team composition."Sarfraz can bat at number 4. When he plays his natural game, he can be really destructive"- Azhar Ali on the decision to promote Sarfraz Ahmed up the batting order.Teams:Pakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Azhar Ali(c), Mohammad Hafeez, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Anwar Ali, Imad Wasim, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Irfan, Rahat Ali, Bilal Asif, Ehsan Adil, Mukhtar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Asad ShafiqSri Lanka (From): Kusal Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Upul Tharanga, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal(w), Sachith Pathirana, Thisara Perera, Milinda Siriwardana, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Pradeep, Ashan Priyanjan, Seekkuge Prasanna, Suranga Lakmal, Sachithra SenanayakeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
