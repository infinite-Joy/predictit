INDIA:49.5 Rabada to Binny, out Caught by Amla!! Two in two for Rabada and he's on a hat-trick. What an over under pressure from the young man.

INDIA:48.6 Steyn to Dhoni, 1 run, oh that's a good stop. This could be a very crucial moment in the game. Short and wide outside off stump, Dhoni cuts well, but Phangiso dived to his left and got a hand on it, there was no one in the deep and he has saved three runs
INDIA:48.5 Steyn to Dhoni, 2 runs, Dhoni advances, Steyn fires it wide outside off stump, Dhoni reaches out and slaps it to sweeper cover, easy two
INDIA:48.4 Steyn to Dhoni, FOUR, what? An innovative little shot from Dhoni? This is a rare sight folks! Full and on the off stump, Dhoni moves right across the stumps and just helps it fine with a paddle and beats the man at short fine leg. Maybe because of the fact that he's tired, he wants to make use of the pace on the ball from the bowler and not go down the ground as he would have had to generate a lot of power
INDIA:48.3 Steyn to Binny, 1 run, full and in the slot, but Binny only manages to drive it down to long-on

This is a crucial over. Steyn will bowl the penultimate over. Dhoni takes some water, takes a bit of time, he's clutching his side a bit, but he's good to carry on.
INDIA:47.6 Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run, Dhoni wants the strike, short of length delivery on the leg stump, gently nudged to mid-wicket
INDIA:47.5 Rabada to Binny, leg byes, 1 run, short of length delivery on the leg stump, Binny misses out of the glance, the ball rolls off the thigh pad to backward square leg. A fine little tickle would have been more runs
INDIA:47.4 Rabada to Dhoni, 1 run, slower delivery outside off stump, Dhoni dabs it to short third man
INDIA:47.3 Rabada to Dhoni, 2 runs, once again Dhoni shouts "two, two, two." He's off like a rocket. What running this is from the Indian captain. On seeing Dhoni advance, Rabada drags the slower ball back, Dhoni slaps it to deep point and gets back for the second
INDIA:47.2 Rabada to Dhoni, 2 runs, sensible from Dhoni, just tucks this softly into the vacant mid-wicket region, calls for two and races back for the second
INDIA:47.1 Rabada to Dhoni, 2 runs, sloppy fielding from Morne and Dhoni gets an extra run.

INDIA:46.5 Tahir to Raina, out Caught by Duminy!! This is such an inspirational over from the leggie! Two wickets and just 4 runs off it, with one more ball to go. Clever bowling from Tahir. He knows that Raina loves to go over mid-wicket, bowls a googly and bowls it wide of off stump, Raina had to fetch the slog-sweep and he only managed to slice it high in the air, long-on settled under it and took it cleanly. Raina c Duminy b Tahir 3(3)Tahir to Raina, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

INDIA:46.1 Tahir to Rohit, out Caught&Bowled!! Oh dear! What a soft dismissal. Rohit Sharma can't believe what he's done. He throws his head back in disappointment, meanwhile, Tahir takes off on a celebratory run. Mind you, South Africa are still in it. Flighted delivery outside off stump, Rohit advances but doesn't get to the pitch of the ball, he was only looking to drive it along the ground to long-off for a run, but checked his shot and hit it straight back to the bowler. Rohit gets a standing ovation and a few South African players congratulate him for his wonderful knock as he walks back. Rohit c and b Tahir 150(133) [4s-13 6s-6]Tahir to Rohit, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!Imran Tahir [9.0-0-53-0] is back into the attackThe equation is now down to 35 runs off 24 balls. South Africa need wickets and need them very quickly.

INDIA:45.5 Steyn to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit is late to take off, but he completes the run and this is the third time that Rohit Sharma has reached 150 in ODIs. Length delivery outside off stump, Rohit punches it towards cover, for some reason Rohit hesitated but he had enough time to take off again and get to the other end. He raises his bat to the crowd, Dhoni pats him on the back. It has been an exceptional knock
INDIA:45.4 Steyn to Dhoni, 1 run, very full, not quite a yorker, Dhoni drills it to long-on
INDIA:45.3 Steyn to Rohit, 1 run, length delivery from Steyn, Rohit nudges it to mid-wicket
INDIA:45.2 Steyn to Rohit, SIX, wooowwww! Just wow! What a shot sir and that too against a top bowler. Shortish and on the leg stump, Rohit gets inside the line and plays the pick up shot, there was a man at deep backward square leg but he was a mere spectator
INDIA:45.1 Steyn to Rohit, 2 runs, ohhh! David Miller almost makes a mess of it in the deep.

INDIA:44.1 M Morkel to Rohit, SIX, in the airrrrr, fielder tries to get there but it's gone all the way. Length delivery on the off stump, Rohit moves across and plays a lovely looking flick shot, the timing was so good that it went for six. Rabada tried to run to his right from deep mid-wicket and get to the ball, he initially misjudged it as he ran forward, then went back and dived full length but it escaped. Kohli is relieved to see the ball go past the fielder. In fact, had he been on the edge of the rope, he could have taken the catch
INDIA:43.6 Rabada to Dhoni, no run, fullish and outside off stump, Dhoni slashes and misses, the ball sneaks under Dhoni's bat

INDIA:42.4 M Morkel to Dhoni, 1 run, absolute comedy of errors! Biggggg mix-up, South Africa had two chances to run Rohit out but they've made a mess of it. Short of a length delivery just outside off stump, Dhoni pushes it towards cover-point and sets off, Rohit says, "no, no, no," yet the Indian captain marches forward almost suggesting that I am the captain, you've got to obey my orders, Rohit then responds, Phangiso was the fielder and he threw it to the striker's end, he missed the direct-hit, but QdK ran forward and collected the throw, it wasn't accurate and he was already past the stumps. He tried to flick it back onto the sticks but he missed as well. Great escape for Rohit
INDIA:42.3 M Morkel to Rohit, 1 run, risky shot but Rohit gets away with it. Fine leg wasn't inside the ring, so I think this is a risky shot for just one run. Fullish and on the off stump, Rohit gets across and slightly bends his knees before playing a wristy flick
INDIA:42.2 M Morkel to Dhoni, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Dhoni goes back and pushes it to coverMorne aborts his run-up, not for the first time today.

INDIA:39.6 Steyn to Kohli, out Caught by M Morkel!! Did that carry to the fielder? Kohli is walking after Morne gave him the thumbs up, he doesn't need a replay. The crowd goes silent. Now Kohli waits near the boundary for the confirmation and the third umpire is happy that it was a clean catch. Steyn himself couldn't believe that he's got a wicket with this ball. It was full and way down the leg-side, followed Kohli a bit as he made room, the batsman flicked, with fine leg inside the ring, he could have placed it anywhere and picked up four, instead he picks him out and the Giraffe takes a very good low catch diving forward. Morne's long reach helped him there as he grabbed it inches from the ground. Is this the opening the Proteas needed to tighten the screws? Kohli c M Morkel b Steyn 11(18)Steyn to Kohli, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:39.5 Steyn to Kohli, 2 runs, 'two, two, two,' is the call from Kohli as soon he nudged this length ball into the vacant mid-wicket region, before the fielder could rush in and fire the throw, Rohit made his ground

INDIA:38.1 Tahir to Rohit, 1 run, that was a great stop by Behardien. Flighted delivery on the leg stump, Rohit flicks uppishly past mid-wicket, the fielder at long-on runs to his right, tumbles and saves three, surprising that the batsmen just ran one run on that occasionWe are all set for cracking finish. India need 98 runs off 72 balls. The ball is reversing and Steyn will be crucial. Meanwhile, Steyn is getting some attention on the sidelines.

INDIA:37.4 Steyn to Kohli, no run, lovely looking front foot drive from Kohli, but it hits Steyn on the leg in his followthrough. I hope he's alright. Did that miss the boot? Oh yes indeed!

INDIA:36.5 Tahir to Rohit, 1 run, flighted delivery outside off stump, Rohit drives it to long-off
INDIA:36.4 Tahir to Rohit, no run, how did that miss the stumps? Gee! That ball just flew over middle and off. Rohit was on the front foot to work it into the on-side, is beaten on the outside edge and the extra bounce saved him on that occasion
INDIA:36.3 Tahir to Rohit, no run, quicker delivery just outside off stump, should have been put away as there was no protection in the deep, Rohit goes for the cut and gets beaten

Fullish and on the stumps, Rohit flicks it over the infield, the man at long-on runs and dives to his right, but fails to stop the ball. Rohit takes the helmet off, raises his arms in joy, shows the bat to the dressing room and the crowd to acknowledge the applause

INDIA:34.3 M Morkel to Rohit, no run, slower fuller ball from Morkel. This is what Kanpur does to you, big sturdy Morkel is forced to bowl a slower ball. Rohit is nicely forward in defence
INDIA:34.2 M Morkel to Rohit, no run, this one is through Rohit. Length delivery veered back sharply from outside off, Rohit's bat comes down at an angle in trying to push through the off-side, to be fair to him he would have played for the straight ball. Beaten on the inside edge

INDIA:33.4 Behardien to Rahane, out Caught by D Miller!! South Africa finally get the breakthrough. Didn't they need it badly? Finding the fielders on the last two balls made Rahane twitchy. He goes leg-side trying to launch the inside out drive over extra-cover, Behardien smartly follows him with a length delivery cramping him for room just enough so that he couldn't get the desired elevation. Ends up chipping it straight to Miller at extra-cover who accepts it with a reverse-cup. Rahane c D Miller b Behardien 60(82) [4s-5]Behardien to Rahane, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Rohit was scrambling back after backing up.
INDIA:32.1 M Morkel to Rahane, no run, back of a length delivery just outside off, Rahane punches it nicely but cannot get it past backward pointDrinks are on the field now! With his place continuously talked about, at times needlessly, Rahane comes up with the perfect answer. He has acted as the perfect foil for Rohit. And that brings me to Rohit. Well, what can you say? Just ease back into the couch, in my case a chair, and watch him bat. Can sit here all day to be honest. India are on course but should guard against complacency.
INDIA:31.6 Behardien to Rahane, 1 run, slightly fuller again on the stumps, wristed down to long-on
INDIA:31.5 Behardien to Rahane, no run, in the blockhole on middle, gentle pace though. Rahane easily digs it out

The sweeper cover gives chase and puts in a futile diveFarhaan Behardien [3.0-0-22-0] is back into the attack

INDIA:30.5 M Morkel to Rohit, no run, angling into the pads, Rohit gently flicks to mid-wicket
INDIA:30.4 M Morkel to Rahane, 1 run, beats the diving cover fielder but cannot beat mid-off. Rahane is looking to be a bit more free after the landmark. Not full enough to be driving, but he goes through on the rise, and how! Imperious batting
INDIA:30.3 M Morkel to Rohit, 1 run, slightly back of a length delivery around off, Rohit waits on the crease and dabs down to third man
INDIA:30.2 M Morkel to Rahane, 1 run, Rahane is done in by the dual nature of the pitch. Luckily, the ball is between two fielders. Holds up in the pitch on a length, Rahane is forced to check his punch but cannot keep it along the ground through the covers

INDIA:29.6 Tahir to Rohit, SIX, this is even better. Clears the ropes. The world seems such a better place with Rohit in full flow. Way to go, Sir! This was the conventional leg-break, very full again. He clears his front leg and uses more of the bottom hand for leverage
INDIA:29.5 Tahir to Rohit, FOUR, the googly and Rohit picks it, was very full which made the job easier. Creams the inside-out drive over extra
INDIA:29.4 Tahir to Rahane, 1 run, 11th ODI fifty for Rahane! He points his bat at the dressing room as if to make a point. Coming to the ball, it was fullish on the stumps, Rahane wrists it wide of mid-wicket

INDIA:28.5 Duminy to Rohit, 2 runs, overcompensates and drags it short outside off, Rohit cuts square of the wicket

INDIA:28.3 Duminy to Rahane, 1 run, pushed through the air outside off, no spin. Slightly short as well, Rahane doesn't go for the fierce cut, goes for the gentle version of it with the intention of rotating strike. Gets the single to sweeper cover
INDIA:28.2 Duminy to Rohit, 1 run, flatter on the pads from round the wicket, Rohit eases into the push down to long-on
INDIA:28.1 Duminy to Rahane, 1 run, flattish trajectory on this delivery which turns back in from outside off, Rahane goes leg side and cuts it through the cover region. Was cramped for room by the spin and so didn't quite time it well enoughJean-Paul Duminy [3.0-0-24-0] is back into the attack

Rohit is on strike. Steyn will open the attackSteyn opens the bowling for RSA. Two slips in place..Welcome back.. 53 runs from the last 3 overs and suddenly India are chasing a 300+ score. How will the Indian batsmen respond?A big challenge for India. This will be a record chase at this venue if they pull it off. Interestingly, they have this stat to lift the mood in the dressing room - 4 out of 5 games here have been won by the team batting second. Take a short break and join us back at 13:00 local time for India's reply.AB de Villiers made the most of a few loose deliveries, while Behardien also played a breezy cameo to propel the visitors past 300. Amit Mishra was the pick of the bowlers for India and picked up two important wickets. Umesh Yadav too bagged two, but was expensive towards the end. Generally, the mid-innings break in ODIs is 45 minutes long, but it will be only 30 minutes for this game as the light fades quickly at Kanpur in the evening.Openers Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock got the side off to a good start. Faf du Plessis played a handy knock and registered a fifty, but it was AB de Villiers, who held the innings together. Ravichandran Ashwin was bowling very well to the South African captain in particular, but he had to go off the field after bowling just 22 balls into his quota of 10 overs. That was a huge blow for India as they lost their premier bowler. He returned to the field after a while, but went back again after bowling one more over. The fast bowlers couldn't do the job towards the end and leaked too many runs.AB de Villiers: "The Indian public is way too good for me and I love coming here. We would now love to have a good innings with the ball in hand. The wicket was hard for the first 90 odd runs, I worked really hard initially. I thought Hash (Amla) and Quinny (de Kock) batted well up front. It will be nice to see Dale (Steyn) and Morne (Morkel) running in again, hopefully we can take a few early wickets and put them under pressure."South Africa have now recorded the highest team total ever at this venue. They scored 109 runs in the last 10 overs and 65 of them came in the last 5 overs. India's problem with the death-bowling continues. AB de Villiers took 54 balls to score his first 50 runs, but he needed just 19 more to score his next 53 runs4
SOUTH AFRICA:49.6 U Yadav to de Villiers, SIX, in the airrrrr and that's just over the bar again. 21st ODI hundred for AB de Villiers. What applause from the crowd, a standing ovation. This is great to see especially after what happened at Cuttack. ABdV is getting a reception an Indian player would get. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, de Villiers flat bats the pull and clears the man at long-on. Excellent innings from the South African captain and he's led from the front. He takes the helmet off, raises his bat and acknowledges the applause
SOUTH AFRICA:49.5 U Yadav to de Villiers, no run, oh dear! Would you believe it? ABdV misses out on a length ball, it was in the slot but the late inswing beats the bat
SOUTH AFRICA:49.4 U Yadav to Behardien, 1 run, yorker on the stumps, dug out to cover, big roar from the crowd as they know that ABdV, who is now on 98, will get the strike backRound the wicket now.
SOUTH AFRICA:49.3 U Yadav to Behardien, SIX, slower delivery, picked early, Behardien delays the lofted drive, times it very well and even a jump from Dhawan wasn't good enough as it cleared the long-off boundary
SOUTH AFRICA:49.2 U Yadav to Behardien, FOUR, this is a great finish from South Africa. Yadav misses the yorker and bowls a low full toss, Behardien drives and doesn't try to hit it too hard either, the timing was so good and it raced away for four
SOUTH AFRICA:49.1 U Yadav to Behardien, FOUR, thank you very much, says Behardien and helps himself to another boundary. Juicy full ball, Behardien clears his front leg and lofts the drive back over the bowler's head for four
SOUTH AFRICA:48.6 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, FOUR, full toss outside off stump, de Villiers slices this one hand over backward point, Jinks runs to his left from sweeper cover and gets to the ball, he flicks the ball but it rolls back and touches the rope. 19 runs off the over
SOUTH AFRICA:48.5 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, 2 runs, full and outside off stump, de Villiers slices the drive uppishly towards sweeper cover
SOUTH AFRICA:48.4 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, no run, edged and Dhoni has saved a certain boundary. Full and outside off stump, de Villiers swings hard, gets an outside edge that rolls along the ground, Dhoni dives to his right and stops the ball
SOUTH AFRICA:48.3 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, SIX, it's 13 runs off the first three balls of the over, great start for the Proteas. Full and in the slot, de Villiers goes for the loft, but doesn't time this that well, just manages to clear Raina at long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:48.2 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, SIX, "How he generates the power from that position, I don't know?" says Graeme Smith on air. What a shot. Bhuvneshwar fails to nail the yorker, bowls a low full toss, de Villiers, who was backing away, somehow manages to get under it and muscles it back over the bowler's head
SOUTH AFRICA:48.1 Bhuvneshwar to Behardien, 1 run, slower delivery from Bhuvneshwar, Behardien drives it to long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:47.6 U Yadav to de Villiers, FOUR, Yadav misses the yorker and bowls a full toss, de Villiers accepts the gift and crashes it wide of mid-wicket, long-on had no chance as well
SOUTH AFRICA:47.5 U Yadav to Behardien, 1 run, good length delivery outside off stump, Behardien taps it to point
SOUTH AFRICA:47.4 U Yadav to Behardien, FOUR, gee! He was struggling to time the ball early on, but looks like he's got a measure of the pitch now. Full and wide outside off stump, Behardien goes for the drive, doesn't hit it hard and hits it to the right of the man at sweeper cover
SOUTH AFRICA:47.3 U Yadav to Behardien, no run, oh that almost shaved the off stump! Good length delivery outside off stump, Behardien was playing for the straight angle from the bowler, but it swung back in and foxed him, Behardien tries to adjust the drive but is beaten all ends up
SOUTH AFRICA:47.2 U Yadav to Behardien, no run, fullish and on the leg stump, Behardien checks the flick, the ball goes on the bounce to short mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:47.1 U Yadav to Behardien, FOUR, driven nicely and it's in the gap as well. Full and outside off stump, Behardien drives it wide of mid-off and begins the over in style
SOUTH AFRICA:46.6 Bhuvneshwar to Behardien, 1 run, slower delivery outside off stump, Behardien drives it through point again, Jinks rushes forward from the deep and prevents the second run

SOUTH AFRICA:46.4 Bhuvneshwar to Behardien, 1 run, good length delivery outside off stump, Behardien punches it through point
SOUTH AFRICA:46.3 Bhuvneshwar to Behardien, FOUR, edgedddd and that's too fine for both Dhoni and third man. Short and outside off stump, Behardien hops and tries to upper-cut, the ball goes off the outside edge and goes for four
SOUTH AFRICA:46.2 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, 1 run, ABdV rocks back and pulls, again doesn't manage to find the sweet spot on the bat, the short ball takes the toe-end and goes to the right of deep mid-wicket. After completing the run, ABdV almost bangs the bat onto the ground in disappointment that he missed out on a boundary scoring opportunity
SOUTH AFRICA:46.1 Bhuvneshwar to Behardien, 1 run, full and outside off stump, Behardien drives it to long-off and gets off strike, much to the delight of the South African fansBhuvneshwar Kumar [8.0-0-39-0] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:45.6 U Yadav to Behardien, 1 run, fullish and outside off stump, Behardien drives it square of the wicket on the off-side, he'll retain strike, something that India won't mind. Interestingly, ABdV didn't face a ball in that over
SOUTH AFRICA:45.5 U Yadav to Behardien, no run, where are you going Behardien? You certainly can't run ABdV out at this stage! Fullish and outside off stump, Behardien mistimes the drive straight to short cover and sets off, Raina was the fielder and he has a good arm, sensibly the South African captain yells out a loud no and sends his partner back. It could have been a disaster for South Africa had they attempted the run
SOUTH AFRICA:45.4 U Yadav to Behardien, 2 runs, poor line, full and on the leg stump, Behardien works it through backward square leg
SOUTH AFRICA:45.3 U Yadav to Behardien, no run, looks like the ball is stopping the batsman, Behardien was very early into his front foot drive, ends up pushing at it uppishly and luckily for him it doesn't carry to mid-off
SOUTH AFRICA:45.2 U Yadav to Behardien, no run, not convincing from Behardien, short of length delivery swinging back in, Behardien tries to defend half-heartedly and gets an inside egde onto padFarhaan Behardien, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:45.1 U Yadav to Duminy, out Caught by Dhoni!! Appeal for caught behind, Dhoni throws the ball up in the air after taking the catch and umpire Aleem Dar raises the finger. Once again Umesh Yadav takes a wicket off the first ball of his new spell. This though is a lucky wicket as it could so easily have been a wide. This length ball was way outside off stump, Duminy chased it looking to cut and got a faint nick. A key wicket for India and Duminy has been dismissed for the first time on the tour. Duminy c Dhoni b U Yadav 15(17) [6s-1]U Yadav to Duminy, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Umesh Yadav [7.0-0-34-1] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:44.6 Binny to de Villiers, FOUR, smashed! What an over for South Africa, 21 off it, just what they wanted at this stage. A really poor ball from Binny, can't bowl length at this stage, he tried to drag the length back on seeing de Villiers give the charge but it was not short enough to keep the batsman calm and de Villiers muscles the drive over extra-cover
SOUTH AFRICA:44.5 Binny to de Villiers, SIX, this is high in the airrrrrr, again not from the middle of the bat, long-on is interested for a while and moves back but it just clears the boundary. Full and in the slot and de Villiers is not someone who will miss out on these freebies
SOUTH AFRICA:44.4 Binny to de Villiers, FOUR, front leg out of the way and baaangg, not quite from the middle of the bat but the timing is still good enough to beat the man at deep mid-wicket. Once again gentle pace, de Villiers slogs and sends it for four
SOUTH AFRICA:44.3 Binny to Duminy, 1 run, Binny comes round the wicket, length delivery on the leg stump, Duminy works it behind square on the on-side
SOUTH AFRICA:44.2 Binny to Duminy, SIX, aaaha! Top shot sir! Length delivery right in the slot, with Binny not being express, Duminy walks towards the bowler and then plays a slog across the line, the ball flies off the middle of the bat and goes all the way over deep mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:44.1 Binny to Duminy, no run, nice and full outside off stump, Duminy mistimes the drive back to Binny himselfStuart Binny [7.0-0-42-0] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:43.6 Bhuvneshwar to Duminy, 1 run, fullish and on the stumps, Duminy drives it to long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:43.5 Bhuvneshwar to Duminy, no run, half-shout for LBW, but umpire Vineet Kulkarni walks away. Probably the ball pitched outside leg stump on that occasion, Duminy failed to work it on the on-side and got hit on the pad, impact wasn't a problem but it appeared as if it pitched outside leg
SOUTH AFRICA:43.4 Bhuvneshwar to Duminy, no run, clever bowling from Bhuvi, Duminy ducked under this one as soon as he saw the ball being banged short, but it was actually a slower-ball bumper and it went slowly past him and on the bounce to Dhoni
SOUTH AFRICA:43.3 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, 1 run, the inswing troubles de Villiers this time, the batsman manages to get an inside edge that rolls to short fine leg as he tries to adjust to the swing and defend
SOUTH AFRICA:43.2 Bhuvneshwar to Duminy, 1 run, short of length delivery on the leg stump, Duminy tucks it to deep square legOopsy! Not great news again, Ashwin is off the field.
SOUTH AFRICA:43.1 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, 1 run, a bit of shape back into the right-hander on this full ball, de Villiers drives it to long-off, crisp drive but Dhawan tidies up
SOUTH AFRICA:42.6 Ashwin to Duminy, no run, tight over that from Ash, just four singles off it. Duminy could only nudge this flighted delivery into the on-side and find the fielder
SOUTH AFRICA:42.5 Ashwin to Duminy, no run, tossed up on the stumps, blocked
SOUTH AFRICA:42.4 Ashwin to de Villiers, 1 run, floated up, de Villiers moves his front foot across and softly turns this to backward square leg
SOUTH AFRICA:42.3 Ashwin to Duminy, 1 run, tossed up on the off stump, Duminy pushes it to point and gets ABdV back on strike
SOUTH AFRICA:42.2 Ashwin to de Villiers, 1 run, quicker delivery down the leg-side, turned through backward square legAshwin v the well set ABdV. Ah! This is going to be exciting.
SOUTH AFRICA:42.1 Ashwin to Duminy, 1 run, flighted delivery just outside off stump, Duminy slices the drive uppishly through cover-pointRavichandran Ashwin [3.4-0-10-1] is back into the attackSlight delay as the umpire thought one more ball was left in the over, but he's been informed that the over has been completed and Bhuvneshwar gets his cap and walks off.
SOUTH AFRICA:41.6 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, FOUR, neatly done by the master. Bhuvneshwar just strays down the leg-side, de Villiers allows the length ball to come and tickles it fine and sends it to the fine leg
SOUTH AFRICA:41.5 Bhuvneshwar to Duminy, 1 run, well, well, this is a rare sight. How many times have we seen Bhuvneshwar hurrying the batsman with a bouncer? This was bowled at 140.9kph, Duminy checked his shot and hit it uppishly through the vacant square leg region
SOUTH AFRICA:41.4 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, 1 run, full on the leg stump, de Villiers drives it to long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:41.3 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, 2 runs, slower ball, hit in the air but no one at mid-off, doesn't carry to long-off either. That brings up the 48th ODI fifty for de Villiers and he gets a good round of applause from the crowd, who were chanting "AB, AB, AB," when he walked out to bat. He raises the bat to acknowledge the cheer. It was a full ball that was driven to the left of long-off
SOUTH AFRICA:41.2 Bhuvneshwar to Duminy, 1 run, this time Duminy pushes this full ball with soft hands to mid-off, sets off and makes his ground
SOUTH AFRICA:41.1 Bhuvneshwar to Duminy, no run, full ball outside off stump, Duminy toe-ends the drive past the diving Bhuvneshwar to mid-offEnd of a fine spell from Mishra. He finishes with figures of 10-0-47-2.

SOUTH AFRICA:40.3 Mishra to D Miller, out Stumped!! "Yeaahhhhhh," is the shout from Suresh Raina, who was moved to leg slip for Miller. This is a good bowling change from Dhoni and he gets the big wicket of David Miller. The left-hander was down the track to muscle this out of the ground, but got too close to the pitch of the ball and it spun back in sharply as well to beat the inside edge of the bat, Dhoni watched it nicely into the hands despite being blinded for a while by the batsman and broke the stumps. D Miller st Dhoni b Mishra 13(22)Mishra to D Miller, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!
SOUTH AFRICA:40.2 Mishra to de Villiers, 1 run, nicely tossed up this time, de Villiers waits and drives along the ground to long-off

SOUTH AFRICA:39.6 Bhuvneshwar to D Miller, no run, on a good length around off, Miller was looking to go more towards cover with his jab, again gets an inside edge onto pad. No cheeky single this time
SOUTH AFRICA:39.5 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, 1 run, again signs that this might not be a belter. The ball holds up on de Villiers and he checks his push along the ground to long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:39.4 Bhuvneshwar to D Miller, 1 run, a drop and run. The delivery was on a length around the fourth stump line, Miller gets a thickish inside edge which lands at his feet and he is called through by de Villiers
SOUTH AFRICA:39.3 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, 1 run, a similar delivery, this time de Villiers keeps his pull all along the carpet and straight at Mishra
SOUTH AFRICA:39.2 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, 2 runs, Mishra runs around and flicks the ball back in saving a couple of runs. Short of length delivery around rib-high, de Villiers looks to pull it fiercely but doesn't quite get hold of it. Was in the air but landed well short of a chasing Mishra
SOUTH AFRICA:39.1 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, no run, he is lining up the bowling now. On a back of a length just outside off, de Villiers was looking to wind up, but checks his push on the rise to cover as the length was not really thereBhuvneshwar Kumar [5.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:38.6 Binny to de Villiers, 1 run, angling into the pads on a fuller length, de Villiers flicks it through the vacant square leg region
SOUTH AFRICA:38.5 Binny to de Villiers, SIX, ladies and gentlemen, let me inform you that this man is now hitting his straps. Don't miss this stuff for anything. Short and at Binny's pace, it's good night. Pulled away fiercely over mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:38.4 Binny to D Miller, 1 run, fuller length delivery on off, driven down to long-off
SOUTH AFRICA:38.3 Binny to de Villiers, 1 run, the ball ricochets off the pad, maybe an inside edge, to backward point after de Villiers misses his flick, he sprints across to the other end. Had it in control all the timeAB de Villiers is quick, but is he in? By a foot. NOT OUT.
SOUTH AFRICA:38.2 Binny to D Miller, 1 run, closer to the body this time, flicked away through the square leg region
SOUTH AFRICA:38.1 Binny to D Miller, no run, on a good length just outside off, seemed like a fairly innocuous delivery, Miller got his bat down at an angle, but was late on it, cuts him in halfHooray! Ashwin is back on the field. Let the battle resume, err.. maybe not yet. He was off for a while and might not be able to bowl straightaway. There is a hold-up in play. Seems to be surrounding Ashwin, with the fact that whether or not he can bowl right now. Internal injury, external injury, all that stuff. Verdict is he has to wait
SOUTH AFRICA:37.6 U Yadav to de Villiers, 2 runs, work to do for sweeper cover. He sprints along the circumference to his right to cut out de Villiers' drive
SOUTH AFRICA:37.5 U Yadav to de Villiers, no run, fuller length delivery tailing in nicely on middle, de Villiers drives it nicely but straight to mid-on
SOUTH AFRICA:37.4 U Yadav to D Miller, 1 run, Rahane is quick at mid-off but Miller is quicker. Was a soft leading edge and the ball rolled away to the fielder's left. Miller was off in a flash and would have made it comfortably even with a direct-hit
SOUTH AFRICA:37.3 U Yadav to de Villiers, 1 run, yes he is focusing on staying leg side of the ball now, allowing it to do its bit. That's how you play reverse swing bowling. Punches this through the cover region
SOUTH AFRICA:37.2 U Yadav to de Villiers, no run, the ball ended up on de Villiers' hip after shaping in, he misses out on his tuck, drops at his feet off the thigh pad
SOUTH AFRICA:37.1 U Yadav to de Villiers, no run, veering into de Villiers on a length, he gets his front leg out of the way and pushes it on the rise towards mid-off

SOUTH AFRICA:36.5 Binny to de Villiers, no run, cutting back in around middle, on a length, de Villiers is cramped for room and gently defends towards mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:36.4 Binny to D Miller, 1 run, fullish off-cutter around off, Miller bunts it down to long-off
SOUTH AFRICA:36.3 Binny to D Miller, 2 runs, a gentle military medium pace good length delivery on the pads, too easy even for the new man. He gleefully tucks it behind square and returns for a couple beating the throw from fine leg
SOUTH AFRICA:36.2 Binny to de Villiers, 1 run, fuller length delivery angling in on middle, de Villiers wrists it down to long-onAshwin is on the sidelines having a chat with the physio, bowling coach and the fielding coach. He was seen practicing his bowling, perhaps testing if he can resume his duties
SOUTH AFRICA:36.2 Binny to de Villiers, wide, straying down leg, de Villiers misses with his glance
SOUTH AFRICA:36.1 Binny to D Miller, 1 run, a loopy low-full toss on middle, Miller gently taps it back at Binny who bends in his followthrough and makes a half-stopStuart Binny [5.0-0-24-0] is back into the attackDrinks are on the field now! Ashwin vs de Villiers 3.0 didn't have a winner, and it won't either. Unless, the physio pulls off something remarkable and Ashwin gets back on the field. He dived across and seemed to have hurt his back before walking off the field. Such an anti-climax after the mouth-watering build-up - what with de Villiers playing a host of mind games in the pre-match presser. Meanwhile, Umesh was brought back on and looks to have got some reverse going for him. He chugged down Faf with a reverse-swinging nut first ball of his spell.
SOUTH AFRICA:35.6 U Yadav to D Miller, 1 run, straying on the pads, bread and butter flick through square leg
SOUTH AFRICA:35.5 U Yadav to D Miller, no run, good length delivery in the outside off corridor, Miller guides his defensive push to backward point

SOUTH AFRICA:34.6 Raina to de Villiers, SIX, there goes de Villiers! He's had enough of nudging and pushing. Down the track he comes, the ball was in his swinging arc, and he lets in a clean swipe with the turn, forearms pumping. Ensured that he did not get too close to the pitch to get the desired elevation and sends it sailing over cow corner
SOUTH AFRICA:34.5 Raina to de Villiers, no run, pushed through the air on middle, de Villiers tucks it to mid-wicket

SOUTH AFRICA:33.2 U Yadav to D Miller, no run, swerving away from the left-hander on a length, Miller is up for it and defends off the front footDavid Miller, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:33.1 U Yadav to du Plessis, out Lbw!! Reverse swinging delivery bang on target first up. Not a bad weapon to possess, is it? du Plessis was certainly not expecting this. It was on a length and tailing back rapidly, du Plessis is caught on the crease as he tries to defend for a normal straight ball. Tries to adjust his hands, but the ball catches him on the pad before going on to hit the willow. Umpire Dar's finger went up in a jiffy. Would have crashed into middle at a reasonable height. du Plessis lbw b U Yadav 62(77) [4s-5 6s-1]U Yadav to du Plessis, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Umesh Yadav [4.0-0-25-0] is back into the attack

SOUTH AFRICA:32.2 Mishra to du Plessis, no run, well flighted delivery around off, du Plessis treats it with respect offering the full face in defence

SOUTH AFRICA:31.5 Kohli to du Plessis, 1 run, fraction fuller than a good length around off, du Plessis bunts it down to long-offVirat Kohli, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:31.4 Ashwin to du Plessis, 2 runs, Ashwin is going off it seems! The dive earlier in the over seems to have hurt his fingers bad. Coming to the ball, it was pushed through with the arm and was drifting across off, du Plessis steers it behind square on the off-side, easy couple before deep cover tidies up. Actually, might have been his back which is the culprit. A shame really. Kohli to continue
SOUTH AFRICA:31.3 Ashwin to de Villiers, 1 run, nicely flighted delivery on the stumps, this time he will get the single with a push to long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:31.2 Ashwin to de Villiers, no run, floated up on off, de Villiers fails to get the single away down to long-on as Ashwin dives to stop. Seems like his fingers have jarred on the ground

SOUTH AFRICA:30.4 Mishra to de Villiers, no run, flatter on off stump, a defensive push back to the bowler
SOUTH AFRICA:30.3 Mishra to de Villiers, no run, de Villiers is a lucky man. That one almost grazes off stump. Flatter delivery which drifts in with the arm, lands on off stump and turns away sharply. The batsman had made room and was perhaps looking to work it with the drift through the on-side. He is startled by the turn and the bat is nowhere near
SOUTH AFRICA:30.2 Mishra to du Plessis, 1 run, pushed through the air around off, du Plessis pushes it through the cover region

Bhuvneshwar will open the attackBhuvneshwar will start for India. Two slips in place for him..Right, we are set for the start of the only day game of this ODI series. The Indians are in a huddle. Amla and de Kock walk out to the middle, Dhoni believes that there will be a bit of help for the pacers owing to the early start. Can the Indian new ball bowlers make the most of the conditions?Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Stuart Binny, Ravichandran Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh YadavSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirMS Dhoni: "We were looking to bowl first anyway because of the early start. We are playing with two fast bowlers, Stuart Binny is playing this game. Mishra is the other spinner and of course Ashwin has done well for us. My batting position will depend on the situation. At times I do feel that I should bat at No. 4, but we have to see the strength of No. 5, 6 and 7, because that's where the game changes a lot. Whenever it has turned, we have always felt that we have had better control of the game. The good thing is the dew factor will not come into the picture today."AB de Villiers: "We are going to bat. This wicket deserves a bit of respect at the start. Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn are back, good to have them back and Quinton de Kock, who had good "A" series here is also back. Hopefully it turn for the likes of Duminy and Tahir in the second innings. We've played some good cricket in the last few years, hopefully we will do well today."South Africa have won the toss and have opted to batToss time!Pitch Report: "It's an early start. So you expect maybe the first 10 overs to do a bit. It looks like it is going to be pretty low and slow. There is a bit of grass which might hold the surface together. There could be a little of turn but the ball could come on quite nicely to the bat. It will be an interesting toss to see," reckon Sunil Gavaskar and Graeme Smith.Green Park has generally assisted the spinners and it wouldn't be a surprise if India opt to play three spinners. With this being a day game, the dew factor is out of the equation, meaning that the spinners will be able to grip the ball better. Moving focus to the South African camp, this what captain AB de Villiers said yesterday. "We know it's not going to be easy. Five ODIs in India, there will be lots of travelling, lots of different wickets and different grounds. It's going to be challenging but we've got the very important momentum on our side and we are looking to take that into the game tomorrow.It is quite unclear whether Ajinkya Rahane will get a game today. Dhoni has hinted that, with Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli taking the first three spots in the batting line-up, Jinks might not get the nod as the Indian captain feels that Rahane is not best suited to bat lower down the order. "He (Rahane) is more (effective) when he bats up the order with the field restrictions, and when he gets a good start, he can capitalize on the middle overs as well. Four is the number for Rahane. To some extent, even four is quite low for him. I've always felt he should bat up the order. Opening suits him really well. It's slightly difficult for him as of now," these were the exact words of Dhoni.Indian skipper MS Dhoni is expected to bat higher up in the order today. So that means that we will have a different player walking out at No. 6. Who will it be? Young Gurkeerat Singh Mann, who had a wonderful time in the domestic circuit, has been named in the squad, but speaking on the eve of the match, Dhoni has clearly said that Gurkeerat will not feature in the playing XI straightaway. Dhoni though was very positive about the Punjab lad as he has the ability to bowl useful off-spin and hit the ball long and hard.Good morning everyone! "We are a far more experienced side in the one-day format. And I see a really good contest between the two sides. It will be a very, very good contest." These were the words of India's Team Director Ravi Shastri in the build-up to the game. Oh yes! The excitement levels are pretty high for the 5-match ODI series. The T20I series was off to a cracking start at Dharamsala, we are here at Kanpur for the first ODI, it's a day game and we have two strong sides in store to entertain us.Preview:The disappointment of the T20I series behind them, India head into more familiar territory with the first of the five-match ODI series at the famous Green Park stadium in Kanpur. Quite a bit has changed in the 50-over format for the 2015 World Cup losing semi-finalists. After beating South Africa at the MCG enroute their seven-game winning streak in Australia, India suffered a series loss in Bangladesh before a second-string side won in Zimbabwe. South Africa faced a similar predicament when they toured Bangladesh but redeemed themselves in the home series against New Zealand when big guns AB de Villiers, Dale Steyn returned to the side.India have pertinent questions that need addressing, none more pressing than the middle-order conundrum. MS Dhoni, as he did in Bangladesh, will anchor the line-up from his new position at No.4 while Ajinkya Rahane will hope to convince the management of his limited-overs prowess. The pace attack will once again be under scrutiny with the Indian captain, making public his preference for medium pacers with control. India will want to shrug off the unnecessary negativity surrounding their limited-overs sides with a fast start to series.A tour of the sub-continent is never easy, especially if it is 72 days long like this one is for South Africa. The Proteas have begun well but will have to guard against complacency as there isn't room for any of it in a format Dhoni & Co. master.Date: October 11, 2015Time: 03:30 GMT, 09:00 ISTVenue: Green Park, KanpurWeather: Bright and sunny with a high of 38 degree Celsius.Team News:IndiaIndia have flirted with the No. 6 and No.7 roles in ODIs with sporadic success. Dhoni has, in the past, expressed his intention of playing a batting all-rounder there to allow himself and Suresh Raina to play with more freedom. Gurkeerat Singh Mann has been picked in the squad for the very reason but the Indian captain reckoned that the 25-year old would have to wait before first eleven opportunities became available for him. India will also look at the possibility of playing Amith Mishra as the third spinner, behind Ashwin and Axar, in a day game where dew will play no part. Ambati Rayudu scored a hundred in his last ODI outing against Zimbabwe and despite his twin ducks in the T20Is, should keep his place.Probable XI: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni (c&wk), Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Axar Patel, Amit Mishra/Stuart Binny, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav/Mohit SharmaSouth AfricaQuinton de Kock's strong showing in the A tour of India last month will, in all probability, put him in pole position to take up the keeper's gloves and the opener's slot. In the absence of ODI regulars Rilee Rossouw and David Wiese, David Miller finds himself with just the right opportunity to settle into the lower-middle order role, that had become the topic of much debate in the series against New Zealand. Faf du Plessis, who missed South Africa's previous ODI assignment due to injury, will return to shore up the top order while the return of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel could keep young pacer Kagiso Rabada out of the starting eleven.Probable XI: Quinton de Kock (wk), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers (c), JP Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Kyle Abbott, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirStats and Trivia:- Since scoring a hundred in India's WC opener against Pakistan, Virat Kohli has gone 10 ODIs without registering a 50+ score- Hashim Amla needs 27 runs to become the fifth player with 1000 or more ODI runs in 2015Quotes:"I don't think he (Ashwin) got me out in either of the two T20Is, but I got myself out. But he's a world class bowler and has to be respected."- AB de Villiers on his battle with Indian offie Ravichandran Ashwin."Ajinkya Rahane is more effective when he bats up the order with the field restrictions."- MS Dhoni hinted regarding the possibility of leaving Ajinkya Rahane out of the playing eleven.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Khaya Zondo, Aaron PhangisoIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Stuart Binny, Ambati Rayudu, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Axar PatelLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
