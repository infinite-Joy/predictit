Davison is on strike. Mpofu will open the attackIt has been a good batting display by the Zimbabweans but they would be feeling that they missed out on some more runs. After losing the openers early, Taibu and Ervine strung together a 181 run stand for the third wicket. This was a record third wicket stand for Zimbabwe in ODIs and it seemed Zimbabwe would cruise past 300. However, Balaji Rao wrecked the middle order by picking up four wickets. Taibu was very unlucky not to get to his hundred and Zimbabwe lost wickets in a heap. Some quick runs from Cremer and Utseya helped Zimbabwe reach 298/9, but Canada will be mighty pleased with the way the bowlers bounced back. It is now upto the likes of Davison and Cheema, two of Canada's premier batsmen, to stand up to the challenge and negotiate Zimbabwe's spinners. Join us in a short while for the run-chase.4

What a start to the match! it was a length delivery, which curves back in to strike him on the back pad, huge appeal first up and the umpire raises his finger, Taylor decides to review it, but replays suggest it struck him in line and would have hit the middle and leg stump, so the original decision stays, Taylor is gone for a golden duck, perfect start for Canada.

Alistair Capmbell reckons the team which wins the toss will definetely bat first on this track.Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the 12th match of this World Cup between Zimbabwe and Canada. Zimbabwe will be looking to secure a win under their belt after their impressive performance against the Aussies. They will have to bank on their spinners, who performed very well against Australia. On the other hand, Canada had a disastrous start to this tournament losing very badly to the Sri Lankans. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info....By Gokul GopalWhile this game might not generate much public interest, and in all likely-hood empty seats might welcome the two sides, Zimbabwe get set to take on Canada at Nagpur and would be hoping to secure a win under their belt. Although not many would be watching this match, ICC would be closely scrutinizing this game to determine the feasibility of including minnows in future 50-over World Cups. Both sides need to come up with good performances and make it a closely fought encounter to prove to the ICC that the minnows too have an important role to play in the World Cup.Head to Head:Both these sides have played against each other only once. Zimbabwe and Canada faced off in 2006 at Port of Spain where Zimbabwe successfully defended a total of 218 by bowling out the Canadians for a paltry 75.Build up to the game:Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe did not get off to the best of starts in the build up to the World Cup, losing their warm-up games to South Africa and Ireland. However, the did come up with a good performance against the Australians in their opening match of the big event. The spinners performed well for the African team to restrict Australia from posting a huge total. Ray Price, Prosper Utseya and Graeme Cremer bowled economically to restrict the Kangaroos to a total of 262/6. However, the batsmen struggled against the pace of Mitchell Johnson and none of them managed to get a decent score as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 171. Zimbabwe would not be facing an attack as hostile as that of Australia but the batsmen need to show more application and with the likes of Brendan Taylor, Charles Coventry, Tatenda Taibu, Craig Ervine and the skipper Elton Chigumbura in the ranks, the African side would be hoping for a decent show with the bat. When it comes to bowling, Zimbabwe will again rely on spinners to keep the pressure on Canada. The Chigumbura-led side are facing a virtually impossible task of reaching the quarter-finals with Pakistan, Australia, Sri Lanka and New Zealand dominating the group. However, they would hope to get as many wins as possible and in some way upset the quarter-final chances for one of the top sides in the group.Canada: While the Canadian skipper Ashish Bagai is against ICC's policy on the minnows and has been voicing his opinion constantly, his team has hardly been able to prove the governing body wrong. They had a disastrous outing against the Sri Lankans in their opening match. The co-hosts posted a mammoth total of 332/7 and in reply the North American side was skittled out for just 122. Canada have the explosive John Davison, who hammered a 67-ball hundred against the West Indies in the 2003 edition of the World Cup and they also have Rizwan Cheema who almost pulled off the impossible with his 71-ball 93 against England in the warm-up game. Canada would be determined to give an improved performance and provide the fans back home something to cheer about.Pitch and Ground Conditions: The Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Jamtha, Nagpur has so far hosted 2 World Cup games. The first game saw a high-scoring encounter between England and Netherlands and the Poms needed to stretch themselves till the end while chasing a challenging total of 292 by the Dutch. The Australians had an easy outing against the Kiwis in the second game, comfortably chasing down a target of 207. But it has to be noted that the first one was a day-night encounter and the batsmen from both sides had the best of conditions while the second match, which was a day game, assisted the seamers initially. With the Zimbabwe-Canada encounter also a day match, the team winning the toss is likely to bowl first.Captains speak:It's a big positive for the team, I thought our bowling and fielding was superb (against the Aussies). It's something that we have to carry on in the rest of the tournament. Now we just have to work on our batting. We just have to make sure that we keep wickets in hand in the early period: Zimbabwe skipper Elton Chigumbura, saying that the team have to work on the batting.
I think it's going to be a game of spinners. They have got a couple of good spinners bowling early overs and if we can get through those overs and score at a consistent rate we can do well. It's the same with our bowling. If we can get our spinners to fire on that day, hopefully it will work for us: Canada skipper Ashish Bagai, mentioning that spin would play a big part in the match.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Brendan Taylor, Charles Coventry, Tatenda Taibu(w), Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sean Williams, Regis Chakabva, Prosper Utseya, Graeme Cremer, Ray Price, Chris Mpofu, Sean Ervine, Gregory Lamb, Shingirai Masakadza, Tinashe Panyangara, Terry DuffinCanada (From): John Davison, Ruvindu Gunasekera, Nitish Kumar, Zubin Surkari, Ashish Bagai(w/c), Rizwan Cheema, Tyson Gordon, Khurram Chohan, Harvir Baidwan, Balaji Rao, Henry Osinde, Parth Desai, Jimmy Hansra, Hiral Patel, Karl Whatham, Hamza TariqLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
