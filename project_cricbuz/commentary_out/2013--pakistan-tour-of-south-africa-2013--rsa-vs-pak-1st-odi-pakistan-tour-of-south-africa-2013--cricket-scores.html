PAKISTAN:36.2 36.2 Kleinveldt to Shahid Afridi, out Caught by Behardien!! What a catch! Short on middle, Afridi pulls it, but does not get hold of it. The ball was dying on Behardien at deep midwicket, but he runs forward, dives and takes it inches from the ground. Boy, this South African line-up is filled with some excellent fielders. Afridi's entertaining cameo comes to an end. Shahid Afridi c Behardien b Kleinveldt 34(16) [4s-2 6s-3] Kleinveldt to Shahid Afridi, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Younis Khan punched this firmly down the track but it appeared to have flicked Kleinveldt's fingers on the way. Hafeez was guilty of backing up too far and was nowhere in the picture when the stumps were broken. Hafeez run out (Kleinveldt) 25(38) [4s-3] Kleinveldt to Younis Khan, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Not sure what we're still waiting for. OUT! There comes the decision finally.Meanwhile, replays show that Kleinveldt did get a finger on it. It seems so. Very interesing decision to be made by Billy Bowden. The only doubt is if Kleinveldt did get a finger on it. The wait continues. More zoomed in replays coming in. Nothing conclusive yet.Lot of confusion here. Younis drove this down the ground and it hit the stumps at the other end. Kleinveldt thinks he got a hand on it. If that was the case, Hafeez was run out. That does not stop the Pakistani duo from running. They ran 3 even as the South Africans went into a huddle

This one turned sharply from outside off and was good enough to beat Younis Khan's defense.Another loud appeal for a caught behind. South Africa go for a review now. Younis Khan is confident that he'd not hit it. Waste of a review that. The ball has missed by quite a bit. This will go in Younis Khan's favour.
PAKISTAN:10.1  Peterson to Younis Khan, no run, a very loud appeal straightaway as Peterson is hit on the pad. Peterson had walked across to work it on the onside but the impact was probably outside offRobin Peterson, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attac

PAKISTAN:6.6  Tsotsobe to Hafeez, no run, Whoa! Faf du Plessis drops one. An absolute sitter at that. Very good fortune for Hafeez. He got a thick leading edge off a good length delivery. The ball went high and straight to Faf at backward point. He was already jumping up in the air but spills the catch, to the utter disbelief of his team-mates
PAKISTAN:6.5  Tsotsobe to Hafeez, FOUR, not a bad length but there was width on offer. That allows Hafeez to free his arms and he does so with delight. That was smashed really hard to the cover boundary
PAKISTAN:6.4  Tsotsobe to Hafeez, no run, on a good length and just outside off, Hafeez stands up to defend

PAKISTAN:2.4  Tsotsobe to Hafeez, no run, full and outside off, Hafeez leans out to punch it to coverGrame Smith's words from slip has not pleased Hafeez. He had a word with the umpire about it but that seems to have egged Smith on more.

PAKISTAN:2.2  Tsotsobe to Hafeez, no run, Hafeez walks down the track now. It does not put Tsotsobe off though. The slightly short of length delivery hits Hafeez on the thigh as he misses the pull

Tsotsobe will open the attackWelcome back. We're all set for the chase.The first question that comes to my mind is: why did Pakistan opt to field on this wicket? It's flat but getting a bit slower and assisting the spinners with time. Anyways, all the South African batsmen have enjoyed batting on this track and that has resulted in a 300+ score. Colin Ingram made a century and skipper AB de Villiers scored a vital 65, but the contributions of Amla, Smith and then Behardien were very vital too. Can Pakistan chase this down? Join us at 14:15 local time.4

SOUTH AFRICA:37.1  Shahid Afridi to Colin Ingram, no run, well well. They didn't even bother going to hawk eye. This was full and straight, Ingram looked to sweep and missed, the ball would have hit the stumps but the third umpire reckons there was some slight glove on that one. Impossible to confirm, it really is impossible to confirm. The benefit of doubt has gone to the batsmanA huge appeal for lbw not given. Afridi wants a review. He doesn't even bother consulting anyone else, he asks the umpire to go up straightaway. Nothing on the bat. Hits him in line. The third umpire is seeing a lot of replays to check whether it hit the glove before hitting the pad. It doesn't look like it hit the glove; in fact, it hit the forearm. Did it brush the top of the glove before it hit the forearm? It's almost impossible to say. This could go either way. Billy Bowden is the third umpire. He rules it NOT OUT.
