ENGLAND:49.4 Malinga to Buttler, out Buttler Run Out!! Why did you leave the crease Buttler? You could have easily gone back into the crease and Tredwell would have been out.

ENGLAND:49.2 Malinga to Jordan, out Caught by Dilshan!! Is Malinga going to do it again for Sri Lanka? Full delivery in the slot, Jordan looked to smash it hard, he hit it well but didn't get underneath it, the ball went flat and straight to Dilshan at long-on.

ENGLAND:47.2 Malinga to Buttler, FOUR, wow! He's just dug out a yorker for four. Why is mid-off inside the ring at this stage? He was very square as well, the fielder had no chance
ENGLAND:47.1 Malinga to Buttler, 2 runs, slower delivery on the off stump, Buttler goes leg-side to give some room, he pushes it past backward point and he's back for the second before the man at sweeper tidies upLasith Malinga [8.0-2-38-2] is back into the attack

ENGLAND:45.5 N Kulasekara to Jordan, 1 run, Buttler wants the strike, there was never a run in it as Jordan tapped this length ball straight to point. Had the fielder hit the stumps at the bowler's end, Jordan would have been OUT

ENGLAND:43.5 Malinga to Buttler, 1 run, a big mix-up and a direct-hit would have been the end for Buttler.

ENGLAND:41.5 N Kulasekara to Bopara, 2 runs, the fielders have to pull up their socks, a sloppy misfield and Sanga is furious. Thirimanne was the culprit. Only driven to mid-off, should have been only a single but the fumble allows them to come back

There will be some movement early on but overall looks like a good wicket. The team environment has been positive even though we lost the last game. We have to play positive cricket. We have couple of changes, Chandimal and Herath are out, Kusal Perera and Mendis are in."Cook: "We are going to have a bowl. It looks like a good wicket but it's an early morning start and there will be some purchase at the start. It is also difficult to defend at Lord's. The energy in the last match was pretty amazing and hopefully we can carry that forward. We are playing the same team."Teams:England (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, James Anderson, Harry GurneySri Lanka (Playing XI): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha MendisSri Lanka make two changes, Kusal Perera and Mendis replace Chandimal and Herath.

The visitors, on the other hand, will hope to keep their chances alive with a win. Will Sri Lanka keep their good run in 2014 intact? Or will England begin their resurgence? We will find out soon. Toss and teams coming up in a few mintutes. Stay tuned.....Hello and a warm welcome to the fourth ODI between England and Sri Lanka. The weather is gorgeous, bright and sunny with no rain clouds looming in the horizon. It is a perfect day for the hosts to clinch the 5-match ODI series. After bouncing back from the humiliating defeat at the Chester-le-Street, England took a 2-1 lead in the previous ODI at Manchester, all thanks to Chris Jordan's remarkable bowling performance.Preview by Gokul GopalAfter suffering a humiliating defeat in Chester-le-Street, England returned the favour in Manchester to take a 2-1 lead. The hosts, buoyed by their recent win, will look to clinch the 5-match ODI series when they take on Sri Lanka in the fourth ODI at Lord's. The visitors, meanwhile, will be eager to make a strong comeback and stay alive in the series.The series so far:After ending up on the losing side in the lone T20I, the hosts started the ODI series well with a convincing 81-run win (D/L method) at The Oval. However, they were completely outplayed in the second match, bowled out for 99 in a chase of 257. The shocking loss worked like a wake-up call as the Alastair Cook-led side came up with a superb showing in the third match, bowling out Sri Lanka for 67 - their third lowest total overall and their lowest against England - before getting to the target with ease.England:Ian Bell and Gary Ballance started off with half-centuries in the opening ODI while Joe Root and Chris Jordan also came up with important contributions in that game. However, none of the England batsmen, barring Eoin Morgan, did anything noteworthy in the second game. The captain fell cheaply in the first match while he missed the second due to an injury. The left-handed opener looked fluent during his unbeaten 30 in the third game and the hosts will be hoping that he carries on and comes up with a big knock. Ian Bell has been amongst the runs, apart from his failure in the 2nd ODI, and his good form augurs well for the home team. Morgan's fighting innings in Chester-le-Street would have also impressed the team management and they will be hoping that he delivers again while they will also expect the likes of Ballance, Root and Ravi Bopara to contribute.In the bowling department, Chris Jordan has been a superb find for England. His fine all-round showing earned him the Man of the Match award in the first game while he picked up a career-best 5/29 in Manchester to win his second MoM of the series. England will be hoping that the 25-year-old continues his impressive run. The experienced James Anderson has been on the mark and has regularly delivered crucial strikes at the start of the innings. Harry Gurney and James Tredwell too have been amongst the wickets. England will be hoping that they continue in the same vein and help the hosts take an unassailable lead in the series.Sri Lanka:The Lankan batsmen have been very inconsistent in the series so far and that has reflected in the results. While Tillakaratne Dilshan has been amongst the runs, including a crucial 88 in the 2nd ODI, the rest of the batters have not quite made a mark. Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene have fallen cheaply twice, which is the same case with skipper Angelo Mathews. Lahiru Thirimanne has been struggling for runs while Dinesh Chandimal's poor form this year has continued. Ashan Priyanjan showed a lot of promise with his quick-fire knock in the second match. However, like the rest of the batsmen, he too failed in the third ODI. Sri Lanka need the batting department to click as a unit and the onus will be on the seniors to deliver while the youngsters too will have an important role to play.When compared to the batsmen, Sri Lanka's bowlers have been slightly better although there is still a lot of room for improvement. Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara went for plenty in the opening match. However, they came back well in the second game and it was Kulasekara who started the England collapse with an inspired bowling performance with the new ball. The most impressive of the lot has been Sachitra Senanayake. The England batsmen have struggled to read Senanayake and the off-spinner has profited a lot from that, registering figures of 3/30 and 4/13 in the first two games. In the third ODI, the Lankan bowlers could not do much after a pathetic display from the visiting-team batsmen. Sri Lanka will require the batsmen and the bowlers to complement each other and come up with a strong performance to prevent England from taking the series.Team News:England are unlikely to make any changes to their line-up. The visitors, on the other hand, have a couple players in their line-up who are struggling. With three failures on the trot, Thirimanne and Chandimal might not be persisted with. Hard-hitting left-hander Kusal Perera is a good choice at the top of the order in case Sri Lanka decide to leave out Thirimanne while Chaturanga de Silva and Thisara Perera will be vying for Chandimal's spot.Weather and Pitch:Clear skies have been predicted for the match day, which is good news for both teams. As far as the pitch is concerned, it is expected to provide more assistance to the quicker bowlers.Numbers:65: The number of runs Alastair Cook requires to surpass Marcus Trescothick as the highest run-getter for England against Sri Lanka in ODIs. Trescothick has scored 697 runs while Alec Stewart is currently second on the list with 683 runs.60: The number of runs Kumar Sangakkara requires to become the third Sri Lankan player with 1000 ODI runs against England. Mahela Jayawardene tops the list with 1291 runs, followed by Sanath Jayasuriya, who has scored 1195 runs.Quotes:He works incredibly hard at his game and he hasn't changed with his success in international cricket so far. He knows you have to keep your feet on the ground in this game but I've got no doubt he will do that and continue working hard: Alastair Cook on Chris Jordan.The first ten overs at Lord's and Birmingham are going to be vital. With this weather around, we're really going to need solid openers. Thiri is one of them. Unfortunately he hasn't got enough runs yet: Angelo Mathews hinting that Thirimanne might be given another go.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Chaturanga de Silva, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Thisara Perera, Kushal Janith Perera, Dhammika PrasadEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, James Anderson, Harry Gurney, Chris Woakes, Michael Carberry, Tim Bresnan, Alex HalesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
