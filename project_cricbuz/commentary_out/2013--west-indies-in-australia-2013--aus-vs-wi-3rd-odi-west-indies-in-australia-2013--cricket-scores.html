Kieran Powell is on strike. Clint McKay will open the attackSurprise first up: Gayle is not opening. He has a side strain, and will bat at number 7.On one of the best batting wickets, Australia have set West Indies a huge target. Shane Watson was the star with a 122 on his return to the team. It was an innings full of robust strokes - typical Watto stuff and well complemented by Hughes, who started off slowly but upped the tempo as the innings wore on. The Windies bowlers didn't have a clue and apart from a couple of out of the world catches from Pollard, their ground fielding was pretty ordinary. Their batting hasn't fired at all in this series and it will need a big effort to win this. But at least the pitch is a beauty which should aid them. We will back shortly for the chase.4
AUSTRALIA:49.6  Dwayne Bravo to Mitchell Johnson, 2 runs, short-arm jabbed to long on. Good enough for a couple. Australia end on 329. West Indies need 330 to stay in the series.

The giant lands with feet intact on the ground. George Bailey c Pollard b Narine 44(22) [4s-6 6s-1] Narine to George Bailey, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

AUSTRALIA:47.6  Roach to George Bailey, 2 runs, pushes it between midwicket and long on, comes back for the second
AUSTRALIA:47.5  Roach to George Bailey, FOUR, that is an amazing shot. Pre-meditation involved in that but George Bailey has pulled it off.

AUSTRALIA:46.4  Narine to Glenn Maxwell, out Caught by Pollard!! Folks this is one of the great outfield catches of all time. Simply unbelievable stuff from Polly. The crowd show their appreciation while Glenn Maxwell just walks off in disbelief.

The ball stuck and as the big man landed he came up with the ball intact. What a catch - astounding effort. This one will go definitely on YouTube soon.

AUSTRALIA:45.6  Sammy to Glenn Maxwell, 2 runs, Thomas has made a mess of that chance. Was a run-out opportunity but he was late in bringing it back onto the stumps. The throw came in on the bounce to him from deep square leg and Thomas took a lot of time to break the stumps. Glenn Maxwell is in
AUSTRALIA:45.5  Sammy to Glenn Maxwell, 2 runs, pushed between midwicket and long on, placed in the gap and they come back for the secondGlenn Maxwell, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:45.4 Sammy to Hughes, out Caught by Devon Thomas!! That is a brave piece of wicket-keeping from Thomas. He is in pain after that last delivery and has now caught a difficult chance. Hughes went after a length ball outside off and got an inside edge, the ball got lodged in between Thomas' thighs. Managed to hold on in the end.

AUSTRALIA:44.6  Pollard to Hughes, 1 run, played to point, a single taken

Looks plumb after Michael Clarke missed a swipe to leg. But the replays show that Clarke has just got outside off.

Wide called thoughShane Watson and Finch are at the crease. Shane Watson is on strike. Roach will open the attackTeams:West Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Kieran Powell, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Andre Russell, Kemar Roach, Sunil NarineAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Phillip Hughes, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Matthew Wade(w), Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Clint McKayAustralia have won the toss and elected to batMitchell Starc has proved to be almost unplayable - he is on the verge of a hat-trick of five-fors, having dismantled the West Indies with his potent swing bowling. Will he once again destroy them? One good news for the visitors though is that the Manuka Oval is generally known to be a good batting surface which should negate some of Starc's firepower.Must win situation for the West Indies as they go into the third ODI against Australia facing a lot of problems. Their batting has failed miserably and it has left their bowlers with no chance. Australia fought back wonderfully in the last ODI with the much criticised George Bailey scoring a magnificent ton. The good news for Australia is that Shane Watson is back and that means more pressure on the Windies.
