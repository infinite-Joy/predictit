Sangakkara and debutant, Priyanjan forged a recovery but neither stayed on through to the end of the innings. The wicket of Priyanjan, in particular, triggered a collapse. Mathews was running out of partners before he fell victim to the guile of Ajmal, who was running amok in the death overs. The target is not too high but not too low. It could be one of those tricky chases. Can Pakistan wrap up the series later in the day? Join us in a short while to find out.4

Two slips in place
SRI LANKA:44.2  Ajmal to Senanayake, out Bowled!! Ajmal is on a hat-trick! That was beautifully bowled by Ajmal.

Mathews lbw b Ajmal 38(46) [4s-2 6s-1] Ajmal to Mathews, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Mathes has been given out LBW. That looked plumb but the skipper has reviewed it. He had no other choice really. That's hitting middle of middle stump. Surely, Mathews is a goner. Did not look like an inside edge but they are seeing a few more replays. No snicko or Hot Spot available. Just the normal replays. You can't say anything from these. No evidence to overturn the on-field decision. This is taking an awful lot of time

Hello and welcome to the fourth ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka at Abu Dhabi. Let's hope tonight's game is not as one-sided as the last one was. Toss and teams in a few minutes, stay tuned....Pakistan ride high on the form of their captain Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Gul, who made a strong comeback after a nine-month layoff. In comparison, their opposition has been listless and rarely given a fight except for the 2nd ODI which they won. Sri Lanka might consider making some changes to their side and Chandimal will have to try a different and more aggressive approach if he plans to keep their chances in the series alive.There is something strong about this Pakistan team. Despite having a comparatively mediocre batting unit than the opposition, they have managed to give an all-round peformance this ODI series. Already leading 2-1 and with two more matches to go, they would like nothing more than to secure a win today itself and clinch the series. On the other hand, Sri Lanka have failed to fire as a unit and a few individual performances here and there have not helped them to dominate the other team completely.Preview by Gokul GopalPakistan came up with a superb all-round display in Sharjah to go 2-1 up in the ODI series against Sri Lanka and the confident hosts will be looking to clinch the series in the fourth ODI to be played in Abu Dhabi. Sri Lanka, who showed good fight in the first two games, were not up to the mark in the third match and they will be hoping to make amends and square the five-match series.Pakistan: While Ahmed Shehzad extended his good form, scoring a fine 80 as a follow-up to his ton in the second game, Mohammad Hafeez scored a brilliant unbeaten 140 to register his second hundred of the series. Misbah-ul-Haq, who contributed with a useful 40 in the third game, will be hoping that the batsmen continue their good showing in the remaining two games. He will also be eager for Sharjeel Khan, who failed in back-to-back games after scoring a fifty on debut, and Sohaib Maqsood to do well with the bat.The return of Umar Gul was a big boost for the Pakistan team as the experienced pacer did a splendid job with the ball, picking up three wickets while giving away very less. Junaid Khan extended his wicket-taking form, adding a couple of wickets to his tally while Saeed Ajmal, Hafeez and Shahid Afridi also came up with good performances to bowl Pakistan to a 113-run win. Misbah and the team management will be hoping that they continue in the same vein and clinch the series, which will be a good parting gift for coach Dave Whatmore.Sri Lanka: Just like the previous matches, Sri Lanka's top order failed to contribute as a unit, which led to their second loss of the series. While Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a fighting half-century, the rest of the batsmen failed to come to the party. Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews could not convert their starts while Kusal Perera, Dimuth Karunaratne and Kumar Sangakkara got out for low scores. Sri Lanka will be hoping for the batsmen to show better application and come up with bigger contributions as they fight to stay alive in the series.Sri Lankan bowlers were again mediocre as they let Pakistan score in excess of 300 for the second time in the series. Lasith Malinga's poor run in the series continued as he picked up a lone wicket while giving away close to six an over. Sachitra Senanayake and Seekkuge Prasanna conceded less than 6 but they did not contribute in terms of wickets. Thisara Perera, while picking up a couple of wickets, conceded plenty as did skipper Mathews, who will be hoping for a better performance from himself as well as the rest of the bowlers.Team News: Pakistan are unlikely to make any changes to their eleven although leaving out Bilawal Bhatti in favour of Anwar Ali remains an option for them. Sri Lanka might think of giving a batsman in the reserves a go after Dimuth Karunaratne failed in consecutive games.Numbers:14: The number of half-centuries scored by Misbah-ul-Haq this year. The Pakistan captain is the top run-getter in ODIs this year - 1322 runs in 32 matches at an average of 55.08.56: The number of wickets taken by Saeed Ajmal this year. He has a 4 wicket lead over Ravindra Jadeja who is placed second on the list of highest wicket-takers in 2013.Quotes:It's important to win the series in the fourth match so that we don't have to wait for the final game. Our team is doing well and the momentum is with us: Umar Gul.We have nothing to lose, we have to just go there and express ourselves and be confident to try and win because we need to stay positive to win: Angelo Mathews.Teams:Pakistan (From): Sharjeel Khan, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sohaib Maqsood, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Shahid Afridi, Umar Akmal(w), Bilawal Bhatti, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Anwar Ali, Haris Sohail, Sohail Tanvir, Abdur Rehman, Asad ShafiqSri Lanka (From): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith Malinga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kithuruwan Vithanage, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Ashan PriyanjanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
