Malinga will open the attackWe're back for the chase. Malinga marks his run-up as Sehwag and Gambhir walk in.India will review the tactics they employed with the ball today. Zaheer Khan bowled 9 overs in the powerplay and that allowed Sri Lanka to make use of the death overs. Dinda in particular took a beating, conceding 76 from his 10 overs. All's not lost though - this is still a good batting track and India sure have the firepower to chase it down. Let's see if they can, join us in half an hour.A pretty long first innings finally comes to an end. India would have probably forgotten by now that they had Sri Lanka reeling at 20/3 at one stage. Irfan and Zaheer got the new ball to talk and dismissed the top order, but Sri Lanka rebuilt through the experienced pair of Mahela and Sangakkara. Both went past their half centuries and build a solid foundation for the lower order to use.

SRI LANKA:5.3 Irfan Pathan to Chandimal, out Lbw!! This time Dharmasena raises his finger! Sri Lanka in early trouble here, Chandimal gone for a duck. Good length delivery pitching on middle, Chandimal played for the in-swing but it went straight on and hit him on the pads. Height looked a bit of an issue, but need a few replays to judge whether it would have gone over or not. Replays in: it hit him high on the pad but it was the back-pad, so not a bad decision at all. Sri Lanka 20/3. Chandimal lbw b Irfan Pathan 0(3) Irfan Pathan to Chandimal, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
SRI LANKA:5.2  Irfan Pathan to Chandimal, no run, an appeal for lbw but not given. Pitching on leg and hitting him high on the pads, might have gone down the leg side too

SRI LANKA:4.6  Zaheer to Chandimal, no run, an appeal for lbw but that pitched outside leg. Chandimal looks to flick and is rapped on the pads in front of middle stump, but that was pitching outside the lineDinesh Chandimal, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:4.5  Zaheer to Tharanga, out Caught by Dhoni!! One shot too many. Zaheer gets his revenge and a much deserved wicket. Once again width on offer but it moves away a touch, Tharanga stretches and looks to slash through the off side but only manages an edge, a good take by Dhoni as well who dives to his left to catch it. Zaheer roars in delight - he looks an angry man! Tharanga c Dhoni b Zaheer 8(20) [4s-1] Zaheer to Tharanga, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:4.4  Zaheer to Tharanga, FOUR, he connects one finally. A bit of width on offer, he reaches out and smashes it between cover and point, a bit uppish but there were no fielders there. First boundary of the Sri Lankan innings

SRI LANKA:2.3  Zaheer to Dilshan, out Bowled!! Oh dear! What has happened there? That's very very unlucky for Dilshan! A normal good length delivery on the off, Dilshan defends it softly with an angled bat and sets off for a run, he doesn't know where the ball is and keeps running, only to realise late that the ball has gradually sneaked past him to hit the stumps. Had he realised where the ball was heading, he could have at least kicked it away from the stumps. An early strike for India though, and a very important one on this flat track.

SRI LANKA:1.3  Irfan Pathan to Dilshan, 3 runs, Dilshan is away with 3, this one curves back into his pads, he works it to deep square leg region, good running gives him 3
SRI LANKA:1.2  Irfan Pathan to Tharanga, 1 run, misfield. Or was it a bad bounce? More of the former. Tharanga mistimes a pull to mid wicket where Gambhir lets it go through him
SRI LANKA:1.1  Irfan Pathan to Tharanga, no run, that's a weird way to leave, it was in the channel outside off and Tharanga decided to let it go at the last moment, looked to play initially but withdrew his bat lateIrfan Pathan, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:0.6  Zaheer to Dilshan, no run, full and moving away, Dilshan lets it go

Tharanga is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackZaheer: It's tough to play all 3 formats, but it's all about the mindset. We have to prepare according to the format. I try and stay in touch with the game - I concentrate on bowling fitness and look to bowl a lot of overs. It has worked well for me personally, I am at my best when I bowl more and more overs. It's an added responsibility that I'm the leader of the bowling attack. Earlier I had the luxury of having Kumble and Bhajji with me but it's up to me now. It's good to see Umesh, Dinda and Aaron bowling 140+. That's what you have to do as a youngster, as you gain more experience you can learn more tricks about the trade. I've been experimenting with my hair a lot - it's something I like doing but I have to rethink it now as the conditions are very hot and humid!Rohit Sharma keeps his place. Gambhir had spoken about 'the bigger picture' yesterday and said that Rohit needs to be backed as he is a part of the World Cup 2015 plans. Unfair on Manoj Tiwary? Or is it a good decision to back youngsters when they're out of form?Teams:India (Playing XI): Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Irfan Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Rahul Sharma, Zaheer Khan, Ashok DindaSri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Rangana Herath, Isuru Udana, Lasith MalingaDilshan: We bounced back well in the second match to level the series. Today is an important game as well. We are looking forward to have a good match. It's a different wicket now after the World Cup. The team needs a good start and we provided it in the last match. Thisara is doing well and Angelo has been doing a great job as well. The youngsters are doing well and that's a good sign for Sri Lanka's future. I have a bruised finger, it affected my fielding in the first two games but hope to be at my best today.Dhoni: Umesh and Ojha are out. Dinda and Rahul Sharma are in. Umesh has been expensive, we want him to narrow down his bowling areas. Dinda gives his all. It doesn't matter where he plays and for what team he plays - he gives his 100% even in the practice sessions. It's good to have someone like him in the side. We have to bat better, we rely on good starts and the middle order can capitalise on that.Mahela: We'll bat first. Looks a good wicket and it's a hard wicket. Since the World Cup, the wicket has been true and it has behaved well. It's a good ODI wicket. What we can control is how we play and concentrate on things which we can control. Thirimanne is dropped, Jeevan Mendis comes in. Both of them are in good form, it wasn't a major change for us.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: The pitch looks beautifully rolled. It's hard, flat and has an even spread of grass. The team winning the toss will want to bat first. The ball comes on a bit more in the evening, so the batsmen might enjoy batting in the second innings under lights too.Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the 3rd ODI between India and Sri Lanka. The series is interestingly poised at 1-1 with both teams blowing hot and cold alternatively. India defeated Sri Lanka comprehensively in the first ODI and the hosts returned the favour in the next, destroying India's batsmen for less than 150. Can the visitors forget the thrashing and bounce back? Stay tuned for the toss and other updates..Preview by Ganesh CThings are at an even keel after the first two ODIs. Neither team will consider themselves the outright favourites. Both teams have problems that need to be addressed and also some positives to help them go forward. That is what makes the scoreline (1-1) seem just about perfect ahead of the third ODI at the Premadasa stadium, Colombo.Sri Lanka: The hosts showed the right spirit after suffering a heavy defeat in the first ODI. They needed some sort of inspiration and that was provided by the canny Thisara Perera. It could be seen as a redemption of sorts too for the bowling unit too after the caning they suffered in the first ODI. Mahela Jayawardene will be put at ease if Lasith Malinga too gets back to his best. The slingy pacer was carted around in the first ODI and while he managed to salvage some pride in the next one, he still gives out an impression of lacking in confidence against the Indians.As in the bowling, the batting too has its share of positives and negatives. While the top three have been amongst the runs in the first two ODIs, the middle order does not inspire much confidence. Mahela himself will be eager to get back amongst the runs and set an example for the youngsters around him. India:As is the case with the hosts, India too have had some time to introspect on what went so wrong in the second ODI. Another aspect that is a little parallel to the hosts' story is the case of their batting. The top three have contributed but it is the others that are required to pull up their socks. Chief among them will be Rohit Sharma, if the think tank does decide to give him another game. With Ajinkya Rahane and Manoj Tiwary biting at his heels the talented Mumbaikar will be under great pressure to prove himself. Rahane and Tiwary will be prepared and eager to make use of the opportunity if they do get it. With Raina and Dhoni having done a good job in the first ODI, the batting worries are lesser in comparison to the hosts.However the bowling will be a cause of some headache for the captain. Zaheer Khan has been scratchy. Pragyan Ojha is a doubtful starter after haing been hit on the neck in a practice session. Umesh Yadav has been way too erratic and expensive. Ravi Ashwin and Irfan Pathan come out looking better than their team mates but nevertheless it is going to be a huge challenge for the bowling department to turn things around and inspire some confidence.Ground stats: In the previous seven completed ODIs at the Premadasa stadium, the team batting first has won only once.Final word:The toss may play a crucial factor in the game but the team that has worked towards ironing out the flaws will hold the edge.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Chamara Kapugedera, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Sachithra Senanayake, Upul Tharanga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Isuru Udana, Nuwan PradeepIndia (From): Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Virat Kohli, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashok Dinda, Gautam Gambhir, Zaheer Khan, Pragyan Ojha, Irfan Pathan, Virender Sehwag, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Rahul Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Manoj TiwaryLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
