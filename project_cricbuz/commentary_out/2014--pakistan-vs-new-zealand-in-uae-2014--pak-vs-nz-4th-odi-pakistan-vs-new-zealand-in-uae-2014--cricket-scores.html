Tanvir will open the attackTanvir will open the attack with two slips in placeThe umpires and the players walk out with black armbands, the mood is very sombre out thereAhmed Shehzad and Younis Khan are seen crying.Teams observe two minutes of silence in remembrance of the tragic terrorist attack in Peshawar yesterday which claimed more than 140 lives, of which 132 were children.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Dean Brownlie, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Tom Latham, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghanPakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Haris Sohail, Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi(c), Anwar Ali, Sohail Tanvir, Mohammad IrfanAfridi: "It was a big tragedy yesterday (referring to the terrorist attack in Peshawar). We are playing for them, we are playing for the people back home. My prayers are with them and hopefully things will go in the right direction. We have made two changes, Nasir Jamshed and Anwar Ali are playing in place of Asad Shafiq and Wahab Riaz."Williamson: "We will bat, we have made a few changes. Brownlie, Vettori and Milne replace Devcich, McCullum and Neesham. I think it's important that we adapt to the conditions here and do well."New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "Perfect weather for cricket here. The pitch doesn't have the sheen that was there in Sharjah. This is a venue where most runs will be had. The stats say that the quick bowlers are easier to score than the spinners. I would say win the toss, bat first and score in excess of 250," reckons Scott Styris.After yesterday's gruesome incident in Peshawar, which saw terrorists storm a local school and kill many children, middle-order batsman Younis Khan admitted that it will be very difficult for his team-mates to go ahead and focus on cricket.New Zealand on the other hand have not quite managed to click as a unit with the bat. If Taylor was the lone warrior in the first game, Kane Williamson and Anton Devcich were the only two to score in excess of 50 in the second match. Although a few of the batsmen got starts in the third ODI, they couldn't carry on and score big runs. For the series to stay alive, it is high time that the Black Caps play their best game today. There have been quite a few changes in both sides. It will be interesting to see the playing XI for both sides, toss and more in a short while.After a thumping performance in the last ODI, Pakistan are looking very strong and are high on confidence to seal the series today. Stand-in skipper Shahid Afridi was very impressed by his team's performance the other day and will expect something similar from his mates today as well. Afridi led from the front with an all-round show at Sharjah. A quickfire fifty was backed up by three wickets at a sensational economy rate of 3.96. Ahmed Shehzad played extremely well for his hundred and the rest of his mates made valuable contributions, barring a few. Haris Sohail's success with the ball has come at the right time for Pakistan, who were jolted by the ban imposed on Mohammad Hafeez for suspect bowling action.Preview:Having secured a crushing victory in the third ODI to take a 2-1 lead in the 5-match series, Pakistan will be keen to extend their good form and seal the series when they face off against New Zealand in the fourth ODI in Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, the visitors, who face a do-or-die situation, will be keen to come up with a clinical all-round performance and stay alive in the series.Pakistan:The hosts routed New Zealand by 147 runs in the third ODI in Sharjah, two days after losing by four wickets in what was an unimpressive show in the second match. Pakistan posted 364/7 - their highest total against New Zealand in ODIs - before dismissing their rivals for 217 in the third game. Ahmed Shehzad provided the ideal platform with a fine hundred while stand-in captain, Shahid Afridi's fiery 26-ball 55, along with quick-fire knocks from Haris Sohail and Sarfraz Ahmed, helped the hosts to a mammoth total. While Pakistan will be keen to repeat this performance, they will also expect the likes of Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan and Asad Shafiq to deliver with the bat.Afridi and Sohail starred with the ball as well, picking up three wickets apiece, while it was Mohammad Irfan who provided the initial breakthroughs to leave the visiting side reeling. Sohail Tanvir, who also came up with an useful contribution with the bat, did not take any wickets, but was economical. Wahab Riaz though did not have a good day with the ball, conceding a lot of runs while Haris too finished with an economy rate of more than 6. While Pakistan managed to secure a big win, they will be hoping that the bowlers show more discipline, while they will also hope for the fielding and catching is better.New Zealand:While Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson have been in good form and have scored bulk of the runs, they have not received much support from the rest of the batters in this series. Anton Devcich, barring a half-century, has not done anything substantial while the likes of Tom Latham, Corey Anderson and James Neesham have also failed so far in this series. Martin Guptill, in his lone outing in the third ODI, seemed out of place. New Zealand will be hoping that their batsmen can show better application and come up with a collective effort in the remaining two matches.Apart from Nathan McCullum, all the New Zealand bowlers were taken to the cleaners as the Pakistan batsmen made merry on a batting-friendly wicket in Sharjah. Matt Henry picked up three wickets, although he went at more than 7-an-over. Mitchell McCleneghan and Neesham also went for a few while Anderson was the most expensive of the lot, conceding 96 runs in his 10 overs. The New Zealand bowlers need to pull up their socks and bowl with a lot more discipline if they are to help their side level the series.Quotes:Our strength is playing aggressive cricket and if aggression is not there, you will not win. We will play hard the next game as well: Shahid Afridi hopes that Pakistan can sustain the momentum.Our performance wasn't upto par. We will look to bounce back and play better. We bowled the short balls better than the last game, but we still need to improve: Kane Williamson, after the 3rd ODI.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Anton Devcich, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Tom Latham, Corey Anderson, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Mitchell McClenaghan, Matt Henry, Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne, Dean BrownliePakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi(c), Wahab Riaz, Sohail Tanvir, Mohammad Irfan, Nasir Jamshed, Zulfiqar Babar, Yasir Shah, Anwar AliLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
