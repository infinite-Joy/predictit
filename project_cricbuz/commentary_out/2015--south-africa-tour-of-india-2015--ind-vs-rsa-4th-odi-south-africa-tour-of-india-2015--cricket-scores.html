SOUTH AFRICA:0.2 Bhuvneshwar to de Kock, no run, short of a length and just outside off, de Kock shuffles across and clips it towards mid-onRayudu is on the field for Kohli

INDIA:0.1 Bhuvneshwar to de Kock, wide, gentle start from Bhuvneshwar, short of a length and angling down the leg-side, called as a widede Kock and Amla are at the crease. de Kock is on strike. Bhuvneshwar will open the attackBhuvneshwar Kumar opens for India..Welcome back.. 300 hasn't been chased on this ground by any team and it will not be an easy chase on this surface today either. South Africa have reverted back to their opening combination of Amla and de Kock..Raina: "It was a very good start. Rohit started really well. Virat's knock was very crucial for us. He shared a good partnership with Rahane. We have got a good total on the board, we need to bowl in the right areas. I just wanted to spend some time in the middle. I was happy with the way I batted with Virat today. Later in the evening, it will be very difficult to rotate the strike against Harbhajan, Axar and Mishra. But they have a strong batting line-up and we need to bowl well. I will bowl a few overs as well."Dhoni tried his best to up the ante towards the end, but was hardly able to time the ball. Rabada impressed once again and was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets, while Steyn too bagged three. The run chase is going to be interesting. It is quite clear that the best time to bat on this surface is when the ball is nice and hard. The Proteas would hope that the dew comes on and makes batting easy. Take a break and join us back in a while for South Africa's reply.When South Africa removed both Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan early, it appeared as if South Africa would restrict India to a modest total, but a sensational 104-run partnership between Kohli and Rahane steadied the home side. Rahane fell 5 runs short of his fifty, but Kohli went on to record his 23rd ODI hundred. It was his first ton in 14 innings. Raina too was back amongst the runs after two successive noughts and he combined well with Kohli to share a brisk century stand.This is a strong comeback from South Africa. They conceded just 18 runs in the last 4 overs and accounted for as many as 4 Indian wickets. India were well on course to post 315-320, but they lost the plot towards the end. Nevertheless, with the pitch slowing down, they would be confident of defending this total. There are a few rough patches on the surface and the Men in Blue would feel that they have got enough runs in the bank.4

Remember, AB de Villiers has already been fined for slow over rate earlier in the series and the match referee would have a close eye on the over rate.This is how Vishaal describes the moment when Dhoni came out to bat: 'Massive reception for MS Dhoni. Deafening applause. The crowd right in front of the press box tore up the boundary cards and started throwing the bits of paper into the air. If the noise was loud, it hit the roof when he hooked his first ball to the fence.'

Steyn will open the attackIt's a hot and humid day in Chennai and India have won a crucial toss. Can they make it count? Steyn will open for South Africa. He has two slips in placeTeams:South Africa (Playing XI): David Miller, Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Aaron PhangisoIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Suresh Raina, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohit SharmaAB de Villiers: "It's a big toss to lose for us, but we love the challenge. Morne Morkel and JP Duminy are out with injuries, Chris Morris and Aaron Phangiso return. It's a great opportunity for us to wrap it up today."MS Dhoni: "We will bat first, looks like a decent wicket. Hopefully as the game progresses it will slow down to some extent. We are playing with the same side. We don't want to repeat the mistakes that we have done. We have played good cricket, but we have not finished games."India have won the toss and have opted to batMore on Morkel from Vishaal: 'Morkel didn't do any fielding practice, but is instead picking up the mats and plastic stumps left on the field. Morris, on the other hand, was involved during the fielding drills and also bowled a lot more.'Pitch Report: 'It looks very dry, there are a few cracks as well. There will be some turn for the spinners. It's a bat first wicket, it might get slower as the match progresses,' reckon Sunil Gavaskar and Graeme Smith.Vishaal, who's at the ground has more about Morkel's injury - 'Looks like Morkel is undergoing a last minute assessment. He's doing sprints while the rest of the team play Foot-tennis. Indian team have just finished stretching and are now doing fielding drills,' he says.Team News: India made just one change to the team that featured in the first three ODIs. Umesh Yadav, who was very expensive in the first two ODIs has made way for Sreenath Aravind. The left-handed pacer brings a different variety to the bowling. But will he find a place in the eleven? On the other hand, South Africa have been beset by injuries to JP Duminy and Morne Morkel. The former has been ruled out of the final two ODIs - replaced by Dean Elgar. Morkel is currently warming up and is bowling from a shorter run-up, but is he fit enough to feature in today's match? We will get to know during the toss which is a short while away..There has been a pattern in the three matches played so far. The teams batting first have managed to defend whatever total they have set. Even when some thought they are below par targets, chasing hasn't been easy. South Africa hold the edge going into the game as they have Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers and Farhaan Behardien in form. Amla has not got a big one, but we all know he is due for one. Morne Morkel and the young Kagiso Rabada have led the bowling attack well, with Dale Steyn and Imran Tahir supporting them.Chennai is a sort of a homeground for skipper, MS Dhoni. Having played for the CSK franchise over the past 8 years, he's become a huge fan favourite. He will need all the adulation and much more if India are to come out of this sticky position. Another man who will try and rekindle the fond memories of Chennai is Suresh Raina. He's often found himself in tough situations - but that's no excuse for the ill-timed slogs that he attempted in Kanpur and Rajkot, very early in his innings. With just 3 runs from this series so far, the left-hander is due for a significant contribution. Virat Kohli played himself into some form while Ajinkya Rahane's batting position still remains a mystery.India are in a do-or-die situation. They have never lost a home bilateral series to South Africa, but records are there to be rewritten. It isn't that India have not had their chances. They were pretty much coasting along during their chases in Kanpur and Rajkot, only to lose momentum mid-way and hurtle towards defeat. To their credit, South Africa kept fighting and deserved both their wins. Can the Proteas change a bit of history today? Hello and welcome to the fourth One Day International. We are at Chepauk on what is a balmy and humid day.Preview:With the chance of conceding the one-day international (ODI) series looming large, Mahendra Singh Dhoni's Team India have their backs to the wall in their lofty quest for survival as they host South Africa in the fourth fixture in Chennai on Thursday. The three 50-over fixtures thus far, have given a fair indication of how the visitors have been an all-round, well-oiled unit - rightfully in the lead while Dhoni & Co. have struggled to raise their game across all disciplines of the game simultaneously. There have been loose ends in both their losses which South Africa took full advantage of. The last time the iconic Chepauk hosted an ODI was way back in 2012 - a day match between India and Pakistan. Much has changed since, and despite being renowned for a turning wicket, Thursday's game is expected to be high scoring. The weather is expected to be typically hot - with temperatures wavering in the early 30s - and provide a stern test for the fitness levels of both the side. With India chasing parity, huge crowds will be expected to turn up at a venue known for its vociferous support. Unfortunately for the passionate fans, however, three stands - that can accommodate up to 4,000 fans each - will be empty and closed due to lack of official clearance. The stands have remained closed for a long period of time due to an unresolved issue between the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) and the Tamil Nadu Corporation. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court had even ordered the demolition of these three stands.Going into the Chennai fixture, India are grappling with a bit of negative energy surrounding Amit Mishra's alleged assault on a female friend in Bangalore and Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar's return home due to security fears. There also a hint of uncertainty in the batting order - with Ajinkya Rahane pushing down to number six despite getting two solid fifties at three. The move sent Virat Kohli back to his preferred spot at three and helped him rekindle his lost touch but in the most crucial phase of the game, during the chase, he uncharacteristically struggled to put bat to ball as the pressure was mounting. He eventually holed one out in the deep to kick-start the procession and a defeat. Dhoni, who batted at number four, endured a similar struggle as the South African bowlers did a fine job of drawing up a good plan and sticking to it, in their defence of 270. Despite recently getting his skipper and opening partner's backing, Shikhar Dhawan has treaded a fine line, with scores of 13 (29), 23 (34), 23 (28). There has been a recurring pattern to his dismissals so far - struggling to cut loose, allowing the pressure to mount and eventually perish while trying to break the shackles. It will be interesting to see if Dhoni brings in Ambati Rayudu in his place and pushes Rahane to open the innings with Rohit Sharma.Dhoni has, time and again, reiterated that the lack of a good finisher is hurting India's prospects in the limited-overs format. With an extra fielder outside the 30-year circle in the final ten overs, the hosts are in need of a highly-skilled batter who can counter South Africa's express pace and steer clear off the new rule. An opportunity for the Punjab youngster Gurkeerat Singh Mann could be a punt worth taking for the Indian skipper, if Mishra is kept out again. The 25-year-old, who claims to have modelled his game on Dhoni's and has his eyes set on the number five and six batting positions, has recently shown glimpses of being a potent all-rounder. In the recently-concluded A series against Bangladesh A, he scored 65 off 58 balls and followed it up with a fifer in the first of the three matches. A senior side call-up came before the conclusion of that series, which he celebrated with an unbeaten double century for Punjab in their comprehensive victory over Railways in the Ranji Trophy. With off-field controversy surrounding Mishra, Gurkeerat could get a shoo in while Umesh Yadav's return to the line-up could also be mulled.In the opposition camp, the gamble of trying an out-of-sorts David Miller worked to an extent as the Southpaw got going before being dismissed for 33 in Rajkot. AB de Villiers spoke highly of Miller and is expected to play him up the order again in Chennai. However, their main concern will be filling the spot of an effective all-rounder, left vacant by the injured JP Duminy, who has been ruled out of the last two ODIs. Dean Elgar, who can bat and bowl a bit of right-arm spin, has been called in as cover but it remains to be seen if he will have enough time to get into the groove and be part of the line-up. South Africa could also consider bringing in left-arm spinner Aaron Phangiso.The visitors are also sweating over the fitness of Morne Morkel - who put in a match-winning performances in the third ODI in Rajkot with figures of 4-39 and is currently the leading wicket-taker in the series with seven scalps. Morkel had suffered an injury to his leg in his sixth over but went on to bowl the entire quota, powering his side to a victory. "I'm not confident I'll be ready for the next game. It's just a matter now of the next 24 hours," Morkel had said after the victory in the third ODI and faces a race against time to regain fitness for the fourth. If Morkel misses out, De Villiers could turn to a similarly tall-framed fast bowler Chris Morris, who can also throw his bat around a bit.Probable XI:India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan/Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane/Ambati Rayudu, Amit Mishra/Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit SharmaSouth Africa: Quinton de Kock, David Miller, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers, Farhaan Behardien, Dean Elgar/Chris Morris, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel/ Chris Morris, Imran Tahir, Kagiso RabadaTeams:South Africa (From): David Miller, Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Farhaan Behardien, Khaya Zondo, Chris Morris, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Kyle Abbott, Aaron Phangiso, Dean ElgarIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Suresh Raina, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohit Sharma, Sreenath Aravind, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Stuart Binny, Ambati RayuduLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
