The target reads 150 in 26 overs.Finally, some good news. The covers are off, the conditions have improved. The match has been revised to 26 overs. Resumption time is 21:10 Local Time. We will let you know about the target as soon as we get some clarity.Brian Murgatroyd has tweeted that the umpires are inspecting the ground at the moment. We should get some news soon.The rain has stopped completely, and the ground-staff are hard at work. Still plenty of work to do though.India are ahead of the par score for the 20-over mark. In case the game is reduced to 20 overs, India will have to come out for just one ball to be declared winners since they are well ahead of the target that will be set if the game is reduced to 20 overs. The rain has stopped now, but the ground is flooded. Chances of resumption look bleak. If no more play is possible, then it will be ruled as a wash-out.The cut-off time to complete 20 overs is 21:45 Local Time.Mohandas Menon tweeted the following: Situation really looking bad. The ground at Mirpur is now flooded. Can't even see the covers!Bad news folks, it is pouring down at Dhaka. Do stay with us for further updates..It has started to rain. It is quite heavy as well.

He will be joined by Akshar Patel, who was very impressive for Punjab in the recently concluded Indian T20 League. Robin Uthappa will be playing his first ODI since the 2008 Asia Cup.Bangladesh have won the toss and have opted to batToss, teams and all the action heading your way in a short while.The last time India played an ODI, their XI read - Rahane, Dhawan, Rohit, DK, Kohli, Rayudu, Ravindra Jadeja, Ashwin, Mishra, Shami, Bhuvneshwar.He will look up to his left arm spinners to strangulate India into submission. Can Bangladesh turn over a new leaf in front of their adoring home crowd or will India's young guns fire? Greetings and welcome to the first of the short three-match ODI series between Bangladesh and India.Bangladesh have struggled in the past few months, so much so that they suffered defeats at the hands of Afghanistan and Hong Kong. Mushfiq though ruffled a few feathers when he lashed out at the Indian management for sending in a second string side.The spotlight is on India's fringe players. With as many as eight regulars including captain MS Dhoni and his deputy, Virat Kohli rested, Suresh Raina, who was cast aside for the Asia Cup, finds himself leading an under-strength yet talented team. Consistent performers in the Ranji Trophy and IPL have been rewarded. With the World Cup ticking closer, can the likes of Uthappa, Rayudu, Pujara, Akshar, Tiwary, Jadhav make people stand up and take notice of them?Preview by PradeepA few days after the completion of the Indian Premier League (IPL), and just a few days before the start of the lengthy England tour, India embark on a short visit to Bangladesh, three ODIs to be precise.With a hectic international calendar ahead, it was understandable when the BCCI named a weakened side for the series. While MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli were reported to have requested the board to not consider them for the tour, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Mohammad Shami have also been given a break. As such, Suresh Raina, who wasn't even a part of the last ODI squad (the Asia Cup), finds himself leading a bunch of talented youngsters, some of whom are trying to break into the national team, while for some others, it is time to show that there is still a chance for revival.India:With so many seniors rested, the onus will be on skipper Suresh Raina to lead the batting department. For company, he has the transformed Robin Uthappa at the top of the order - The Karnataka batsman is in the form of his life. After helping the South Indian state to a domestic treble (Ranji, Irani and Vijay Hazare trophy), he sparkled at the top of the order for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the Indian Premier League (IPL), playing a huge part in their title triumph. Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara are Test regulars, but they aren't yet confirmed starters in the shorter formats of the game. With the World Cup looming large, both get an opportunity to impress the selectors. Injury prone Manoj Tiwary makes a comeback into the national squad. His last appearance for India was against Sri Lanka in 2012, but untimely injuries has played a big part in him not being a regular part of the squad. Ambati Rayudu and Stuart Binny, who were part of the team in the ODI series against New Zealand have been retained, but will have to fight for their positions.While the batting looks impressive, the bowling department looks short on experience. Vinay Kumar gets another chance to get over the horror at 'Bangalore' against Australia last November where he became only the fifth international bowler to concede 100 runs in an ODI match. Umesh Yadav, controversially left out of the England Tests will get a chance to prove the selectors wrong while Mohit Sharma, the purple cap winner in the IPL is another bowler seeking an entry into the main team. It will be the first international experience for young Akshar Patel, and he will link up with Amit Mishra in the spin department.Bangladesh:While India have sent a largely experimental squad, the pressure will be truly on Mushfiqur Rahim and his Bangladesh team. Under fire for some poor performances, Bangladesh have had a poor year so far, and even lost to Afghanistan in the Asia Cup before being humbled by Hong Kong in the T20 Cup. There has been structural changes as well. Former Sri Lankan batsman, Chandrika Hathurasinghe replaced Shane Jurgensen as the coach of the national team. Known for his meticulous approach, Hathurasinghe will need to revive a fumbling unit ahead of the 2015 World Cup. Skipper Rahim has been a model of consistency, and Shakib Al Hasan has been in good touch in recent times. Tamim Iqbal is back after a long injury-enforced absence while Nasir Hossain and Mominul Haque have some competitive cricket under their belt, having been part of the 'A' team on the tour to West Indies.While the batting looks settled, there is plenty of promise in the bowling department - particularly Al Amin Hossain, who impressed the critics with his ability to procure pace and bounce. The selectors have also pinned plenty of hopes on young quickie, Taskin Ahmed. While the pacers look raw, there is plenty of depth and experience in the spin department. After a not too impressive performance in the recent past, Abdur Razzak and Sohag Gazi will look to bounce back in front of their home crowd.Stats and Trivia:With 206 ODI wickets, Abdur Razzak is clearly the most successful Bangladeshi bowler. However, his record against India is easily his worst. He has managed just 8 wickets from 11 games, at an unimpressive strike-rate of 69.37.Suresh Raina will be leading the Indian team for the third time. He has captained India in 9 matches previously, winning 4 matches and losing the remaining 5.Weather Conditions:Thunderstorms have been predicted on the Match-day. Wet weather has prevailed over the last couple of days as well.Teams:India (From): Robin Uthappa, Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina(c), Manoj Tiwary, Kedar Jadhav, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Parvez Rasool, Stuart Binny, Akshar Patel, Vinay Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Amit MishraBangladesh (From): Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Shamsur Rahman, Mominul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan, Nasir Hossain, Mithun Ali, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafe Mortaza, Sohag Gazi, Ziaur Rahman, Al-Amin Hossain, Taskin AhmedLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
