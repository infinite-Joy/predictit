For some reason, Zimbabwe opted to bat first in overcast conditions and paid the price immediately. Gul and Razzak made use of the conditions and made it 13-3 in no time. Taibu and Ervine batted sensibly for a while before Taibu departed trying to up the scoring rate. Ervine carried on in company of Lamb and skipper Chigumbura and reached a well made fifty. Zimbabwe lost Ervine soon after the rain break but Utseya and Chigumbura made sure there were no collapses.7:50 PM local time: Zimbabwe's innings is terminated, 162 from 38 overs is what the Pakistanis have to score. We will be back with the information regarding the powerplay overs.7:35 PM local time: The covers are totally removed now. Rameez Raja cuts to an ad break with another silly joke of his: We shall come back with an update if we get one.  Well, Mr. Rameez, if you guys don't get an update, who else will?Not the official news, but Rameez Raja says: According to D/L method, if the Pakistan innings starts at 8:30 PM, then Pakistan would chase 150 in 30 overs.7:30 PM local time: It has stopped raining, the covers are coming off one by one. The ground staff are doing a wonderful job. Good news folks, we will see some play sooner rather than later. Cut off time is 9:22 PM local time. The two umpires are out to inspect the conditions, the covers at the centre of the square haven't come out yet.

ZIMBABWE:15.6  Afridi to Ervine, no run, well outside the off stump, Ervine lets the keeper collect it
ZIMBABWE:15.5  Afridi to Ervine, no run, that's the wrong-un, the googly from Afridi that skids on, Ervine gets his bat down, prevents it from knocking the stumps, the ball was pitched outside leg, so the LBW was out of question
ZIMBABWE:15.4  Afridi to Lamb, 1 run, on the shorter side, Lamb cuts it to backward point, Hafeez dives to his left and throws it to the keeper, there was a slight misunderstanding between the two batsmen, but they make it safely in the end

ZIMBABWE:13.5  Razzaq to Lamb, no run, back of a length and angled across, left alone
ZIMBABWE:13.4  Razzaq to Ervine, 3 runs, Well, to be honest, that was comical stuff in the deep. Ervine did well to punch that between the two men at cover, Hafeez and Younis were the two, they gave it a chase and both slid to push the ball back, it was as if they were on some swimming drills, Hafeez dived a touch earlier but the duo save one run for their team

ZIMBABWE:12.4  Riaz to Taibu, out Caught by Afridi at mid off!! Afridi - safe hands! Taibu was looking to drive it on the up and go over mid off as he did a couple of overs ago, played away from the body, does not get the required elevation, Afridi runs to his left and takes a comfortable waist high catch, he doesn't drop many, does he? End of Taibu and Zimbabwe are 43/4. Taibu c Afridi b Riaz 19(29) [4s-2] Riaz to Taibu, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ZIMBABWE:11.6  Razzaq to Ervine, no run, catch dropped!! The disease looks to have spread from Kamran Akmal to the man next to him. Yes, believe it, it is Misbah-ul-Haq who drops one that was easier than what he took initially, Ervine gets an outside edge as Razzaq gets the ball to move across, Yes, the ball was dying down but it was catchable, he closed the palm even before the ball came to him, a lost opportunity!

ZIMBABWE:11.4  Razzaq to Ervine, no run, angled across the left hander, he draws his bat close to the body, watches the ball through to the keeper

ZIMBABWE:10.5  Riaz to Ervine, no run, angled into the pads of Ervine, he works it straight to the fielder at square leg, not the conventional square leg position that, the fielder was standing a bit forward

ZIMBABWE:10.1  Riaz to Taibu, no run, starts with a bouncer again, just chest high this time around, Taibu stands tall and defend
ZIMBABWE:9.6  Razzaq to Ervine, FOUR!!, that's as good an extra cover drive as you would ever see from a Zimbabwe batsman, nice stride forward, ensured that he got towards the pitch of the delivery and drove it elegantly past a diving fielder at short extra cover, he had no chance of stopping that, fine shot!
ZIMBABWE:9.5  Razzaq to Ervine, no run, back of a length stuff, around the middle and leg stump, Ervine goes back and taps it to the left of the bowler, the sun is coming out now, and batting looks a bit more easy
ZIMBABWE:9.4  Razzaq to Ervine, no run, well played again, it was pitched up and around the middle stump, defended down the wicket by Ervine

ZIMBABWE:9.1  Razzaq to Ervine, 1 run, not much movement on that one, perhaps it just straightened a tad, Ervine gets an inside edge as he looks to drive it through cover, the ball rolls towards fine legAbdul Razzaq [4.0-1-12-1] is back into the attack
ZIMBABWE:8.6  Riaz to Ervine, 3 runs, that's good running between the wickets, worked off his pads after getting across, gets it through mid wicket, the throw came to Afridi who was backing up at the bowler's end, Ervine had run three by then
ZIMBABWE:8.5  Riaz to Ervine, no run, back of a length and outside the off stump, Ervine punches it to point, straight to the fielder
ZIMBABWE:8.4  Riaz to Ervine, no run, he's keeping things tight, not drifting on either sides of the wicket, all that Ervine could do was defend it off the backfoot

ZIMBABWE:7.6  Gul to Taibu, 1 run, whipped wide of Razzaq at mid on, he does well to slide in time and prevent the ball from going past him, releases the ball quickly and that would only get Taibu a single
ZIMBABWE:7.5  Gul to Taibu, no run, Taibu gets behind the line of the one that was angling in, defends it to the on side towards short mid wicket
ZIMBABWE:7.4  Gul to Taibu, FOUR!!, Taibu is an experienced campaigner and they would need him to play well, gets forward and uses the width, slashes it through point and cover, didn't quite middle it as well as he would have wanted but four runs nevertheless
ZIMBABWE:7.3  Gul to Taibu, no run, banged in short this time around, Taibu does well to let it through to the keeper
ZIMBABWE:7.2  Gul to Taibu, no run, pitched up and the line being towards off and middle, pushed with the full face of the bat towards mid on
ZIMBABWE:7.1  Gul to Taibu, no run, How did that miss the outside edge? Gets the ball to bounce and move away after pitching it up, Taibu was pushing at it, the ball whistles past the outside edge of the bat, and Rameez Raja cooes on air: That had everything in it except the outside edge

ZIMBABWE:5.6 Gul to Ervine, no run, Do they go for a review? No, they don't. Straightens after pitching, rapped on the knee roll or thereabouts, may be the ball was sliding down the leg, the only thing that could have saved him on that occasion, pitching slightly outside leg also as shown by the hawk eye, the ball lobs up to Shahzad and he appeals for a catch, but the sound was of the bat was hitting the pad
ZIMBABWE:5.5  Gul to Ervine, no run, that's a typical fast bowler's comeback! bangs it short and follows Ervine getting it to jab back in, Ervine drops his wrists and sways back, Ervine almost lost his balance and fell over
ZIMBABWE:5.4  Gul to Ervine, FOUR!!, the idea was right from Gul to pitch it up and lure Ervine forward, but Ervine is too good for all that, drives it handsomely through cover, timed it to perfection and it was enough to take the ball to the boundary
ZIMBABWE:5.3  Gul to Ervine, no run, fuller and angling away from Ervine, he leans forward and shoulders armsCraig Ervine, left handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:5.2  Gul to Sibanda, out Caught by Misbah-ul-Haq at 1st slip!! That's the end of Sibanda, wonderful safe hands at first slip! He got the first one to come back in and gets this one to move away after pitching it just short of a good length, Sibanda was poking at it, gets a thick outside edge, the ball was flying quickly to the right of Misbah, he stretches both his hands and takes it cleanly, he's one of the safest fielders in the Pakistani camp. Sibanda c Misbah-ul-Haq b Gul 5(11) [4s-1] Gul to Sibanda, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:5.1  Gul to Sibanda, no run, probing line and length, lands on a good length and comes back in, Sibanda defends it, the ball hit the toe of the bat and almost rolled back onto the stumps

ZIMBABWE:3.4  Gul to Sibanda, no run, Gul comes back with a good bouncer, Sibanda ducks and lets it go
ZIMBABWE:3.3 Gul to Sibanda, FOUR!!, top shot! pitched up around the off stump, Sibanda opens the face of the bat and square drives it to perfection, now that's a way to ease the nerves, gets it between point and cover point, the outfield is quick and it will run all the way
ZIMBABWE:3.2  Gul to Sibanda, no run, full and angling in, targetting the stumps, Sibanda does well to get his bat down and keep it away, had he not done that, it would have been the end of him

ZIMBABWE:2.4  Razzaq to Sibanda, 1 run, loud appeal yet again, but on this occasion, there was an inside edge, sharp inward movement off the seam, Sibanda was looking to tuck it across, the inside edge saves him and they sneak a single as the ball moves towards square leg
ZIMBABWE:2.3  Razzaq to Sibanda, no run, the batsmen are not having it easy out there, another one that nips back in and raps Sibanda high on the pad, stifled appeal from Razzaq and Co. not given

ZIMBABWE:1.6  Gul to Chakabva, out Lbw!! Was it sliding down the leg? Looked so to the naked eye, or it might have probably clipped leg. But another superb delivery from Gul, got the ball to nip back in sharply after landing it just short of a good length, Chakabva was looking to clip it off his pads, he misses, rapped in front of middle and leg, umpire Llong raises his finger, it would have been worth a review. Chakabva lbw b Gul 0(6) Gul to Chakabva, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Chakabva has been given OUT and he does not take the review!
ZIMBABWE:1.5  Gul to Chakabva, no run, fuller one around the off and middle, Chakabva gets his front leg across and taps it to the on side

ZIMBABWE:1.2  Gul to Chakabva, no run, ripper! The ball comes back in this time off a length, moved after it passed Chakabva, Kamran Akmal initially moved the other way, but does well in the end to prevent the ball from running away, good wicket keeping that!
ZIMBABWE:1.1  Gul to Chakabva, no run, appreciable movement for Gul straight away, it was pitched up outside off, the ball bounced and nipped away off the seam, Chakabva shoulders arms, that would surely keep Gul interestedUmar Gul, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
ZIMBABWE:0.6  Razzaq to Taibu, no run, fuller one and angled in, Taibu leans nicely forward and taps it to the off sideTatenda Taibu, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:0.5  Razzaq to Taylor, out Caught by Kamran Akmal!! Omg! Is it Kamran Akmal? yes it is! That's one way to silence your cricics. Superb delivery from Razzaq, just got the short of a good length delivery to move away from Taylor, he was lured forward, the ball took the outside edge and went to the right of Kamran who pouches it safely, he has had a tough time of late, but that would surely give him some confidence. Taylor c Kamran Akmal b Razzaq 4(5) [4s-1] Razzaq to Taylor, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:0.4  Razzaq to Taylor, no run, loud appeal from Razzaq as the ball nips back in and raps Taylor on the pad just above the knee roll, looked close but the height was the question, not given, and soon after that delivery, all the Pakistani close in fielders walk towards Taylor to have a few words with him
ZIMBABWE:0.3  Razzaq to Taylor, FOUR!!, good way to get off the mark! It was back of a length and around the off stump, Taylor punched it off the backfoot through cover, Afridi tried giving it a chase, but the ball won the race, good shot that!

ZIMBABWE:0.2  Razzaq to Taylor, wide, a length ball to follow the fuller delivery but this time, the line goes wrong, well outside the off stump, the umpire calls it a wide
ZIMBABWE:0.1  Razzaq to Taylor, no run, a slight hint of away movement as Razzaq tried to angle that fuller delivery in towards Taylor, he uses his wrists drives it towards mid onTaylor and Chakabva are at the crease. Taylor is on strike. Razzaq will open the attackWell, looks like there is no time for anthems. Straight to business. The openers walk out, and I (Ajith) will take you through the first 15 overs. It will be interesting to see what the Pakistani bowlers get from the green wicket and the cloudy conditions.Alright, it's Bye Bye Rain for the moment. The players have walked out, there was an update from the ground a couple of minutes ago and it said, the anthems are cancelled due to the slight rain delay. But it looks like they have reversed that decsion of theirs, the players are warming up. There is still a bit of confusion, and more importantly Kamran Akmal is practicing his wicket keeping skills. The Pakistan team are in a huddle and the umpires finally make their way out.2:30 PM local time: The covers are removed now, the game will start in less than ten minutes.2:25 PM local time: There is a slight drizzle, the sun is playing hide and seek, The covers have been brought on. But it is looking like it would clear up quickly. As I type, the groundsmen start removing the covers.By the way, it's Elton Chigumbura's birthday today. A week ago, when Ross Taylor celebrated his birthday, he got a couple of nice gifts from Pakistan in general and Kamran Akmal in particular. Will it be the same today? Let's find out..Teams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Brendan Taylor, Regis Chakabva, Tatenda Taibu(w), Vusi Sibanda, Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura(c), Gregory Lamb, Prosper Utseya, Graeme Cremer, Shingirai Masakadza, Ray PricePakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Asad Shafiq, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Wahab Riaz, Umar GulZimbabwe have won the toss and elected to batAfridi: The conditions are good for bowling, the wicket is fresh, if the bowlers bowl in the right areas, we can get early wickets. Kamran Akmal has been working hard, he knows his mistakes and as a captain, I support him. Riaz and Shafiq are back in place of Akhtar and Umar Akmal.Chigumbura: We want to bat first, put runs on board and then try and defend it. We would play our best cricket.Pitch report: The wicket is hard, the grass is not even. There are patchy sections of grass, there will be some uneven bounce and sideways movement. The overcast conditions may force the captain to bowl first.Weather report:  Thunderstorms are predicted later in the day, there was a light shower in the morning, the covers were on half an hour ago. But, they have been removed now. The sun is out. Hopefully, it stays the same way.Umar Akmal, who was injured in the last game, may be given a rest. That's the info we have right now. Kamran Akmal has had a bad tournament with the gloves on, he needs to show more commitment behind the stumps. Wahab Riaz may play, says Wasim Akram.Younis Khan: As a batsman, you need to apply yourself, you need to spend time at the crease and get your eye in before going after the bowlers. Batting under lights is a little bit tricky, there will be seam and spin. The openers haven't played so well, and hopefully they will turn things around.Their form has dipped a wee bit in the recent past, but they still stand to be one of the favorites to win the Cup. They are the Men in Green from Pakistan, the unpredictables as we call them, and they face off against Zimbabwe at Pallekele, in one of the newly built lavishing grounds in Sri Lanka. A warm welcome to one and all. This is Ajith, I will bring you the action as and when it unfolds. I will be joined by Ganesh, Karthik and Srivathsa in a short while. Don't go away,we'll be back with more updates.The Preview by Vishaal LoganathanPakistan, along with Australia, looked to be the team to beat in group A after their impressive run of form, but a devastating attack from Ross Taylor left the team from Asia brutally exposed when under pressure and now the team look vulnerable. Zimbabwe on the other hand have not had much to write home about except the victory against Canada but to expect them to beat Pakistan would be asking too much of them. There have already been a couple of upsets in the World Cup so far, but it was all in Group B, Zimbabwe will look to start the trend in group A.Pakistan: Pakistan have been on and off in the World Cup so far, there are days they look unstoppable while they can also be close to appalling when its not their day which to be fair is what makes Pakistan so dangerous. Their batting relies heavily on the 3 middle order stalwarts. Misbah ul Haq, Younis Khan and Umar Akmal have often been called upon to rescue the team when in trouble, but with the younger Akmal suffering a slight niggle the batting looks a little frail. Shahid Afridi will have to step up and lead from the front the way he has done with the ball.
The bowling attack is among the most potent in the World Cup and with Afridi finishing form the attack could be too much to handle for Zimbabwe. They did receive a thrashing at the hands of New Zealand especially in the last few overs, but they would use the game against Zimbabwe to get their tournament back on track.Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe have been the most impressive team among the minnows in group A, but that would be little consolation for the once giant killers. With chances of making the quarters bleak Zimbabwe will at least hope to give a top team a run for their money before leaving.
They were walloped by Sri Lanka in their last game, with the Lankan openers piling on the runs in record breaking fashion. Zimbabwe too had a similar kind of start with Brendon Taylor looking in good touch, but the fall of the first wicket opened the flood gates and Sri Lanka mopped up the rest of the line in soon after. Zimbabwe will have to capitalize on any such start the openers provide.
Ray Price once again has a huge role to play if they are to try and restrict Pakistan to a low total. Chris Mpofu had a good outing against Lanka, picking up 4 wickets and Zimbabwe will want him to continue the good work.Head to head: Pakistan and Zimbabwe have played each other 40 times with the Asian country coming out on top on 36 occasions while there was 1 tie and 1 game yielded no result.QuotesZimbabwe coach, Alan Butcher: I think the concern is to put a positive total on the board and that's what's been our problem. I am happy with the way the team has performed in the field. Most of the time we have bowled well but haven't posted a good total. The minimum realistic target is 250 and if we score that then we have a chance against most teams
Shahid Afridi: He (Umar) is fit, it is a light injury. He fielded today and looked better, so definitely he will play tomorrow. Kamran's performance in batting hasn?t been bad but, yes, he is struggling with his keeping. He is working very hard, and we haven?t got such an option in the squad to whom we can give a chance in this tournament. Kamran has been working hard for four days. He has support and our confidence, he seems a better choice. I think he knows the mistakes he has committed and he will try to cover it for sure and will perform.Teams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Asad Shafiq, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Umar Akmal, Junaid KhanZimbabwe (From): Brendan Taylor, Regis Chakabva, Tatenda Taibu(w), Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura(c), Charles Coventry, Gregory Lamb, Prosper Utseya, Graeme Cremer, Ray Price, Chris Mpofu, Shingirai Masakadza, Tinashe Panyangara, Terry Duffin, Vusi SibandaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
