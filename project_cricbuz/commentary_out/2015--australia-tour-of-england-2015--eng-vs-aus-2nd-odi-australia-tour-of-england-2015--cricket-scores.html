Nasty bumper at 90mph, it's too quick for Morgan, who takes his eyes off the ball and tries to fend, the ball hits the glove and goes uppishly, rolls to backward square leg. A man at backward short leg would have swallowed itEoin Morgan, left handed bat, comes to the crease

Taylor tries to play across the line after taking a step down the track, the ball takes the leading edge and goes in the air towards cover, Burns moves to his right and just loses his footing as he tries to drive, hence he wasn't in a good position to take the catch and fingertipped it to sweeper cover

Full and outside off stump, Hales drives, but doesn't control it, hits it in the air, Smith flies full length to his right at short cover, goes with both hands and the ball sticks in his left hand.

Starc will open the attackWelcome back for the run chase.. Two slips in place for Starc.Under overcast conditions, England's pacers were disappointing as they didn't hit the right lengths. There was definitely enough seam movement on offer for the seamers early on in the innings. Chris Woakes was the only bowler on show who bowled with good control. Finn performed well in patches and picked up a couple of scalps. The track has kept the pacers interested and Moeen Ali extracted a bit of turn. However, if the home team's batsmen show good application against the new ball, they still can overhaul this target. Earlier, due to a persistent drizzle, it was reduced to 49-overs-per-side. Steven Smith, George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell cracked entertaining knocks to drive the tourists to a substantial total. In the slog overs, Shane Watson and Mitchell Marsh then played some power-packed strokes to up the ante. It was during Moeen Ali's 8th over that Watson and Marsh showed their class by clouting him for 19 runs. Both were timely knocks in the sense that Australia had just lost a bit of momentum after losing Maxwell's wicket. One has to also give credit to Smith and Bailey for setting up the platform after David Warner was hit on his left thumb by a short delivery from Steven Finn and had to retire hurt.Australia will be very happy with 309 on the board. Mitch Marsh's cameo has helped them get at least 10-15 runs extra than what they looked like getting at one stage.4

Maxwell thinks about the review but Watson nods suggesting that it was out and that was absolutely plumb in front. Umpire Kumar Dharmasena was quick to make the call. Big wicket for England as Maxwell was looking very good and now he falls one short of a fifty. Straight ball from Finn, pitched on a good length and heading towards the stumps, Maxwell went back and tried to flick, missed and the ball hit him in line with middle.

AUSTRALIA:22.3 Stokes to Bailey, no run, the crowd cheer on seeing Bailey flat-bat it straight to the fielder at mid-on. But this is a free-hit. Sat up to be hit as Stokes rolled his fingers over the ball, Bailey found Finn at the edge of the circle. The free-hit doesn't cost Stokes anythingAccording to the new regulations, the next delivery is a free-hit. Bailey needs a new bat. Slight delay. Morgan and Stokes have a chat about the field which can't be changed
AUSTRALIA:22.3 Stokes to Bailey, no ball, that has slipped out of Stokes' hands. Over the waist high full toss, Bailey was surprised as he spliced it to mid-on. Didn't carry to the fielder, looks like the bat is damaged. Bailey might need a new one

After Warner got retired hurt, getting hit on the thumb by Finn, Smith has played a chancy innings to get his side off to a decent start. He played and missed often but also took boundaries off Woakes when the seamer strayed onto the pads. Burns was looking good but he was bowled through the gate by Finn. Bailey has looked in good touch in his short stint so far
AUSTRALIA:16.6 Plunkett to Smith, no run, pitched up outside off, Smith's strong bottom-hand takes over as he looks to drive and the ball goes to mid-wicket off a thickish inside half. He isn't happy for not timing that. Looks like the ball stopped on Smith at the last moment

AUSTRALIA:14.3 Plunkett to Bailey, no run, loud shout for lbw but not given. They are pondering over a review and Morgan shakes his head. Nips back in down the slope, raps Bailey on the pads, the batsman is stuck on the crease and the ball hits Bailey above the kneeroll. Would've gone over

AUSTRALIA:13.1 Stokes to Smith, FOUR, poor delivery from Stokes, short and Smith gets inside the line to pull, beats fine leg easily who had too much room to coverWarner is seen going out for a net.

Two slips in place for Finn and Burns will be on strikeTeams:Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Joe Burns, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Shane Watson, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat CumminsEngland (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Steven FinnSmith: 'I would've bowled first as well. It was a good start to us for the series and hopefully we can continue playing some good cricket. It was very good with the way we came back, with the ball we didn't start off well. In the middle, we've to start getting partnerships in and hopefully we can do that.'Morgan: 'We are gonna have a bowl first. We are not going to see much sun today, best time to bowl today is hopefully early morning. Mark Wood is rested as he has had a heavy workload with the amount of bowling that he has done in the Ashes series and Liam Plunkett is in. Gives an opportunity for him to come in and show what he's made of. Unfortunately he got injured after the New Zealand series, it is good to have him back. We went with the best option today according to the coach and that is Liam. We are a long way away from being the finished article with both bat and ball. Our priority is to get our death bowling right - and series on series we will try to improve on that.'England have won the toss and have opted to fieldRevised playing conditions: Four bowlers can a bowl a max of 10 overs with one allowed to bowl 9. The last block of fielding restrictions will be from overs 40-4910:32 Local Time, 09:32 GMT, 15:02 IST: Toss will be at 11 and match will start at 1130. The sun is out and we have news that it is a 49 over game with a 30-minute innings break. The covers are off and the ground is dry and fine to play. Morgan and Hales have a look at the pitch while the others are loitering aroundGood news is that the rain has stopped and the tractor with a brush is sweeping the ground. That's how they do it here at the Home of Cricket. Innovative for sure. Warner is having a chat to someone from the Australian hierarchy. Smith sips on some drinks. Patience game but we should have some cricket pretty soonCricket Australia have tweeted that the toss has been delayed. No time on when it will happen. Meanwhile, the rain is easing off which is good newsUnfortunately, it has been raining since morning and the covers are in place. However, the weather is expected to improve as the day progresses. It is not all that heavy but it is a persistent drizzle. We might have a delayed start.On the other hand, there is a lot to cheer about for Australia. However, they would be slightly worried with some of their batsmen, including Steven Smith, David Warner and Joe Burns getting in and then getting out in Southampton. With England too playing an aggressive brand of cricket in recent times, it promises to be a cracker of a contest. Stay tuned for all the action coming your way.The home team would rue the fact that they couldn't capitalise on the brilliant start provided by Jason Roy and Alex Hales. England would also hope for the middle-order to stand up and be counted. Mark Wood was expensive in the first ODI and also struggled for his rhythm against New Zealand. England perhaps need to look at other options. David Willey, the all-rounder, might get a chance. Liam Plunkett and Reece Topley, who has been added to the squad, are the other two options they have in their ranks.Hello everyone. Welcome to our coverage of the 2nd ODI between England and Australia. The tourists showed why they are the current World Champions by overcoming England in the first game. Matthew Wade played a flurry of sparkling shots to lift Australia to a substantial total. The pacers then backed it up by bowling with unrelenting discipline to take Australia to a fine win.Preview:They may have just squandered the Ashes but Australia's supremacy of the 50-over format remains unparalleled. As Eoin Morgan's found out in Southampton, it took the world champions roughly 10 overs, in either innings, to turn the tide in their favour. England can ill afford to spend too much time in introspection of how the game got away from them at the Rose Bowl as they have less than 48 hours to prepare for the second ODI.While Australia return to London, the one city that bought them joy during their Ashes travails, with a hope of extending their dominance over England in the ODI format, the hosts realise that failure to bounce back at Lord's on Saturday would require them to win each of the remaining three games to win the series. However, if recent performances (against New Zealand) serve any indication, the 'new' England side is well endowed with resources to feel optimistic about forging a comeback.Date: September 5, 2015Time: 09:30 GMT; 15:00 ISTVenue: Lord's, LondonWeather: Mostly cloudy with a 10% chance of light showers in the afternoonTeam News:EnglandEngland's batting order certainly felt the pinch of Joe Root's absence in Southampton. Alex Hales, Jason Roy and James Taylor all got starts but in the face of the new fielding rules and some disciplined middle-overs bowling, failed to keep the scoreboard ticking. As Morgan opined in his post-match presser, such games were going to be crucial for England's growth as an ODI nation. The team management will also want to address the bowling, which despite having Australia on the mat at 193 for six, allowed them to score in excess of 300. They could consider bringing in left-arm medium pacer David Willey to give the bowling attack some variety. However, the performance of leggie Adil Rashid, 4 for 59, should hold England in good stead.Probable XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan (c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes/David Willey, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Steven FinnAustraliaMatthew Wade, one of the four changes to the side from the one that took the field for the World Cup final, with his rearguard rescue act exemplified whyAustraliahave been so successful in the ODIs. Even at 193 for six, they have the resolve and the depth in batting to get to competitive totals.The team management are unlikely to tamper with the teamcompositionunless the authorities at Lord's serve up a dry surface in which caseAustralia might bring on Ashton Agar.Probable XI: David Warner, Joe Burns, Steven Smith (c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Shane Watson, Matthew Wade (wk), Mitchell Marsh, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Mitchell Starc, Pat CumminsStats and Trivia:- Australia have won 10 of their last 11 ODIs against England- England last played an ODI at Lord's in May 2014 when a Jos Buttler scored a superb 121 in a losing cause against Sri LankaQuotes:"We can certainly improve. We are a long way off the world's best at the moment"- Eoin Morgan believes England are an improved ODI side but have a long way to go to challenge Australia."In any series, to start with a win is important but coming off the Ashes, this was more important."- Matthew Wade on the importance of momentum in a five-match ODI series.Teams:Australia (From): David Warner, Joe Burns, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Shane Watson, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Marsh, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Coulter-Nile, James Pattinson, Marcus Stoinis, Ashton AgarEngland (From): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Steven Finn, Liam Plunkett, David Willey, Sam BillingsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
