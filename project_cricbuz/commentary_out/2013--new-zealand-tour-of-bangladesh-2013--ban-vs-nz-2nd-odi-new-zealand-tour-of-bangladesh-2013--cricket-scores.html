So it will be interesting to see how they go about this run chase.....New Zealand came back well to bowl the hosts out before 50 overs. Bangladesh got off to a good start with Tamim scoring his 25th fifty. He was well supported by Shamsur and Mominul, who got starts before throwing it away. Most of the batsmen got starts but did not convert it into a big score. The New Zealand bowlers did well in the middle overs to keeping taking wickets. Anderson was the pick of the bowlers and was well supported by Neesham who picked up another 4-wicket haul. Now it is upto their batsmen to keep the series alive. Join us in a few minutes for the run chase.....4

The hosts put up an excellent performance to win the first match and go 1-0 up in the series. New Zealand started well with three quick wickets but could not break the partnership between Mushfiqur Rahim and Naeem Islam which was worth 154. They were always under pressure while chasing after the overs were reduced to 33 due to rain. Today they are without their in-form batsman Williamson, who flew back home with a fractured right thumb. Rubel Hossain was the star with the ball for Bangladesh as he picked up his career best figures of 6 for 26 which also included a hat-trick. Toss and teams in a few minutes....PreviewBangladesh will be looking to wrap up another ODI series victory over New Zealand when the two sides clash in the second ODI on Thursday. Rubel Hossain was the man of the moment for the hosts, taking a hat-trick after the rain break to ensure the Kiwis had no chance of staging a comeback.New Zealand were further jolted when Kane Williamson had to return home in the middle of the series, leaving an already week batting line-up far more vulnerable. The bowling (except Tim Southee in the first ODI, which they lost by 43 runs, looked ordinary and Brendon McCullum will expect a much better show on Thursday.Bangladesh skipper Mushfiqur Rahim, who led from the front with a splendid 90, did suggest that the ODI whitewash of 2010 would play on the visitors' minds and judging by the way they caved in on Tuesday, it looks like the Black Caps are still haunted by those defeats.Inexperienced as it may be, New Zealand still have serious firepower in their batting line-up with the likes of McCullum and Ross Taylor. If these two can get going, Bangladesh could be staring down the barrel.The hosts have done well to draw the Tests and win the first game, thanks to some brilliant individual shows. They are clicking well as a unit at least in their own conditions and now look favourites in the series. With a lot at stake today, both teams would be expected to go hard at each other.Teams:New Zealand (From): Hamish Rutherford, Anton Devcich, Grant Elliott, Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, Brendon McCullum(w/c), Jimmy Neesham, Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Tom Latham, Kyle Mills, Adam Milne, Colin MunroBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Naeem Islam, Nasir Hossain, Mahmudullah, Sohag Gazi, Mashrafe Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Al-Amin Hossain, Shakib Al Hasan, Shamsur Rahman, Ziaur RahmanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
