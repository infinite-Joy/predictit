We have to do well today. Rugby is a favourite back home. Good luck to the All Blacks. We will win this game first and watch that one.Pitch report: The wicket is hard. There is a green tinge in some areas. There will be some moisture because of a slight drizzle yesterday.New Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(w), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor(c), Kane Williamson, Jacob Oram, James Franklin, BJ Watling, Rob Nicol, Doug Bracewell, Andy McKay, G AldridgeZimbabwe (Playing XI): Vusi Sibanda, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(c), Malcolm Waller, Tatenda Taibu(w), Forster Mutizwa, Elton Chigumbura, Prosper Utseya, Ray Price, Chris Mpofu, Keegan MethNew Zealand have won the toss and elected to fieldThings have looked far from rosy for Zimbabwe. After a fine start to their comeback beating Bangladesh, things have started to go hopelessly wrong. They were pummeled by Pakistan and have hardly troubled New Zealand. There were some bright spots with captain Taylor scoring a superlative ton in the 1st ODI, but they need much more to stay alive. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates..Preview by Ganesh CZimbabwe have plunged once more after a good series against Bangladesh. The hammering at the hands of Pakistan seems to have dented their confidence. The Kiwis have done well to be ruthless so far in the two T20s and the ODI. They will be keen to wrap up the series with a win in the second game. It seems likely too unless Zimbabwe find some inspiration from somewhere.Zimbabwe:Brendan Taylor produced a superb ton in the first ODI but his team mates failed to lift their game as their captain had done. The innings came under tremendous pressure after the now familiar top order collapse from Zimbabwe. He produced one of his best efforts to keep Zimbabwe in the game until New Zealand's turn to bat. Zimbabwe are yet to master the art of building partnerships. One wicket almost always leads to one or two more in quick succession. Such mini collapses prevent Zimbabwe from grabbing the initiative. Despite the fine efforts from Forster Muritzwa and Taylor, Zimbabwe were always catching up. Building good stands should be the priority of the batsmen if they are to move forward as a team.The bowling was an even bigger let down and has been Zimbabwe's bane in this series. Raymond Price has been economical but he is not the type of bowler who will rip through the batting order. To his credit, the veteran did keep things tight at his end but all his efforts were negated by the free flow of runs at the other end. Containing the run flow will lead to wickets and Zimbabwe would do well to execute this is as a group.New Zealand:New Zealand has had it easy so far in this series. The top order is in prime form and are cashing in on a toothless attack. Their only test will come if Zimbabwe price out some quick wickets early in the innings. The middle order could be caught napping. Ross Taylor, the new captain, will be eager to get an opportunity to make some relatively easy runs. The bowlers let Zimbabwe off the hook after reducing them to 21/4. This could be a cause of concern for Ross Taylor and the bowlers themselves and they will be eager to get it right this time. New Zealand should ensure that they do not lift their foot off the pedal as yet. The team management will be keeping the players on their toes until they win the game and the series with that.Bottomline:New Zealand's biggest worry going into the game will not be the opposition. It will be complacency and if they guard against it, the series shall be won with this game.
