The players will be out soon as the innings was completed well before the stipulated close time. Stay tuned!South Africa were brilliant with the ball. Philander got the ball to move both ways early on and picked up three wickets. Steyn was in on the act, he scalped two and reached 150 wickets in ODIs. However, it was Imran Tahir who was the pick of the bowlers. The wily leg-spinner picked up four wickets and bamboozled the batsmen with his variation.This is the third lowest score at Buffalo Park and second lowest for West Indies against South Africa. It was a poor performance with the bat from West Indies, that is putting it mildly. Smith got a peach at the start, but apart from that, there were some reckless shots played by the batsmen. Gayle chased a wide one, Samuels miscued Tahir and Russell was the worst among all. He went for a wild slog and lost his leg stump.

M Morkel will open the attackThe national anthems are done and the South African players are taking their places. The West Indian openers are walking out to the middle. Morne Morkel will start proceedings. Two slips to assist him. Here we go with the first delivery...Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Narsingh Deonarine, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Jonathan Carter, Andre Russell, Carlos Brathwaite, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Sulieman BennSouth Africa (Playing XI): Rilee Rossouw, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(w/c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Morne MorkelTwo changes for West Indies - Narsingh Deonarine replaces Leon Johnson while  Carlos Brathwaite will be playing in place of Darren Sammy. South Africa are unchanged.West Indies have won the toss and have opted to batWest Indies have plenty of work to do, if they have to stay alive in the series. Chris Gayle has not yet fired in the ODIs, even though he was in-form in the T20Is. Marlon Samuels keeps getting starts, but has not yet turned it into a substantial score. Denesh Ramdin scored a fifty in the previous game and Jonathan Carter gave him good support, but it was not good enough to get them to the target. Will they make any changes to their team? Can they stop South Africa from taking an unassailable 3-0 lead? Hello and welcome to the third ODI at Buffalo Park. Stay tuned as the toss and teams are not far away....It was not all about ABD though, Hashim Amla and Rilee Rossouw scored their respective tons as well. The pair were involved in a 247-run opening stand. The three batsmen helped Proteas get their highest ODI total - 439 . The bowlers then made sure that the West Indian batsmen don't get anywhere close to the target. Dale Steyn was the pick, on a flat wicket the fast bowler ended with figures of 1/29 in his 10 overs.AB de Villiers just took the game away from West Indies in the second ODI at the Wanderers. The South African captain scored the fastest ODI hundred off 31 balls. He beat the previous best by Corey Anderson which came off 36 balls. On the way to his 149, he set numerous other records. The knock was so special that even a brutal batsman like Chris Gayle bowed down to ABD once the innings was over.Preview:West Indies were swept away by an AB de Villiers' special on Sunday when the South African star hammered the fastest ODI century in history to help the hosts take a 2-0 series lead at the Wanderers in Johannesburg. That historic knock left the Caribbean side bewildered and searching for answers to make a comeback in the five-match series. The third ODI in East London presents them with a chance to redeem themselves and stop the hosts from taking the series.For South Africa, a series win will be the perfect opportunity for them to search for consistency ahead of the World Cup and finding their perfect combination. With the top order in red-hot form, they will once again hope to bat the West Indies out of the game. With the pitch at Buffalo Park slated to be slower as compared to that at the Wanderers, the bowlers will come into picture and it could all boil down to who makes it tougher for the opposition batsmen to score.South AfricaAB de Villiers and his team will aim to seal the series before tinkering with their playing XI. Kyle Abbott, Aaron Phangiso and Wayne Parnell, all part of the World Cup side, are yet to play a game in the series and they may have to wait once more before getting some international exposure before next month's mega event. One area that has not been fully tested for South Africa is their lower middle order with players like JP Duminy, David Miller and Farhaan Behardien not getting a decent hit in the middle. On the bowling front, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander have been incisive enough and that has not allowed any pressure on Imran Tahir.West IndiesThe slower nature of the pitch at Buffalo Park gives the West Indies a chance to make an impact with the ball and come up with an improved performance. Sheldon Cottrell could find his way into the team after Jerome Taylor went for plenty in the de Villiers' carnage. All the bowlers, including captain Jason Holder will have to bring their A game in order to challenge a marauding South Africa. Chris Gayle, who is without an ODI hundred since the last 14 games, could provide that catalyst with an inspirational show. Lendl Simmons could replace Leon Johnson in the top three provided he is fit. Seniors like Dwayne Smith and Marlon Samuels will eye a big knock.StatsSouth Africa have won 12 out of 16 ODIs in East London. West Indies have lost their only ODI at Buffalo Park, by 43 runs in 1999.Teams:West Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Leon Johnson, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Jonathan Carter, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Sulieman Benn, Jerome Taylor, Narsingh Deonarine, Lendl Simmons, Sheldon Cottrell, Carlos BrathwaiteSouth Africa (From): Rilee Rossouw, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c/w), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Phangiso, Kyle Abbott, Morne van WykLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
