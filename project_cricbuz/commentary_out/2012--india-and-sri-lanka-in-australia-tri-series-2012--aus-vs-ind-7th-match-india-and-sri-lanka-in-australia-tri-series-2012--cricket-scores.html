David Huss guides this one to third man, Umesh gets there quickly and throws it flat and straight to Dhoni, Forrest was looking to make it 2 and had to recover, Dhoni was in front of the stumps and didn't realise that there was a run out chance, it was too late by the time he realised!

And very well bowled too, the back of hand slower ball which Hussey fails to spot, he charges down and plays the slog too early, mishits it STRAIGHT to deep mid wicket where Raina didn't move an inch. Excellent knock from Hussey ends, and another dangerous Hussey comes in. Michael Hussey c Raina b Irfan Pathan 59(52) [4s-6] Irfan Pathan to Michael Hussey, THATS OUT!!

AUSTRALIA:41.6  Raina to Michael Hussey, FOUR, 5000 ODI runs for Hussey, and he gets there with a bit of a gift from his CSK team-mate. Down the leg side and he just glances it past short fine leg, the costly last over has also spoilt Raina's figures.. he was very good in his previous spells. This is the first time he has finished his quota of 10 overs in an ODI too

AUSTRALIA:40.1  Irfan Pathan to Forrest, FOUR, gentle short ball to start, and Forrest smashes it over mid wicket. Poor bowling this.. needs to be fuller and a bit more quickerThat ends Zaheer's spell. He looks a bit tired, and has his hands on his knees. Billy Bowden too crouches and has a few words with Zak.. 37 runs came from the batting powerplay. Once again an unofficial drinks break..Irfan Pathan [5.0-0-23-1] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:39.6  Zaheer to Forrest, 1 run, fullish ball on the legs, Forrest drills it to long on, retains strike with a single
AUSTRALIA:39.5  Zaheer to Michael Hussey, 1 run, direct hit would have dismissed Hussey! Jadeja missed it by a few inches there! Mistimes this pull to mid wicket and starts running, Jadeja charges in, picks up the ball and releases it quickly.. would have been out despite the dive.

AUSTRALIA:38.3  Umesh Yadav to Michael Hussey, FOUR, poor. Very very poor from Umesh. Why do they bowl short to this man? I just can't understad. But Hussey's pulls are a treat to watch, gets it in the air and wide of deep square leg for another boundary
AUSTRALIA:38.2  Umesh Yadav to Michael Hussey, no run, ooh.. a full toss, Hussey was surprised by that and just defended it, a bit more high and it would have been a no ball for height
AUSTRALIA:38.1  Umesh Yadav to Michael Hussey, FOUR, fine leg is inside the circle and Umesh gives Hussey more reasons to smile. Strays on the pads and Hussey says thank you buddy and glances it awayUmesh Yadav [4.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:37.6  Zaheer to Forrest, no run, excellent finish to the over, a slow bouncer angled across the right hander, he had no clue about that one and just let it go through.. Forrest is really struggling

AUSTRALIA:37.1  Zaheer to Michael Hussey, no run, tight stuff on the off, Hussey defends it from the creaseThe over-rate has been pretty poor. And for those who are wondering, Sachin Tendulkar can come out to open the batting (or play at any other position) despite being off the field for a long time, because he injured himself on the field.
AUSTRALIA:36.6  Vinay Kumar to Forrest, no run, full and straight, Forrest stays in the crease and pushes it back to the bowler

He dismissed a well set Mahela Jayawardene in the previous game, in the batting powerplay. Can he do it again here? Uh oh, he aborts his run up as he runs in. Looks like he has injured himself here. Some problem with his toes? Or cramps? Looks like it is the latter. The physio is out there in the middle now. He seems to be fine, has a smile on his face and the ball in his hands. Back to action!
AUSTRALIA:35.6  Zaheer to Michael Hussey, no run, beats his bat, that's good bowling. Full again but gets it to move away a touch, Hussey looks to drive through covers but is beaten by the movement

AUSTRALIA:35.4  Zaheer to Michael Hussey, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, Hussey stays back and cuts it to third man for oneBy the way, Tendulkar is still off the field. He looked to be in a lot of pain when he walked out.. will he bat? Remember, no runners allowed these days..

AUSTRALIA:33.1  Umesh Yadav to Michael Hussey, 2 runs, good length and on the middle and leg, Mike goes on the backfoot and punches it to deep mid wicket region for a coupleAmidst all the controversy about the "wrong button" being pressed, I must say that Hussey stumping appeal was a bit closer than it seemed. Stump cam showed that the boot was on the line, but the third umpire didn't see enough replays. Wrong button, and wrong decision!Umesh Yadav [3.0-0-17-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:32.6  Raina to Forrest, 2 runs, good running! Punches this off the backfoot to long on, calls early for 2 and Hussey is too quick between the wickets

AUSTRALIA:31.5  Rohit Sharma to Forrest, 1 run, flicks it to mid wicket for a single
AUSTRALIA:31.4  Rohit Sharma to Michael Hussey, 1 run, missed run out chance?! In fact Forrest was not even in the frame! Dhoni the culprit. Hussey defends it straight to point and starts off, Raina is quick as usual and lets the ball go in a flash, Dhoni was trying to deflect it onto the stumps instead of the normal pick up and whip the bail stuff.. that has proved costly!
AUSTRALIA:31.3  Rohit Sharma to Forrest, 1 run, too full and too straight, Forrest flicks it to deep mid wicket, they want 2 but Vinay is quick there
AUSTRALIA:31.2  Rohit Sharma to Michael Hussey, 1 run, slow and straight, Hussey works it to square leg for a single
AUSTRALIA:31.1  Rohit Sharma to Forrest, 1 run, tossed up on the off, Forrest uses his feet and gets a thich outside edge to sweeper cover, he was trying to play through the on side thereThe players have now stopped for some refreshments. So a break after a bit of controversy there. Bruce Oxenford was the third umpire, and he was involved in the 2008 Sydney match between India and Australia.. funny how controversies follow him too! Billy Bowden did well to defuse the tension, but must say I've never seen Dhoni so angry!

AUSTRALIA:28.3  Raina to Michael Hussey, no run, the third umpire seems to have pressed the wrong button. He first signalled out but the on field umpires called Hussey back. Dhoni seemed to be pretty unhappy about it. It was a flighted delivery outside off stump, Michael Hussey went forward to defend the delivery but gets beaten outside the off stump, Dhoni takes the bails off in a flash but replays aren't too conclusive and the third umpire eventually says it isn't outThere's an appeal for a stumping here against Michael Hussey, it has gone up to the third umpire. Replays show that the foot is on the line, really tough for the umpire this one

Flighted on middle and off, Wade gets beaten by the flight and gets into his shot too early as he tries to drive it past the bowler.

Zaheer Khan replaces Ashwin. Sehwag has not recovered from the back spasms.Ponting: We will bat first. The conditions changed quickly at the SCG and we misread the pitch. It is not an easy ground to chase on. We have faced some tough conditions and we were not good enough. Clint McKay is ill and Hilfenhaus comes back in. It has been a long time since he played an ODI.Australia have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: Ravi Shastri reckons that it is a typical Gabba pitch. It is hard and firm, rock hard in fact. There is whitish tinge on this wicket and there is a sprinkling of grass. The conditions are humid and the ball will swing around. The team that wins the toss should bat first.The big question for India is, who will be rested today? Sehwag is still not available and there are reports that Gautam Gambhir could be warming the bench as per the rotation policy.The conditions are a bit cloudy and humid at the Gabba. This is a great venue for India in ODIs. In the last three completed ODIs, they have won all three.The CB series is poised at a very interesting stage. With Sri Lanka's victory against Australia at Sydney, the whole competition has been thrown open. The focus shifts to Brisbane where Australia take on India. This is a must win game for Australia to regain confidence as they have lost two consecutive games. For India, they have finally come back into form on this tour and they will look to continue their good run.Preview by SrivathsaThere is a very famous adage in English which people almost wait to use in opportune moments:- 'What goes around, comes around'. In a summer where they thrashed India 4-0 in the Test series and their old war-horse Ricky Ponting stuck gold with batting form, Australia have gone from 'the celebrated' to the brink of 'the humiliated'. Their sojourn in the shorter formats of the game started with a win in the T20 and ODI tri-series against India and they even managed to beat Sri Lanka in the second ODI. But that was a couple of weeks back. In the meantime, the skipper Michael Clarke injured himself, Ponting came in to lead the side and they had to bear the brunt of a dejected coach who blasted the side for their consecutive losses. They will be looking to arrest the slide against an Indian side, which is not at it's best, but has given itself a shot in the arm with a slew of compact performances. It will be interesting to see which of the two teams will take the initiative to dominate:- Speaking with respect to behaviour, Australia are known to be aggressive no matter what, but India surely have the edge. IndiaIndia have done extremely well so far in the CB series after a disastrous test series, which saw them being humiliated. They stand at the top of the table after the halfway stage of the tournament and that is due to some excellent all-round performances. The return to form of Gambhir is a very good sign and down the order, there is 'Captain Cool' - MS Dhoni who is proving himself to be the best finisher in the ODI game at this moment. Even though they have looked like the best side in the competition, India would want to finish off games more clinically. The last game against Sri Lanka is a perfect example ? they were cruising at one stage and then allowed the Lankans to come back. Good teams rarely let the opposition of the hook and that's what India have to aim to do. Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma need some runs under their belt, especially the former who is going through a lean run at the moment.With India looking to rotate the three openers, it wouldn't be a surprise if Sachin Tendulkar is given the day off at Brisbane. If that happens, then Sehwag will come back in and he too needs to put his head down and try for a big score ? which has been eluding him this entire series. The bowling looks very balanced and with Irfan Pathan batting at 8, the depth of this Indian side is something to marvel at. India know a victory on Sunday, will take them a step closer to their first target ? which is to reach the finals. For that to happen, they need to put in a disciplined effort on a track which is expected to be pacy.AustraliaIt started so well for the hosts, but the last couple of games have seen them being very ordinary. The injury to Michael Clarke has come at the wrong time and they were humiliated by Sri Lanka in a rain affected game the other day. Australia's batting was looking very suspect before the start of the tournament and it has been proved to be their bug-bear. Ricky Ponting hasn't looked like the Ponting who made huge scores in the test series. Even a promotion as opener in one of the games didn't help. He is under huge pressure and captaincy has added to his headaches. With Clarke not available on Sunday, it is imperative for Ponting to get a big score and if he does, then that confidence will automatically filter into his captaincy which can only prove to be beneficial for Australia.Matthew Wade is another who has flopped miserably with the bat in the series, with Warner proving to be hit and miss the opening combination have failed in every game which has put the already brittle middle order under more strife. Peter Forrest who made his debut looks a very powerful player and is a player in the Shane Watson mould ? strong square of the wicket and good straight down the ground. Without Clarke's calm presence in the middle order, it is up to the likes of Mike Hussey to shore up the innings and then provide the late impetus. Clint McKay may have conceded the 13 runs in the last over to give India an unlikely victory, but he certainly has looked the best Aussie bowler on view. His back of the hand slower balls have troubled everyone and has mixed up his variations pretty well. Doherty too has applied the breaks during the middle overs and has provided a perfect partner for McKay. With Brisbane expected to help the seamers, Australia would look to go all-out to secure a win which will put them back on track.Quotable QuotesThe guys are hurting and this is an opportunity for them to atone for what happened last night.
