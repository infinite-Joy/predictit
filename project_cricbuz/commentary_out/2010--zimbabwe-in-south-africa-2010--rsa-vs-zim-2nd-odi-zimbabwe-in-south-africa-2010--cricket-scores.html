SOUTH AFRICA:0.1  Utseya to Amla, 1 run, quicker one to start with, Amla works it to mid wicket and he's off the mark straight awayAmla and Smith are at the crease. Amla is on strike. Utseya will open the attackWelcome back. A few quick wickets will put Zim right on top while a good 50 odd run stand first up will give South Africa the edge. The boys from Zimbabwe are in a huddle as the batsmen make their way out.Most of the Zim batsmen got starts but none of them managed to capitalise and go on to make a big one. Taibu was the star with the bat for Zim, he scored quick runs and got past his 15th ODI fifty. SA bowlers varied the pace quite well and caused some problems for the batsmen on a flat deck. SA hold the upper hand at halfway stage. Theron was brilliant with the ball, he picked up a five wicket haul to bowl Zimbabwe out within the 50 overs. Do join us at 5:40 PM IST for the Protea reply.4

Despite putting on brave performances, Zimbabwe have not been able to win a match on this tour. This is Ajith and I will bring you all the action as and when it unfolds. Stay tuned for the toss and the team line ups..Preview by Siddharth VishwanathanIf one has observed the pattern in the T20s and the ODI which have taken place on this South African tour, one will see that Zimbabwe are playing determined cricket. Inspite of the fact that results have gone against them, they have given the South Africans some nervous moments in each and every match. Both teams are equally matched with the bat, while South Africa have a slight edge in the bowling. However, looking at the amount of runs scored so far on this tour, one may find it hard to point out which attack is better.South Africa took up the opportunity to introduce some fresh faces in the squad for this ODI series. Juan Theron and Colin Ingram had built a formidable reputation in the T20 format and both were given their chance to showcase their skills at Bloemfontein. Both proved that they were ready for the big stage as Colin Ingram became the first South African to score an ODI century on debut. His 136 run stand with Hashim Amla gave the Proteas the launchpad for a big score. Amla scored a glorious ton as he got his summer of to a great start. Things got only better for the South Africans as David Miller came lower down the order and struck a rapid 50 to take South Africa past 350. This batting exhibition would have pleased skipper Graeme Smith as he has more options to explore ahead of the crucial series against India in December.Brendan Taylor was the star of the show as he gave Zimbabwe an outside chance for victory. His 145 was glorious and it underlined his importance to this inexperienced team. The rest of the batting line-up failed to support Taylor and they landed up 64 run shy of the target. Many Zimbabweans had their hopes pinned on Grant Flower, one of the many stars who had served the team well in he past. He was making a comeback into the national team after six years and all felt that he could prove to be an inspiration for this young side. However, he failed to get going and was out for 13. It was a spirited performance from the team after that but it could have been better had they managed to string some crucial partnerships. Zimbabwe would want to rectify their inability to build partnerships in the very next game if they have to challenge South Africa.The bowling department from both teams leaked runs aplenty in the previous match. It was more surprising in the case of South Africa as they had the experience of Albie Morkel, Charl Langeveldt and Wayne Parnell in their pace attack. The rustiness was evident in the Proteas bowling as most of them conceded more than five runs an over. 'Rusty' Theron, on his debut, gave away runs but came back well in the death overs as he enhanced his credibility of being the 'Best death overs bowler' for South Africa by picking up three wickets. Only Johan Botha was the star as he bowled a tight and economic spell to build up pressure on the Zimbabwe batsmen. However, both teams need to put in a better performance with the ball, more so with the case of South Africa as they aim to build up confidence ahead of a tough and gruelling summer.Zimbabwe's bowlers looked the least threatening in this game. Shingirai Masakadza was the pick of the bowlers with four wickets but his economy rate was 8.6. All the bowlers wilted under the onslaught, with only their fielders salvaging some pride for them with a good fielding performance. The medium pacers and the spinners struggled to control the run flow as the South Africans batted exceptionally against them. Cremer and Utseya, two spinners, who did well recently, were taken to the cleaners. It was the inability to control the runs in the middle overs by the slow bowlers which hurt the team.The second ODI is played at Potchefstroom, another ground which is a batting paradise. Zimbabwe will be hoping that their luck changes at this venue as they try to put in a much better performance, but South Africa look clear favourties to clinch the series and get their summer of to a great start.Numbers game: 10: Number of years since Zimbabwe last defeated South Africa in an ODI. The last time they defeated the Proteas was in 2000 at Durban in a tri-series featuring England. They won the match of the last ball with 2 wickets remaining.9: Brendan Taylor became only the 9th player in ODIs to carry his bat right through the innings.Teams:South Africa (From): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Johan Botha, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, Jacques Kallis, Charl Langeveldt, David Miller, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Juan Theron, Lonwabo TsotsobeZimbabwe (From): Elton Chigumbura(c), Chamu Chibhabha, Graeme Cremer, Keith Dabengwa, Craig Ervine, Grant Flower, Hamilton Masakadza, Shingirai Masakadza, Chris Mpofu, Ian Nicolson, Ed Rainsford, Tatenda Taibu(w), Brendan Taylor, Prosper Utseya, Sean WilliamsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
