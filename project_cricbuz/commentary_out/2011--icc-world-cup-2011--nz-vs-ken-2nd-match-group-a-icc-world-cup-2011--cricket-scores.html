We had a good bunch of players and we really did well in that edition. I am looking forward to playing this game as well as the others. Watching all the senior Kenyan players during the last 10 years has given me a lot of confidence.Brendon McCullum: Our confidence is building up. We have to put behind those tough defeats and concentrate on the job. We are all hoping to make a sizeable impact in this tournament. There has been a lot of build-up prior to the tournament and it is great to be part of such a big event.Vettori:The wicket is expected to deteriorate later. Mills misses out due to a back injury he suffered in the warm-up games. We have had prior experience on playing this pitch and that will help us as the match goes on.Kamande: It looks a good pitch to bat and we would like to put some runs on the board. I am happy with the way we performed in the warm-up matches.Kenya have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: Robin Jackman reckons the pitch is dry and has no grass at all and it will mostly assist the spinners. He feels it's a win the toss, bat first pitch.Hello and Welcome to day 2 of the 2011 World Cup. After a spectacular opening at Mirpur where India thrashed Bangladesh, the action now shifts to Chennai where New Zealand take on Kenya. The Kiwis have not had a good time in their recent tour to the subcontinent, having being roundly thrashed by Bangladesh and India. They will be desperate to put their poor record behind and get off to a winning start. Kenya, on the other hand, will be looking to cause an upset. Stay tuned for all the live updates, toss and team news.by Vishaal Loganathan:The format of the 2011 World Cup means the league phase will be thickly populated by established teams taking on minnows, and the second match of the event is one such. However, the established team involved - New Zealand - have had a rough time of it in international cricket in the past few months, while the minnows - Kenya - have a history of causing upsets in the World Cup.Team News:New Zealand: New Zealand have had more than their share of a taste of the sub continent in the past few months: they played Bangladesh in a 5 match series, then came to India for 5 more before going to back to play 7 ODIs against Pakistan. The series should have helped the Kiwis get a fair view of the conditions and the kind of players likely to come up against in the World Cup but the series against the two teams turned out to be a harsh reality check.
The horrible slump in form put NZ in need of some serious soul searching ahead of the World Cup. The Kiwis will look to erase these painful memories and get their act together when they take on lowly Kenya in their opening match of the World Cup.
To say that their batting in recent times has been lacklustre would be a huge understatement. The New Zealand batting, especially from the middle order, has been pathetic. Martin Guptill, at the top of the order, has been one of the very few batsmen to be amongst the runs and they have often had the lower order to thank for their gritty performances.Kenya: Kenya have hardly had anything to make the world stand up and take notice since their surprise rise to the semi-finals in the 2003 edition and that will be something they will take inspiration from. Another foray into the semis looks highly unlikely given that this year's tournament format favours the top teams. However, that will not stop them from trying to upset a few apple-carts along the way, as they did so memorably against the West Indies in 1996, when the World Cup was last held in the subcontinent.
Kenya's main weapon would be the element of surprise. The Black Caps would have hardly seen, let alone play against, the Kenyan side. They can also take heart from the fact that New Zealand's performances of late have been bad, and this would be the ideal chance for them to start off with a bang.Captain's speak:New Zealand: Daniel Vettori said the team was looking at the World Cup to get a fresh start. "We lost a lot of games in recent times and they were disappointing performances, particularly in the sub-continent, but I hope we can look at the World Cup as a fresh start. We are sure to up our confidence levels."Kenya: The African side seem upbeat about their chances to cause an upset. Skipper Jimmy Kamande said: "We have improved our batting and on the bowling side, we are coming together. We want to play to our potential and allow the result to take care of itself. We are going to play our brand of cricket that we know best. We are geared up to get good results."Head to head:Matches: 2
