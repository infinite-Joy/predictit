PAKISTAN:32.5 S Raza to Shafiq, no run, tossed up and Shafiq is comfortable to forward defend that to the right of the bowler
PAKISTAN:32.4 S Raza to Shafiq, no run, floated up outside off, Shafiq for some strange reason allows the ball to go through to the keeper, could've cut that away, but left it alone
PAKISTAN:32.3 S Raza to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, very full on the stumps, Shoaib Malik gets forward and drives to long-on

PAKISTAN:31.6 M Waller to Shoaib Malik, no run, turns in and cramps Shoaib Malik for room, he mistimes the cut to cover and is disappointed with himself for not putting that away. Walks away expressing his emotion
PAKISTAN:31.5 M Waller to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, Shoaib Malik is finishing this off very quickly. Dragged down short and outside off, Malik rocked back and played a vertical bat slap wide of mid-off, who didn't dive, should've and escorted the ball to the fence.

PAKISTAN:30.6 Luke Jongwe to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, length ball on middle and leg, Shoaib Malik lifts one leg up in the air and then plays a pick-up pull to the deep fine leg fence, looked stylish when he played that and also good use of the wrists to keep the shot down. Beat the fielder in the deep easily
PAKISTAN:30.5 Luke Jongwe to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, Shoaib Malik has had enough of prodding and pushing. Takes a step forward and then slams the pull over mid-wicket, it was just a back of a length delivery outside off and Shoaib Malik took full toll off it. Another boundary to him and the target is just down to 17

PAKISTAN:30.3 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, 1 run, good length outside off, Shafiq presses it off the front foot to mid-off, quick single taken
PAKISTAN:30.2 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, FOUR, deftly done! Down leg, Shafiq needed to get bat on the shot and did so, glancing it off his hips to the fine leg fence. The fielder was way too square to have any chance of cutting that off
PAKISTAN:30.1 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, nips back in and raps Shafiq on the shuffle, too high to entertain a shout for lbw
PAKISTAN:29.6 Mutombodzi to Shafiq, 1 run, tossed up and Shafiq gets forward to push past Mutombodzi's dive to his left, single taken
PAKISTAN:29.5 Mutombodzi to Shafiq, no run, now Raza does well to save runs, moves to his right and dives to cut off the strong cut from Shafiq
PAKISTAN:29.4 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, leg byes, 1 run, down leg, Shoaib Malik fails to glance and they take a leg-bye as the ball runs away off the pad
PAKISTAN:29.3 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, no run, flighted delivery outside off, Shoaib Malik pushes it gently to cover
PAKISTAN:29.2 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, SIX, that is so bad that Shoaib Malik could've slept for a second, woken up and then slam it for six - which he did eventually. Real drag-down delivery, Shoaib Malik had to wait for an age and then did well to rock back and muscle the pull wide of long-on, carried all the way, waited till the last moment and had the patience to clear the fence
PAKISTAN:29.1 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, no run, tossed up outside off, Shoaib Malik gets forward and defends to the right of the bowler
PAKISTAN:28.6 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, Shafiq is in no hurry whatsoever. Quite prepared to respect the good length deliveries and offer a 180-degree bat
PAKISTAN:28.5 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, gently flicked away to short mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:28.4 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, back of a length short of length angling in on the hips, Shafiq misses out on his flick and wears it on the thigh pad
PAKISTAN:28.3 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, 2 runs, low full toss angling in on the pads, flicked away behind square. The ball rolls away wide of fine leg who sprints across the circumference to cut it out
PAKISTAN:28.2 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, pitched up around off stump, gently driven down to mid-off
PAKISTAN:28.1 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, a good length off-cutter on off, Shafiq presents a water-tight front foot defence
PAKISTAN:27.6 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, loopy delivery which lands very full on off, Malik clears his front leg and lifts it with the turn over extra-cover
PAKISTAN:27.5 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, no run, seems like a decent shout for LBW. The ball has just pitched outside leg. Drifting in nicely around leg and turns, Malik is hit on the pad first in his front foot defence
PAKISTAN:27.4 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, no run, flattish, shortish delivery on the stumps, it stayed quite low on this occasion. Malik was looking to punch it hard through the off-side but gets a thick inside edge back towards the bowler
PAKISTAN:27.3 Mutombodzi to Shafiq, 1 run, well flighted delivery turning away from off, pushed with the turn to sweeper cover
PAKISTAN:27.2 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, another real shocker, but this time he gets away. Half-tracker on the stumps, Malik once again looks for a similar pull but this time sends it a lot squarer. Bounces in front of a chasing deep backward square leg
PAKISTAN:27.1 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, Mutombodzi doesn't seem to be learning. He got away with a couple of shockers in his first over. Not this time. A real long-hop on middle, Malik jumps back in the crease and hammers the pull over mid-wicketAn extended drinks break as Malik had gone back perhaps to take a leak..Drinks are on the field now!
PAKISTAN:26.6 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, hops to ride the bounce on this short of length delivery outside off, fends it into the off-side with soft hands
PAKISTAN:26.5 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, Jongwe might have rolled his fingers across the ball this time. A fuller length leg-cutter on middle, Shafiq was looking to flick it away but the ball pitches and holds its line.
PAKISTAN:26.4 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, on a length on middle, no problems for Shafiq who is impenetrable in his front foot defence
PAKISTAN:26.3 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, 2 runs, slightly fuller than the previous delivery, flicked to the right of mid wicket, the fielder dives over the ball - a clumsy effort. Another easy couple on offer
PAKISTAN:26.2 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, 2 runs, angling into the pads on a good length, Shafiq nudges it through the square leg region and the call is for two straightaway. The deep backward square leg has a lot of ground to make and the batsmen end up jogging back
PAKISTAN:26.1 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, pitched right up on off and middle, gently on-driven to mid-on
PAKISTAN:25.6 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, no run, shortish delivery outside off, stayed a touch low due to which Malik ends up chopping his cut into the off-side
PAKISTAN:25.5 Mutombodzi to Shafiq, 1 run, flatter on off, whipped wide of mid-on, the fielder gives chase and keeps the batsmen to a single
PAKISTAN:25.4 Mutombodzi to Shafiq, no run, this one comes out of the hand much better. Well flighted delivery turning away on a length across off, Shafiq plays it with the turn to cover
PAKISTAN:25.3 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, and now drags this one short, again gets away with it. Malik jumps back in the crease, crunches the pull but again to that man in covering the mid-wicket fence
PAKISTAN:25.2 Mutombodzi to Shafiq, 1 run, a friendly loopy full toss on the stumps, Shafiq belts it along the turf and straight to deep mid-wicket, the bowler must thank his stars
PAKISTAN:25.1 Mutombodzi to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, a floated up leg-break on middle, Malik gently flicks it behind square on the on-side, the batsmen push for the second run but decide against itTinotenda Mutombodzi, right-arm leg break, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:24.6 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, this slightly back of a length delivery has been defended from the crease

PAKISTAN:24.3 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, 1 run, on a length on middle, Shafiq closes the bat face on impact and directs the ball wide of square leg to collect the run
PAKISTAN:24.2 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, 2 runs, Shafiq is a lucky man. The ball had popped in the air but just wide of the man at short mid-wicket. A back of a length delivery which stops on Shafiq as he was looking to clip it away. The leading edge leaves the fielder wrong footed. Might have been out of his reach as well
PAKISTAN:24.1 Luke Jongwe to Shafiq, no run, overpitched on middle, Shafiq plays a nice looking on-drive but straight to mid-on
PAKISTAN:23.6 Sean Williams to Shoaib Malik, no run, nicely tossed up on a length just outside off, Malik is drawn forward into the cover-drive but gets nowhere close to the pitch of the ball because of the dip, gets it off a thickish outside edge towards cover-point, all along the ground though

PAKISTAN:23.2 Sean Williams to Ahmed Shehzad, out Stumped!! A glimmer of hope for Zimbabwe may be? They absolutely needed this. Beautifully bowled from Williams as well. Gave it a nice rip. Well flighted delivery drifting in around off, Shehzad is lulled out of his crease but the ball dips on him as he looks to flick it through the on-side. Then bites off the pitch and spins past the outside edge. He is left stranded and the keeper has an easy stumping to effect. Ahmed Shehzad st Chari b Sean Williams 32(61) [4s-2]Sean Williams to Ahmed Shehzad, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!
PAKISTAN:23.1 Sean Williams to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, shortish outside off, Shehzad misses out as he finds cover-point with his cut
PAKISTAN:22.6 Luke Jongwe to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, dabbed down to third man
PAKISTAN:22.5 Luke Jongwe to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, 'if it's in my arc I'll have a swipe', seems to be the thinking now. Fraction fuller than a good length just outside off, Shehzad looks for an ugly heave, only manages an outside edge which flies through the vacant slip region to the third man fence
PAKISTAN:22.4 Luke Jongwe to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, on a length in the channel outside off, Shehzad is unflustered in defence
PAKISTAN:22.3 Luke Jongwe to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, pitched up around off, Shehzad drives straight to cover
PAKISTAN:22.2 Luke Jongwe to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, just short of length delivery around the fifth stump line, Shehzad swats the pull to short mid-wicket who collects and shies at the non-striker's end. This time Shafiq has his wits about him
PAKISTAN:22.1 Luke Jongwe to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, Shafiq was nearly halfway down looking for a single, sent back just in time to beat the throw. On a length and on the pads, Shehzad clips it straight to square leg. Not sure what the non-striker was thinkingLuke Jongwe [2.0-0-14-0] is back into the attackThe duo have consolidated well after the two quick wickets. Will we see a gallop to the finish line?

PAKISTAN:21.5 Sean Williams to Shafiq, no run, fired in flat and kept low too, Shafiq went back to pull and missed, way down leg and that's why there was no appeal except for the over-enthusiastic Chari who belted out one

PAKISTAN:21.3 Sean Williams to Shafiq, no run, rocks back and punches, finds extra cover

PAKISTAN:20.5 Panyangara to Shafiq, 3 runs, nicely punched off the back foot wide of short cover, two they take and by the time the the throw from mid-off comes in, it is a bad one, on the bounce in front of the keeper who can't gather it cleanly. They take another one. Sloppy stuff from the hosts

PAKISTAN:19.5 Sean Williams to Shafiq, FOUR, this time Shafiq makes Sean Williams pay for bowling short and wide outside off, he cuts and beats cover's dive to his right. Raza gave chase from extra-cover but the ball was always winnging the race. Placed the shot well between the two fielders, did Shafiq
PAKISTAN:19.4 Sean Williams to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, Ahmed Shehzad uses his feet and then gently nudges it into the gap at short mid-wicket for a single

PAKISTAN:12.5 John Nyumbu to Hafeez, FOUR, nothing risky about that stroke. Trademark Hafeez. He plays the late-cuts better than anyone else in the game currently. This was angled across him, he went back in a flash and played the shot wide of backward point. Finesse and connection made at the right time to get the placement right. Eye-pleasing stroke from the Professor
PAKISTAN:12.4 John Nyumbu to Hafeez, FOUR, 'catch, catch' was the cry from the keeper. But Hafeez gets away. He gets too close to the pitch of the ball but manages to loft over mid-off's head. A flat hit and he gets off the mark in a risky way

He wanted to keep the assault on John Nyumbu going but his lofted shot is caught with two hands on the run by the fielder. Anticipated the shot and moved before catching it while he was airborne. Once he fell, he had the control over the ball. That is superb from the youngster and the wicket Zimbabwe needed to get some momentum going their way.

PAKISTAN:11.4 Sean Williams to Ahmed Shehzad, FOUR, Ahmed Shehzad pre-meditated that but got it on the full and swept it away to the deep backward square fence, no-one there and that is a pressure-releasing boundary for Ahmed Shehzad who was getting bogged down of late

PAKISTAN:10.5 John Nyumbu to Bilal Asif, SIX, forget about this one. It is in orbit over cow corner. Well flighted delivery on the stumps, Asif needs no second invitation. He is down the track in a jiffy and whacks it with the turn. Clears the ropes

PAKISTAN:8.4 John Nyumbu to Bilal Asif, wide, a real shocker from the offie. Dragged down well short and down leg, Asif looks to muscle the pull away but misses. Must be cursing himself
PAKISTAN:8.3 John Nyumbu to Bilal Asif, no run, a lot more air given on this fullish delivery around off, a nice solid front foot defence from Asif

The equation is simple for the visitors: 133 runs needed with a required rate of close to 3 an over. Simple enough? Hang on guys, it's Pakistan.State: Lunch breakEarlier in the day, Zimbabwe collapsed from 89-0 to 161 all-out due to inept, mindless and silly batting. The batsmen didn't have a clue against spin and Bilal Asif helped himself to a five-for. Wasim took three and Zimbabwe capitulated spectacularly. Things looked so rosy when the openers were going strong but their dismissals set off a chain reaction. We will be back soon to wind up the remainder of the match. Do stay tuned...Pakistan have had no trouble in the seven overs. Zimbabwe had a chance to get Bilal Asif out but Nyumbu shelled a regulation catch at slip in Jongwe's first over. Sean Williams in the same over tried his best to get to a skier but it was more of half-a-chance rather than anything else. Asif wants to play his strokes and enjoy himself while Shehzad is circumspect at the other end. The pitch is flat and it will need a Zimbabwe-like collapse from the visitors to throw the series away

PAKISTAN:4.5 Panyangara to Bilal Asif, no run, slower delivery on the stumps, Bilal Asif is early into the drive, is lucky that the inside edge onto pad doesn't roll back onto the stumps. Dribbles wide of leg stump and he manages a wry smile
PAKISTAN:4.4 Panyangara to Bilal Asif, FOUR, looks like Bilal Asif wants to end this quickly. Short on the stumps, he swivels and pulls over deep backward square leg, one bounce over the ropes. Fine stroke

PAKISTAN:3.5 Luke Jongwe to Bilal Asif, FOUR, if the last four was all power, this is all finesse and class from Bilal Asif. Pitched up outside off and swinging away, Bilal Asif gets forward and leans on the stroke, opens the face of the bat to square drive wide of the diving backward point. Raced away
PAKISTAN:3.4 Luke Jongwe to Bilal Asif, FOUR, when it is pitched up, Bilal Asif goes after it. Full outside off, Bilal Asif gets forward and lofts hard and wide of mid-off. Even before Luke Jongwe could get his hands out in an attempt to catch that, the ball had flown past him
PAKISTAN:3.3 Luke Jongwe to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, full on the stumps, flicked past mid-wicket's dive and they take a single before mid-on gets across
PAKISTAN:3.2 Luke Jongwe to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, loose from Ahmed Shehzad. Full outside off, Ahmed Shehzad played outside the line in trying to drive and is beaten on the inside edge. Lavish that from Shehzad. The keeper who is Chari fumbles. No edge on that one though

PAKISTAN:1.6 Luke Jongwe to Bilal Asif, no run, good length outside off, Bilal Asif shuffles across and defends it back to the bowler
PAKISTAN:1.5 Luke Jongwe to Bilal Asif, FOUR, now a half-a-chance goes abegging at third man. Full marks to Sean Williams though for trying to catch that on the run, he went for the catch and didn't worry about saving the boundary which many would've gone for. That's how you win matches of cricket - playing aggressive cricket and trying to win. This was full outside off, Bilal Asif threw the kitchen sink at that and the thick outside edge was never carrying to Williams, who ran all the way and then dived forward, the ball lands in front of him, eludes the hands and rushes away to the fence. Didn't even get a hand on it in the end
PAKISTAN:1.4 Luke Jongwe to Bilal Asif, no run, back of a length outside off, tapped to point from the crease
PAKISTAN:1.3 Luke Jongwe to Bilal Asif, no run, now safely shoulders arms to a full ball outside off

PAKISTAN:0.1 Panyangara to Ahmed Shehzad, 1 run, he is off the mark first ball, on middle, clipped to fine leg, for a singleAhmed Shehzad and Bilal Asif are at the crease. Ahmed Shehzad is on strike. Panyangara will open the attackWelcome back... Pakistan will bat for 30 minutes before we have a lunch break or whatever they are going to eat. Panyangara will start with a lone slip in place. Shehzad the man on strikeWhile Mutumbami and Chibhabha were going, it all seemed hunky dory. The duo were quite prepared to bide their time early on and play themselves in. The pacers were seen off with no damage done. But their dismissals set off a brainfade. The innings break is just 10 minutes. In fact, the Pakistani openers are making their way out as I type this.. So no respite for us.What a stunning collapse. Oh Zimbabwe, you have let one slip here (not saying Pakistan will certainly get the runs). The position they were in after 20 overs, it's very hard to end up with what they have even if you try to. But full credit to that man - Bilal Asif. He ran riot and crippled the home team. Was certainly aided by some inept batting. The pitch is no big turner, I can tell you. Just that the Zimbabwean batsmen failed to apply themselves. A mental block perhaps?3
ZIMBABWE:38.5 Shoaib Malik to John Nyumbu, out Caught by Rizwan!! A stunning catch to cap off a superb effort in the field. Total commitment from Rizwan at backward square leg. Zimbabwe have been wrapped up for 161 after an 89-run opening stand. Coming to the wicket, Nyumbu had pre-meditated the paddled sweep, Malik bowled it slower through the air on the stumps, seems to have been early into the shot and got it off the toe-end. The ball lobs for a while and was wide of the fielder, Rizwan sprints across and puts in a full length dive with both hands. Pouches it inches off the turf.

ZIMBABWE:36.5 Irfan to Luke Jongwe, no run, a bumper on the stumps, Jongwe ducks under it easily
ZIMBABWE:36.4 Irfan to Luke Jongwe, 2 runs, Jongwe sees this one pitched in his half and his eyes light up. Fuller length delivery just outside off, Jongwe takes a stride down looking to launch it straight. Slices the shot on impact but just about clears a backtracking mid-off
ZIMBABWE:36.3 Irfan to Luke Jongwe, no run, on a length in the channel outside off, Jongwe steers it to point

ZIMBABWE:36.1 Irfan to Luke Jongwe, FOUR, short, wide and cut away hard through the point region. Was too bad a delivery to cause even a tailender like Jongwe any troubles
ZIMBABWE:35.6 Imad Wasim to John Nyumbu, no run, fired in on middle, Nyumbu does well to get his front pad out of the way and defend
ZIMBABWE:35.5 Imad Wasim to John Nyumbu, no run, pushed through the air quicker just outside off, Nyumbu tries to cut but the ball was too close to the body to be playing that shot. He is beaten by the pace as well and fails to lay any bat
ZIMBABWE:35.4 Imad Wasim to John Nyumbu, no run, flatter delivery around off, Nyumbu punches it to coverJohn Nyumbu, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:35.3 Imad Wasim to Panyangara, out Lbw!! If there was some doubt with the previous one, there is absolutely none about this. Another arm-ball, this time much straighter, don't know what Panyangara was doing trying to play the dab. Would have been a surprise had he connected. The ball stays a touch low as well beating the inside edge and thudding onto the back pad. The impact is in front of middle. Panyangara lbw b Imad Wasim 0(2)Imad Wasim to Panyangara, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
ZIMBABWE:35.2 Imad Wasim to Panyangara, no run, so close to get another. Huge shot for LBW but might have been sliding down leg. The arm ball pitching on middle, Panyangara plays for some turn in his front foot defence and is beaten on the inside edgeTinashe Panyangara, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:35.1 Imad Wasim to M Waller, out Caught by Hafeez!! The pattern of soft dismissals is never ending. Waller is the latest on the list. It was a floated up delivery on the stumps, Waller plays the flick well in front of his body and just ends up chipping it in the air, straight into the lap of mid-wicket who dives forward to take a low catch. M Waller c Hafeez b Imad Wasim 8(15) [4s-1]Imad Wasim to M Waller, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Imad Wasim [6.0-0-31-1] is back into the attack
ZIMBABWE:34.6 Irfan to M Waller, 1 run, low full toss from round the wicket outside off, Waller times the drive well but cover-point dives to cut it out. Rifles in a direct-hit at the non-striker's end and the batsmen collect an overthrow off the deflection
ZIMBABWE:34.5 Irfan to M Waller, FOUR, that is some shot. On the rise and against a bowler like Irfan. Fraction fuller than a good length just outside off, Waller presses forward and plays the lofted straight drive through the line and straight of mid-off, might have gone over him as well
ZIMBABWE:34.5 Irfan to M Waller, wide, well wide of off and angling further away, no chance of indecision from the ump who signals a wide straightaway
ZIMBABWE:34.4 Irfan to M Waller, no run, on a length around the fifth stump line, Waller gently pushes it towards cover-point on the rise
ZIMBABWE:34.3 Irfan to M Waller, no run, these Pakistani left-armers are a menace for the tail-end for any team. The disconcerting bounce they generate. Phew! Lifts from a back of a length beating the outside edge of Waller's attempted punch
ZIMBABWE:34.2 Irfan to M Waller, no run, angling away wide of off on a fuller length, Waller lets it go through to the keeper
ZIMBABWE:34.1 Irfan to M Waller, no run, on a back of a length around the fifth stump line, Waller rises on his toes and gently punches it to the right of backward point, Shehzad sprints across and puts in the dive to cut the single
ZIMBABWE:33.6 Riaz to M Waller, 1 run, a nice confident steer down to third man means that Waller will keep the strike, not sure he wants it though
ZIMBABWE:33.5 Riaz to M Waller, no run, just short of length in the channel outside off, Waller waits on the back foot and directs the ball towards backward point with an open face. The fielder unnecesarily shies at the striker's end but FSL is there to back up
ZIMBABWE:33.4 Riaz to Luke Jongwe, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, gently cut away behind backward point and down to third man
ZIMBABWE:33.3 Riaz to Luke Jongwe, no run, a short of length delivery on the stumps, didn't quite rise as much as Jongwe expected while ducking, clips his back on the way to the keeper
ZIMBABWE:33.2 Riaz to Luke Jongwe, 2 runs, overpitched delivery outside off, good stuff from Jongwe getting forward and drives it through the cover region. That's the end of anything full I reckon
ZIMBABWE:33.1 Riaz to M Waller, 1 run, on a length in the channel outside off, Waller pushes it through the coversWhat an astonishing downhill turn after the solid show from the openers. That's been the trouble plaguing Zimbabwe like forever. Can't kick on from a good start
ZIMBABWE:32.6 Irfan to Luke Jongwe, no run, on a length around middle, Jongwe offers a defensive blade off the front footLuke Jongwe, right handed bat, comes to the creaseDrinks are on the field now!
ZIMBABWE:32.5 Irfan to Mutumbami, out Caught by Sarfraz Ahmed!! The final nail in Zimbabwe's coffin? We'll find that out. But a big blow nonetheless. The well set Mutumbami trudges back to the hut. A short of length delivery angling away well wide of off, Mutumbami tries to fetch the pull from there - might have been better off looking to cut or upper-cut - the ball keeps lifting and gets too big on him in the end. Only manages a top edge through to the keeper who can't get an easier one. Mutumbami c Sarfraz Ahmed b Irfan 67(85) [4s-5 6s-2]Irfan to Mutumbami, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:32.4 Irfan to Mutumbami, no run, another occasion where the ball doesn't quite get up. On a back of a length angling away outside off, Mutumbami tries to wood-pecker it with an open face but is late to get the bat down. The ball stays low and sneaks under the toe-end
ZIMBABWE:32.3 Irfan to Mutumbami, no run, slightly fuller than a back of a length around the fifth stump line, Mutumbami steers it to backward point
ZIMBABWE:32.2 Irfan to Mutumbami, 2 runs, where's the slip when you need it? A genuine outside edge beats the keeper's dive and the ball rolls to third man. Mutumbami was looking to guide this back of a length delivery to third man but is done in by the angle and the extra bounce
ZIMBABWE:32.1 Irfan to Mutumbami, no run, the ball lifts sharply off a short of length and is angling well wide of off. Mutumbami tries to reach out with an upper cut but fails to lay any batMohammad Irfan [5.0-0-27-0] is back into the attack
ZIMBABWE:31.6 Riaz to M Waller, no run, yes, the bumper. It's too high though and down the leg side as well, Waller gets underneath it easily enough. The umpire sides with the bowler this time and his arms remain tucked close to his bodyThe leg gully moves to backward short leg. Any guesses what's to come next?
ZIMBABWE:31.5 Riaz to M Waller, no run, on a back of a length and into the body, Waller looks to fend it off but wears it flush on the glove. The ball pops up but wide of the FSL fielderA short leg, leg gully and a slip in place
ZIMBABWE:31.4 Riaz to Mutumbami, 1 run, that safety won't last long as Mutumbami opens the face of his bat and runs this good length delivery down to third man
ZIMBABWE:31.3 Riaz to M Waller, 1 run, Waller isn't going to get anything in his half it looks like. Another one banged in on a back of a length around middle, Waller awkwardly clips it behind square and gets to the safety of the other end
ZIMBABWE:31.3 Riaz to M Waller, wide, errs in line this time with his short of length delivery, down the leg side and Waller moves inside the line
ZIMBABWE:31.2 Riaz to M Waller, no run, a short of length delivery which lifts off the surface surprising Waller, he fails to get his glove out of the firing line in time. Luckily the ball dies on its way to backward point
ZIMBABWE:31.1 Riaz to Mutumbami, 1 run, Mutumbami steers this good length delivery down to third man
ZIMBABWE:30.6 Bilal Asif to M Waller, no run, the top-spinner which was well flighted around off, Waller lunges forward to get close to the pitch and blocksMalcolm Waller, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:30.5 Bilal Asif to Mutombodzi, out Bowled!! It's all going haywire for the hosts. Six wickets in a span of around 11 overs. This delivery was pushed through the air and turning back in on off, Mutombodzi goes leg side trying to manufacture a cut but is cramped for room as the ball turns back sharply. Might have just chopped it on the stumps off the inside edge. Bilal can do no wrong. He is off doing the 'Sajda' before being mobbed by his teammates. Mutombodzi b Bilal Asif 4(9)Bilal Asif to Mutombodzi, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
ZIMBABWE:30.4 Bilal Asif to Mutombodzi, no run, nicely tossed up around off, Mutombodzi pushes it to cover

ZIMBABWE:30.2 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, no run, well flighted delivery on off, Mutumbami lunges forward and blocks
ZIMBABWE:30.1 Bilal Asif to Mutombodzi, 1 run, this was ever so close to the bowler, in fact Bilal got fingertips to it on his dive. Well flighted delivery around off, Mutombodzi is drawn out of his crease in looking to work through the on-side, closes the bat face early and the leading edge scoops to the right of the bowler
ZIMBABWE:29.6 Riaz to Mutombodzi, 1 run, nicely played. Dabs it wide of backward point and takes the quick single on offer
ZIMBABWE:29.5 Riaz to Mutombodzi, no run, full outside off, Mutombodzi is tentative and isn't sure which way the ball is moving around, pokes limply in an attempt to get bat on the shot and is well beaten againNow a slip in for Mutombodzi

ZIMBABWE:29.3 Riaz to Mutumbami, no run, Mutumbami is miles late on the attempted dab. Pacy length ball outside off, Mutumbami wants to run it down and is nowhere near getting bat on that
ZIMBABWE:29.2 Riaz to Mutumbami, no run, full outside off, Mutumbami wants to drive on the rise, but the ball stops and catches the bat splice to roll to short cover
ZIMBABWE:29.1 Riaz to Mutombodzi, 1 run, full outside off, Mutombodzi leans forward tentatively to push and the inside edge runs wide of the stumps. Got a bit lucky thereWahab Riaz [3.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack

ZIMBABWE:28.3 Bilal Asif to S Raza, out Bowled!! Another bad shot and Bilal Asif has his fourth wicket. He runs with his arms stretched wide in joy. Can't quite believe his luck. Raza got well outside the line of the ball to sweep, but the ball was bowled slower and beat his attempted shot, then went through the gap to disturb the stumps. There was a huge gap for the ball to go through and it did. Zimbabwe now facing a battle to post a challenging score. Replays show that he lost balance while attempting a shot and went one-handed with the sweep. The bottom hand came off the bat handle. S Raza b Bilal Asif 2(6)Bilal Asif to S Raza, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
ZIMBABWE:28.2 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, 1 run, flighted delivery outside off, Mutumbami takes it from there and slogs to deep mid-wicket

ZIMBABWE:27.2 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, fired in on off and middle, pushed to the right of the bowler
ZIMBABWE:27.1 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, SIX, cracking blow by Mutumbami. He isn't bothered with the wickets falling at the other end. Tossed up on middle, Mutumbami clears his front leg and then slog-sweeps it flat over deep mid-wicket, lots of power behind the shot and it goes a long way over the ropes. Cracking shot that
ZIMBABWE:26.6 Bilal Asif to S Raza, no run, Raza uses his feet and since he isn't to the pitch of the ball, gently turns it in front of leg-slipSlip and a leg-slip in place now for the new batsmanSikandar Raza, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:26.5 Bilal Asif to Chigumbura, out Bowled!! Bilal Asif is on a roll. Nothing shot from Chigumbura. Very tentative from the Zimbabwean skipper. He was stuck on the crease and was very unsure as to what to do with that ball that turned in, the ball goes off the face of the defending blade and went onto to fall on the stumps. Pakistan are cock-a-hoop and understandly so. Chigumbura b Bilal Asif 0(2)Bilal Asif to Chigumbura, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
ZIMBABWE:26.4 Bilal Asif to Chigumbura, no run, Chigumbura had a big stride forward to that tossed up delivery outside off, in the end he defends tot he left of the bowlerElton Chigumbura, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:26.3 Bilal Asif to Sean Williams, out Caught&Bowled!! Second wicket for Bilal Asif and guess what, the second caught and bowled today. Again the Zimbabwean batsmen making the mistake of playing across the line of the turning ball, very full around off, Sean Williams gets forward and wants to flick through mid-wicket, the bat face closes on impact and the leading edge carries nicely back to the bowler. Easy catch and suddenly the hosts have lost the plot in the middle overs. Sean Williams c and b Bilal Asif 5(6) [4s-1]Bilal Asif to Sean Williams, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!

Gets forward and flays it wide of the cover fielder, diving to his right, long-off moves to his left to cut it off. A raise of the bat and that will be it for the moment. He knows he has to kick on
ZIMBABWE:25.3 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, skids on outside off, quicker too, Mutumbami mistimes the cut to cover
ZIMBABWE:25.2 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, fired down leg, Mutumbami kneels down to sweep and misses, struck in-line with leg and would've gone down - that's why there was no real appeal for lbw
ZIMBABWE:25.1 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, tossed up outside off, driven straight to the fielder at cover
ZIMBABWE:24.6 Bilal Asif to Sean Williams, FOUR, beautiful shot from Sean Williams. He skips down the track and then makes room to loft the offie over mid-on, one bounce over the ropes. Was cleanly struck and almost went all the way. Good calculated blow that
ZIMBABWE:24.5 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, 1 run, gets forward and drives to long-on for a single
ZIMBABWE:24.4 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, no run, comes down the track and flicks to mid-wicket, Ahmed Shehzad dives to his right and fumbles, that should've been stopped but he concedes the single
ZIMBABWE:24.3 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, no run, slight leading edge on the flick, but the ball was never in catching range as it dribbles to mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:24.2 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, no run, wants to come forward but then allows the ball to turn in, plays it behind square with a closed bat face
ZIMBABWE:24.1 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, no run, tossed up outside off, Mutumbami lunges forward to block it back to the bowler
ZIMBABWE:23.6 Imad Wasim to Sean Williams, no run, Sean Williams got outside the line of the ball and missed the sweep, a mild appeal dies down as the Pakistanis know that Sean Williams was struck outside the line as he went to play the paddle
ZIMBABWE:23.5 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, 1 run, sliding into the pads, clipped through square leg
ZIMBABWE:23.4 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, flat and on off and middle, respected with a defenceSarfraz is a nuisance for the batsmen behind the stumps. Constant chatter in Urdu and annoying at times
ZIMBABWE:23.3 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, fired in on middle, flicked to mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:23.2 Imad Wasim to Sean Williams, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Sean Williams kneels down and paddles it to deep backward square leg, off the mark with that single first ballSean Williams, left handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:23.1 Imad Wasim to Chari, out Lbw!! Plumb! That is not the way to play the left-arm spinner. The arm-ball consumes Chari. He didn't pick it off the hand or the pitch, played back and the ball skidded on rapidly to strike him on the pad in front of middle and leg. Easy call and Sarfraz knew it straightaway, he just started walking towards the bowler to celebrate even as he was appealing. Chari lbw b Imad Wasim 4(8)Imad Wasim to Chari, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Imad Wasim [3.0-0-18-0] is back into the attack
ZIMBABWE:22.6 Bilal Asif to Chari, 1 run, Bilal Asif is bowling with a nice loop and flight, the ball dips on Chari's attempted flick but he manages a single to deep square leg

ZIMBABWE:22.2 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, no run, tossed up outside off, turned gently towards short mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:22.1 Bilal Asif to Chari, 1 run, pre-meditated paddle and Chari nearly doesn't get it right, the ball is looped up outside off, taken on the full and eventually it goes off a toe-end wide of backward square leg
ZIMBABWE:21.6 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, Mutumbami was winding up to play the big shot once again, but Aamer Yamin pulled his length back and forced the batsman to play a back foot defence
ZIMBABWE:21.5 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, FOUR, nearly a six. That is to the longest part of the ground to the deep mid-wicket region. Full and angled in on middle, Mutumbami plays the pick-up shot, off his legs and the ball sails a long way, at one stage it looked like it would go all the way, eventually it bounces one before crossing the ropes
ZIMBABWE:21.4 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, short and wide outside off, was there to be cut, Mutumbami went too hard on the shot and mistimed it to cover
ZIMBABWE:21.3 Aamer Yamin to Chari, 1 run, good length outside off, Chari opens the bat face and runs it down to third man
ZIMBABWE:21.2 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, 1 run, angled in on middle, turned wide of the short fine leg fielder who is Wahab Riaz who moves to his left and then slides to keep it to a single. Good piece of fielding that
ZIMBABWE:21.1 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, Mutumbami shimmies down the track, Aamer Yamin pulls his length back and forces the batsman to defend to mid-on
ZIMBABWE:20.6 Bilal Asif to Chari, no run, now the length is pulled back and Chari read that off the pitch, defends off the back foot
ZIMBABWE:20.5 Bilal Asif to Chari, no run, well tossed up outside off, Chari lunges forward and offers a dead blade to cover
ZIMBABWE:20.4 Bilal Asif to Chari, no run, shuffles across and turns it to the right of short mid-wicket, the fielder moves across quickly and prevents the thought of a quick singleBrian Chari, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:20.3 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, out Caught&Bowled!! That's a very soft dismissal. Chibhabha had played well so far but in trying to get close to the pitch of that and trying to play across the line, he perishes. Nicely bowled by Bilal Asif, pulled his length back and forced Chibhabha to play a false stroke, a soft leading edge as Chibhabha aimed to go to leg and a dolly back to the bowler. Gleefully accepted and Pakistan have their first wicket after 20.3 overs. One that they badly needed. Chibhabha c and b Bilal Asif 48(76) [4s-5]Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!
ZIMBABWE:20.2 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, tossed up outside off, Chibhabha gets forward and turns it to short mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:20.1 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, tossed up outside off, Chibhabha is forward to drive and in the end he has to lunge out as he isn't to the pitch of the ball, gets an inside edge onto the pad, the ball rolls to the right of the keeper
ZIMBABWE:19.6 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, this good length delivery is gently pushed on the rise to short cover
ZIMBABWE:19.5 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, on a fuller length outside off, Mutumbami watchfully defends off the front foot. Might have been the off-cutter from Yamin
ZIMBABWE:19.4 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, 1 run, on a back of a length outside off, Chibhabha uses his wrists to get on top of the ball and punches through the cover region
ZIMBABWE:19.3 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, 1 run, fraction fuller than a good length just outside off, bunted wide of the man at cover. Easy single before the fielder moves across to stop the ball
ZIMBABWE:19.2 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, 1 run, on a good length on off stump, Chibhabha gently pushes it from the crease wide of mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:19.1 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, a back of a length delivery around the fourth stump line, Chibhabha checks his punch back to the bowler
ZIMBABWE:18.6 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, 1 run, this time gets the clip away for a single through the mid-wicket region
ZIMBABWE:18.5 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, nicely flighted delivery on middle, Chibhabha tucks it gently to short mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:18.4 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, 1 run, loopy delivery which lands full on off, Mutumbami bunts it down to long-on. The keeper wasn't too happy with so much flight on the ball and told the bowler to reduce the loop
ZIMBABWE:18.3 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, no run, seemed like the top-spinner which held its line after pitching on a length on off, Mutumbami reads it off the pitch and offers a straight defensive blade
ZIMBABWE:18.2 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, 1 run, flatter this time and is nudged through mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:18.1 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, well flighted delivery turning in on off, Chibhabha is solid in defence
ZIMBABWE:17.6 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, fuller length delivery around off stump, hammered down the ground but straight to mid-on. Time to tee-off it seems
ZIMBABWE:17.5 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, shimmies down the track - getting too carried away perhaps. It was a back of a length delivery angling in on middle, Mutumbami adjusts and blocks it down the pitch
ZIMBABWE:17.4 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, FOUR, wow, frame that one. There are drives and then there are glorious extra-cover drives. Pitched up just outside off, Mutumbami leans forward and nails it wide of mid-off with perfection
ZIMBABWE:17.3 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, a cross-seam back of a length delivery outside off, Mutumbami might have been a bit early on his pull, gets it off the bottom of the bat. No worries though as the ball rolls along to mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:17.2 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, 1 run, on a good length and angling into the pads, Chibhabha clips it through the square leg region
ZIMBABWE:17.1 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, FOUR, picks his spot. Mid-on up in the ring and he goes bang. Was there in the slot to be honest. Fuller length delivery just outside off, Chibhabha clears his front leg to let in a clean swing of his arms and lofts it through the line comfortably clearing mid-onAamer Yamin [3.0-0-11-0] is back into the attack
ZIMBABWE:16.6 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, no run, well tossed up delivery around off, Mutumbami defends from the crease

ZIMBABWE:16.2 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, flatter outside off, Chibhabha makes room and punches it to cover
ZIMBABWE:16.1 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, a mild appeal for LBW but it seemed to have hit Chibhabha outside off. The batsman had missed his attempted flick but was hit outside the lineTime to have a drink!
ZIMBABWE:15.6 Irfan to Mutumbami, no run, dear me. Mutumbami is on the ground. Hope he is alright. Yes, he is now on his feet. Thank goodness. Looked so nasty in real time with his helmet flying off his head. A vicious bouncer from Irfan aiming for the badge, Mutumbami might have seen it late due to which he failed to duck underneath in time. Seemed to have been hit flush on the forehead - need replays to confirm it - and his helmet came off landing behind the stumps. Actually, replays show that he was hit near the temple. He was taken aback and nearly fell on his stumps
ZIMBABWE:15.5 Irfan to Chibhabha, 1 run, low full toss outside off from round the wicket, Chibhabha gets forward and pushes it to sweeper cover
ZIMBABWE:15.4 Irfan to Chibhabha, 2 runs, the Zimbabwean openers have been very impressive so far. Up to the challenge to whatever the bowlers have had to throw at them. A short of length delivery angling across off stump, Chibhabha rolls his wrists on the pull and sends it in front of square. The batsmen jog back for a second before deep square leg tidies up
ZIMBABWE:15.3 Irfan to Mutumbami, 1 run, on a back of a length and on the stumps, Mutumbami clips it through square leg
ZIMBABWE:15.2 Irfan to Mutumbami, no run, this one was much sharper. A vicious short of length delivery angling across the right-hander, Mutumbami does really well to drop his wrists and sway out of the line
ZIMBABWE:15.1 Irfan to Mutumbami, FOUR, a cross-seam short of length delivery from Irfan around off stump, Mutumbami gets on his toes and just upper-cuts it fine of third man
ZIMBABWE:14.6 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, 1 run, a loopy trajectory on this off-break which was turning into off, Mutumbami plants his front foot across and clips it across the front pad wide of mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:14.5 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, 1 run, finally gets the single away with a nice easy tap to long-off
ZIMBABWE:14.4 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, good work from mid-wicket, keeps the pressure on Chibhabha. It was flicked away just wide of the fielder who puts in the dive to make the save
ZIMBABWE:14.3 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, nice, compact front foot defence to a delivery which was well flighted
ZIMBABWE:14.2 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, gets forward but doesn't get close enough to the pitch and ends up defending
ZIMBABWE:14.1 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, no run, flighted delivery on middle stump, Chibhabha comes down the track and turns it to mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:13.6 Irfan to Mutumbami, no run, banged in halfway around off, Mutumbami jumps looking to ride the bounce and drops his wrists in the end to let it go
ZIMBABWE:13.5 Irfan to Mutumbami, no run, what was that? A superb flick followed by a waft down the ground. On a length and angling away outside off, Mutumbami looks to play the lofted drive over mid-off. Ends up dragging it off the inside half straight to the fielder
ZIMBABWE:13.4 Irfan to Mutumbami, FOUR, glorious shot. So easy to fall over playing the flick but he keeps his posture. Fuller length delivery around middle, Mutumbami leans forward and rolls his wrists beautifully to send it through the vacant mid-wicket region. Mid-on gives chase but in vain
ZIMBABWE:13.3 Irfan to Chibhabha, 1 run, on a back of a length on the stumps, Chibhabha hops back in the crease and nurdles it down to fine leg
ZIMBABWE:13.2 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, pitched further up around the fifth stump line, Chibhabha reluctantly comes forward and pushes it to mid-off
ZIMBABWE:13.1 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, a back of a length delivery around off, Chibhabha blocks it off the back footMohammad Irfan [3.0-0-14-0] is back into the attackChange of ends for Irfan
ZIMBABWE:12.6 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, 1 run, gets the single away this time with a nice roll of his wrists to tuck the ball wide of that man at backward square leg

ZIMBABWE:12.2 Bilal Asif to Mutumbami, no run, a bit quicker through the air and the delivery lands fullish just outside off, Mutumbami defends with bat and pad close together
ZIMBABWE:12.1 Bilal Asif to Chibhabha, 1 run, well tossed up delivery on middle stump, easily flicked through the mid-wicket regionBilal Asif, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
ZIMBABWE:11.6 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, nice and loopy on off stump, Mutumbami prods forward in defence
ZIMBABWE:11.5 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, pushed through flatter by Wasim just outside off, Mutumbami looks to dab it late but mistimes it to short third man
ZIMBABWE:11.4 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, FOUR, it has been good calculated cricket so far. Not allowing the spinner to dictate terms. A loopy delivery just outside off, Mutumbami goes down on one knee and hammers the sweep in the air through mid-wicket. The man in the deep was too straight
ZIMBABWE:11.3 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, nearly through the batsman. It was the arm-ball coming in on off, Mutumbami reads it off the pitch and just about gets his bat in line to block
ZIMBABWE:11.2 Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, 1 run, a flighted delivery just outside off, Chibhabha gets forward and drives it to the man sweeping the off-side boundary
ZIMBABWE:11.1 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, 1 run, a bit more air given this time around off, Mutumbami gently bunts it through the covers
ZIMBABWE:10.6 Riaz to Chibhabha, no run, pitched up this time outside off, Chibhabha times his drive nicely square of the wicket but cannot beat Hafeez's dive at backward point
ZIMBABWE:10.5 Riaz to Chibhabha, no run, just loose outside off stump. Riaz seems to be hurrying the batsman with his slingy skiddy deliveries. Slightly fuller than a back of a length and angling across in the channel outside off, Chibhabha is very late in his attempted steer to third man and beaten on the outside edge
ZIMBABWE:10.4 Riaz to Mutumbami, 1 run, slightly back of a length on middle, Mutumbami clips it through the mid-wicket region
ZIMBABWE:10.3 Riaz to Chibhabha, 1 run, another skiddy back of a length delivery around off, Chibhabha moves across on the back foot and works it through mid-wicket

ZIMBABWE:10.1 Riaz to Chibhabha, no run, back of a length delivery angling away in the channel outside off, Chibhabha tries a half-hearted poke through the off-side off the back foot, beaten on the inside edge. No purpose in the shot reall
ZIMBABWE:9.6 Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, 1 run, drifting in with the arm on middle, once again Chibhabha skips down the track and gets the single away with a push to long-on
ZIMBABWE:9.5 Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, no run, shimmies down the track to a flat, quick delivery, tries to adjust and work it through the on-side but ends up wearing it on the thigh pad
ZIMBABWE:9.4 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, 1 run, dropped by Riaz at deep backward square leg! Another flatter delivery on the stumps, Mutumbami looked to have deliberately lifted the sweep in the air and put it straight down the throat of the man. Riaz has put down a regulation catch
ZIMBABWE:9.4 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, wide, fired in but sliding down leg, Mutumbami misses with his glance
ZIMBABWE:9.3 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, SIX, Mutumbami launches this one wide of long-on. A fullish delivery around off, Mutumbami clears his front leg and smokes it against the turn, just about cleared the ropes
ZIMBABWE:9.2 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, another delivery which was pushed through the air around off, Mutumbami pushes it to cover
ZIMBABWE:9.1 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, no run, drifting in with the air on middle, was quicker through the air, Mutumbami gets half-forward and blocks
ZIMBABWE:8.6 Riaz to Mutumbami, 1 run, on a length outside off, Mutumbami runs it down to third man with an open bat face off the front foot
ZIMBABWE:8.5 Riaz to Mutumbami, no run, that one definitely stayed a touch low. It was a back of a length delivery in the outside off corridor, Mutumbami was defending on the back foot but is beaten by the lack of bounce on the inside edge. Goes on the bounce to the keeper
ZIMBABWE:8.4 Riaz to Mutumbami, 2 runs, on a good length and on the pads, Mutumbami just about gets the bat down in time to clip it behind square. The fine leg fielder gives chase but cannot prevent the couple
ZIMBABWE:8.3 Riaz to Mutumbami, no run, angling away in the channel outside off, left alone
ZIMBABWE:8.2 Riaz to Chibhabha, 1 run, a slightly back of a length delivery in the channel outside off, Chibhabha steers it in front of backward point and sets off for a well judged run
ZIMBABWE:8.1 Riaz to Chibhabha, FOUR, looks like the 90 in the previous game has helped Chibhabha immensely. Playing with a lot more freedom in this game. A back of a length delivery angling away around the fifth stump, Chibhabha gets in position early and crunches the pull along the carpet to the right of mid-wicket. The fielder should have done better with the dive but allows the ball to sneak through
ZIMBABWE:7.6 Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, 1 run, a well tossed up delivery drifting in on middle, Chibhabha gently flicks it wide of mid-wicket and will keep the strike
ZIMBABWE:7.5 Imad Wasim to Mutumbami, 1 run, well done Irfan. Saved some runs for his team. Slider on the pads, Mutumbami glances it fine to the right of the fielder, Irfan goes down in instalment on the dive and manages to stop the ball
ZIMBABWE:7.4 Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, 1 run, skips down the track to a flighted delivery around off, nearly gets to the pitch of it and milks it down to long-off
ZIMBABWE:7.3 Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, no run, a bit slower through the air on the stumps, Chibhabha comes forward and pushes it back to the bowler
ZIMBABWE:7.2 Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, no run, sliding on the pads, Chibhabha misses his flick and wears it on the pad, the drift would have taken it down leg
ZIMBABWE:7.1 Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, no run, shimmies down the track and Wasim fires it on Chibhabha's pads, he flicks it to square leg and sets off for no reason. He is sent back and just about makes it with a full length dive, direct-hit would have got Chibhabha outThird umpire has been called for a run-out appeal. Looks like the dive has saved Chibhabha. Yes, he is safeImad Wasim, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attackTakes only 7 overs to get spin on.
ZIMBABWE:6.6 Riaz to Mutumbami, no run, slightly back of a length delivery just outside off, Mutumbami steers it to backward point
ZIMBABWE:6.5 Riaz to Mutumbami, no run, fraction fuller than a good length outside off, Mutumbami shoulders arms
ZIMBABWE:6.4 Riaz to Mutumbami, 2 runs, a similar back of a length delivery around off, this time Mutumbami tucks it away through square leg. The mid-wicket fielder gives chase and hunts it down but the batsmen have enough time to return for a second
ZIMBABWE:6.3 Riaz to Mutumbami, no run, on a back of a length around off stump, Mutumbami gets behind and turns it away towards mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:6.2 Riaz to Mutumbami, no run, a good length delivery angling away in the channel outside off, Mutumbami lifts his bat and lets it go
ZIMBABWE:6.1 Riaz to Mutumbami, no run, ouch, ouch, ouch. That would hurt. Mutumbami is on his knees cringing in pain. Might be the wrist or the forearm, not quite sure. Looks to be the wrist. Coming to the ball, it was a just short of length delivery around the fourth stump line, Mutumbami drops his wrists looking to sway out of the line but the ball doesn't bounce much at all. Hits him flush on the wrist. The physio has done his job, Mutumbami has a strapping on the wrist and looks good to goWahab Riaz, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
ZIMBABWE:5.6 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, pitched up just outside off, Chibhabha drives it to cover
ZIMBABWE:5.5 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, 3 runs, aerial but clears the infield. Fraction fuller than a good length outside off, wasn't full enough to be driving. Mutumbami goes through with it on the rise and perhaps played it well in front of his body due to which he wasn't able to keep it down. The ball is in the air but over cover-point
ZIMBABWE:5.4 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, on a length and outside off, Mutumbami lets it go to the keeper
ZIMBABWE:5.3 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, 1 run, angling into the pads on a fuller length, Chibhabha flicks it behind square and down to fine leg
ZIMBABWE:5.2 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, angling back in on off on a good length, Chibhabha defends from the crease
ZIMBABWE:5.1 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, FOUR, a brilliant shot, not a very bad ball at all but Chibhabha makes it into one. Slightly back of a length delivery wide of off, Chibhabha uses his wrists to get on top of the ball and cuts it away through the cover-point region. It bisected backward point and cover to perfection. The ball teased the fielder into the ad cushions
ZIMBABWE:4.6 Irfan to Chibhabha, 1 run, fraction fuller than a good length just outside off, Chibhabha tries to go more towards extra-cover with the drive but drags it off the inside half of the bat wide of mid-on. The fielder was caught on his heels and the batsmen scamper across
ZIMBABWE:4.5 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, on a good length and angling across off, Chibhabha moves across on the back foot and gently pushes it towards mid-off
ZIMBABWE:4.4 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, banged in halfway by Irfan. Chibhabha saw it early and ducked underneath
ZIMBABWE:4.3 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, on a length around off, Chibhabha presses forward and drives it to mid-off
ZIMBABWE:4.2 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, back of a length delivery around off stump, Chibhabha is more assertive in his defence off the back foot
ZIMBABWE:4.1 Irfan to Chibhabha, FOUR, a fortuitous boundary for Chibhabha aided by some terrible fielding at third man. Short of length delivery which rises disconcertingly around off stump. Chibhabha tries to ride the bounce in defence but only manages an outside edge which evades first slip and rolls down to third man. The fielder (Wahab Riaz) reluctantly bends but the ball sneaks through his hands
ZIMBABWE:3.6 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, 1 run, slightly back of a length delivery outside off, punched to the left of mid-off.
ZIMBABWE:3.5 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, pulls his length back a touch with this inswinger on middle, this time Chibhabha is solidly behind and defends it back to the bowler
ZIMBABWE:3.4 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, slightly fuller than a good length and nipping back in on middle, Chibhabha was looking to go down the ground with his drive but the bat face turns on impact and ends up rolling around the ground to mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:3.3 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, Chibhabha will feel he missed out here. The delivery was straying down leg, any bat on it and would have been a boundary. Instead, the ball only clips the pad through to the keeper
ZIMBABWE:3.2 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, angling into the pads on a back of a length, clipped to the right of mid-wicket. The fielder dives and parries the ball towards square leg
ZIMBABWE:3.1 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, back of a length delivery with some width on offer, Chibhabha throws his bat looking for a flashy cut but connects with only thin air
ZIMBABWE:2.6 Irfan to Chibhabha, 1 run, just short of length delivery on the body, Chibhabha gets on top of the ball and turns it wide of mid-on
ZIMBABWE:2.5 Irfan to Chibhabha, 2 runs, oh another sumptuous back foot punch, a back of a length delivery just wide of off, Chibhabha stands tall and firmly punches it through cover. Mid-off gives chase and cuts it off
ZIMBABWE:2.4 Irfan to Chibhabha, 2 runs, risky but gets it away. Slightly fuller outside off, Chibhabha plants his front foot across and drives square of the wicket to the right of backward point. The fielder moves across and puts in the dive to no avail. The ball doesn't have enough legs though and is hunted down by cover
ZIMBABWE:2.3 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, angling away around the fifth stump line, Chibhabha resists the temptation this time
ZIMBABWE:2.2 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, superb from Irfan. Varying his lengths and keeping the batsman honest. Pitched this one right up and it was angling away in the channel outside off. Chibhabha was perhaps expecting another short one and his feet went nowhere looking for the straight drive. Beaten on the outside edge
ZIMBABWE:2.1 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, short of length delivery angling across the right-hander, Chibhabha rises on his toes to ride the bounce and fends it with soft hands into the off-side
ZIMBABWE:1.6 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, no run, on a length outside off, Mutumbami doesn't bother with it
ZIMBABWE:1.5 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, 1 run, a shimmy down the track this time - perhaps to counter the movement. It was slightly back of a good length and angling in on middle, Chibhabha nearly loses his balance while looking to tuck it away but composes himself and gets it awya behind square
ZIMBABWE:1.4 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, a similar inswinging delivery around off and middle, Chibhabha defends from the crease
ZIMBABWE:1.3 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, now some swing - just a hint of it but would encourage the bowler. Coming back in around off and middle on a length, Chibhabha allows the ball to do its bit and then offers a vertical bat in defence
ZIMBABWE:1.2 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, not much movement so far for the pacers. This delivery was pitched up by Yamin just outside off, Chibhabha gets forward and pushes it to mid-off
ZIMBABWE:1.1 Aamer Yamin to Mutumbami, 1 run, slightly back of a length delivery around the sixth stump line, Mutumbami waits on the back foot and taps it in front of backward point. A good early call from the non-striker sees the batsmen make it through comfortablyAamer Yamin, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
ZIMBABWE:0.6 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, a swing and a miss outside off. Slightly short and wide of off, Chibhabha went hard with a slash but the extra Irfan bounce beats the outside edge
ZIMBABWE:0.5 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, back of a length delivery angling away in the channel outside off, a gentle punch towards cover from Chibhabha. Slightly dangerous as he didn't move across to cover the line
ZIMBABWE:0.4 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, fuller length delivery on middle, Chibhabha stays rooted to the crease and gently pushes it to mid-on
ZIMBABWE:0.3 Irfan to Chibhabha, FOUR, authoritative. Sends the message straightaway. Slightly back of a length delivery angling across the right-hander, Chibhabha moves across slightly on the back foot and punches it down the ground straight of mid-off. The fielder gets across and puts in the dive but fails to get a hand
ZIMBABWE:0.2 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, more the natural length this time from Irfan - back of a length on the hips. Chibhabha gently tucks it to the FSL in place
ZIMBABWE:0.1 Irfan to Chibhabha, no run, what a ball to start with, nearly in the blockhole - missed it by an inch or so. The ball swung back in late on middle and the batsman does well to get his front pad out of the way before digging it outChibhabha and Mutumbami are at the crease. Chibhabha is on strike. Irfan will open the attackThe players are making their way out to the centre. The sturdy, tall Mohammad Irfan is marking his run-up. Two slips and a deepish short-leg in place for him. Right, so here we go..Chigumbura: "We have to repeat the same processes like Saturday. See out the first hour. The pitch looks a bit drier today. The main concern was the fielding last time, have to be a lot more clinical today. Two changes for us. Mutumbodzi and Waller come in for Cremer and Masakadza."Sarfraz: "We're going to bowl first. It looks like a good pitch, compared to the two ODIs before. Azhar is not playing due to a foot infection."Teams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Brian Chari, Chamu Chibhabha, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sikandar Raza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Tinotenda Mutombodzi, Malcolm Waller, Luke Jongwe, Tinashe Panyangara, John NyumbuPakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Bilal Asif, Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed(w/c), Mohammad Rizwan, Imad Wasim, Aamer Yamin, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad IrfanOkay, some big news coming through. Azhar Ali won't be playing today due to a foot infection. Sarfraz Ahmed will take over as captain in his absence.After their chasing troubles in the previous match (never mind their long history), I would have thought Pakistan might want to bat first today. Hmm... Interesting.Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldI'm curious to see what the pitch holds in store for today. The last match was the closest we came to seeing some grass on the surface. The other pitches on this tour have all been big turners - Zimbabwe playing more than gracious hosts. Keep the scissors in the locker Mr. Curator would be the mandate, I presume.Zimbabwe have some history to look forward to. They haven't beaten Pakistan ever in a bilateral series. No seriously, never. The hosts might be without leggie Graeme Cremer who badly twisted his ankle in the 2nd ODI. Pakistan, on the other hand, rested an in-form Imad Wasim for the last match. Can't see that happening today.Pakistan, oh Pakistan. Like a turtle and its shell, Pakistan and inconsistency have proved to be inseparables over the years. Okay, never mind my terrible attempt at an analogy, but you get the point (?). Still, you've got to feel for Shoaib Malik. That bloke produced one of his best knocks in a seemingly hopeless situation and nearly pulled off one of the more remarkable come-from-behind wins in contemporary cricket. Only to be denied by the fading light with two overs to go. He had Zimbabwe all rattled and at his mercy. But, you can't fight the weather gods.The farcical climax in the previous match notwithstanding, credit to Zimbabwe for lifting themselves from the doldrums and putting on a show their fans can be proud of. What it also means is that the series is level at 1-1 and will only be decided after today's 3rd and final ODI. Good afternoon people and welcome to our ball-by-ball coverage.Preview:It was a decision that left Pakistan in dismay and Shoaib Malik furious but umpires calling the players off for bad light meant that Zimbabwe won the second ODI by five runs (D/L method) to register their first victory against Pakistan in over two years. Having squared the series, the hosts will enter the third ODI seeking a historic bilateral ODI series win, something which they have never achieved against Pakistan. However, it won't be easy going at all for Zimbabwe as Azhar Ali's men, seething after the controversial loss, will look to hit back hard.Match Date: October 5, 2015Start Time: 9:30 local (13:00 IST)Venue: Harare Sports ClubWeather: Sunny, high of 30 degree CelsiusZimbabwe:Under pressure after being skittled out for 128 in an embarrassing defeat in the first ODI, Zimbabwe batsmen showed good application in the second game as they finished with a healthy total. Skipper Elton Chigumbura, who was one of two half-centurions for Zimbabwe, will expect a similar effort from the batsmen in the final game of the series. The hosts will be slightly worried with their bowling, considering that they nearly let the game slip after reducing Pakistan to 76/6 at one stage. Zimbabwe will also hope that spinner Graeme Cremer, who injured himself, in the second ODI, is available to take the field for the decider.Probable XI: Brian Chari, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Elton Chigumbura (c), Richmond Mutumbami (wk), Luke Jongwe, Graeme Cremer, Tinashe Panyangara, John NyumbuPakistan:Pakistan have a lot of problems with their batting order, especially the ones at the top, who have been a big let down in the series so far. The skipper himself is due for runs while the likes of Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad and Asad Shafiq haven't done much either with the bat. The lower order, which has been bailing the team out of trouble, will be hoping for the top-order batsmen to get the team off to a good start at least once in this series. Pakistan do not have too many problems as far as the bowling line-up is concerned, but death bowling is an area of concern.Probable XI: Azhar Ali (c), Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sarfraz Ahmed (wk), Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Imad Wasim, Aamer Yamin, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Mohammad IrfanQuotes:"In the game of cricket, you can't relax until the very last ball."- Elton Chigumbura warned his side against getting complacent after moving into a comfortable position in the game."Being a professional cricketer and representing your country, you have to follow certain rules and regulations."- Shoaib Malik admitted he was disappointed with the unfortunate circumstances surrounding his team's defeat in the 2nd ODI but said the team will put that behind them.Teams:Pakistan (From): Azhar Ali(c), Bilal Asif, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Asad Shafiq, Sarfraz Ahmed, Mohammad Rizwan(w), Wahab Riaz, Aamer Yamin, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Irfan, Ahmed Shehzad, Sohaib Maqsood, Imad Wasim, Babar Azam, Rahat AliZimbabwe (From): Brian Chari, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Graeme Cremer, Luke Jongwe, John Nyumbu, Tinashe Panyangara, Prosper Utseya, Malcolm Waller, Neville Madziva, Chris Mpofu, Taurai Muzarabani, Tinotenda Mutombodzi, Craig ErvineLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
