The umpires are scheduled to have an inspection at 10:00 local time.Ireland are looking strong after their thumping win in the first ODI. Can the visitors turn the tables around with a spirited show today? Hello and a warm welcome to the second ODI between Ireland and Scotland. None apart from Michael Leask were willing to put on a show for the visitors in the first ODI and he was the only batsman to score more than 30 in their innings. However, the hosts were easily able to sail through, despite a gritty fifty from Leask, as their top-order combined well to steal a 7-wicket victory. Scotland need to sort out their batting woes if they are to stay alive in the series. It will be interesting to see the team combination of both the sides. Toss and more coming up in a short while...Teams:Scotland (From): Matthew Cross(w), Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Freddie Coleman, Josh Davey, Michael A Leask, Safyaan Sharif, Majid Haq, Iain Wardlaw, Alasdair Evans, Matt MachanIreland (From): Andrew Balbirnie, John Anderson, Andrew Poynter, Kevin O'Brien(c), Stuart Thompson, Stuart Poynter(w), Andrew White, John Mooney, Andy McBrine, Max Sorensen, Craig Young, Graeme McCarter, George DockrellLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
