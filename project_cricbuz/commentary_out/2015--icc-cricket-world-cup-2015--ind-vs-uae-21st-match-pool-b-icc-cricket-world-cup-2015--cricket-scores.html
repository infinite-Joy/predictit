INDIA:16.1 M Tauqir to Rohit, 1 run, Tauqir drops one short and just outside off, punched away towards long-off for a singleWelcome back.. India have taken the batting PP immediatelyOnce Dhawan was dismissed, it was Rohit, who opened up his shoulders by essaying a couple of magnificent pull shots off Naveed's bowling in the ninth over of the innings. He also played a crunching drive through the extra cover in the same over. Virat Kohli too looked in fine touch and showed his class with a back foot punch off Guruge to collect four runs. When the umpires called for the dinner break, India looked well on course to chase down the modest target. Earlier, Ravichandran Ashwin was the star performer for India as he took a four-wicket haul. Ravindra Jadeja picked up two wickets. The seamers too chipped in by taking wickets at regular intervals. To make it even better for India, the fielding was good as well.While chasing down a meagre target, openers Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan started on a cautious note before Mohammad Naveed snared the wicket of Dhawan, with Rohan Mustafa taking a splendid catch at backward point. In fact, Naveed and Manjula Guruge bowled reasonably well upfront, but UAE just didn't get enough runs on the board to give India a run for their money. That's the dinner break. For the second time in this World Cup, we will have a 45-minute break with the match all but over. Talk about the playing conditions.. We have had two D/N matches today. The one at Auckland ended even before the floodlights were switched on, looks like the same case, here in Perth, unless, it gets dark at the end of the 45-minute break.

Naveed will open the attackWelcome back.. How long will India take to finish this off? Rohit needs some runs, can't get a better opportunity than this. We have around 65-70 minutes for the dinner break.. that will mean - around 15-16 overs.Ashwin: "It's been a long time since I've got a fourth wicket, I mean in the sense that I've never got a 4-fer before. It was a running on my mind a bit, but having said that I was focusing on my basics and it's coming out really well. The last time I bowled here at Perth against Sri Lanka I enjoyed a lot. There is a wee bit of spin if you bowl it really slow and apart from that, you are really hitting the top of the face all the time because of the bounce. I quite enjoyed bowling here. The arm-ball was going really well because of the two new balls, you got shine on one of the sides and you can use it pretty much better. If you mix up the pace and if you can really bowl the arm-ball and really set-up the batsman and bowl one really slow, you are going to pretty much get the batsman fending on the front foot, then the leg slip is going to come into play. It's not about the numbers as I've always gone about my business. When I've always turned up for India it's about bowling in the tough situations I really want the ball all the time. If there is a scenario where you need to put the hand up and that's what I am looking at all the time. We pretty much spoke about it even before the tournament began, we've always peaked really well at the ICC tournaments and it was quite a hard time after the Test series, we were playing a tri-series in which we were trying a few combinations and all that. But when the tournament comes, we knew we'll pick it up."India's fielding too was sharp, though the usually reliable Suresh Raina dropped a simple catch to give Mohammad Naveed a reprieve. In fact, it turned out to be the first drop catch of this World Cup for India. India will look to chase down the target quickly and improve their net run rate. At the other end of the spectrum, UAE's total of 102 is their lowest ever score in ODIs. They need to take a few wickets to at least lift their sagging morale. Once Krishnachandran Karate was dismissed, rest of the batsmen didn't seem to have a clue while facing up to Ashwin's box of tricks. Only Shaiman Anwar, who has clearly been their best player in this mega event showed the application and the technique to score a flurry of boundaries and compile a well-measured innings of 35. He used the depth of the crease to keep the scoreboard moving. Shaiman also stitched a useful partnership for the last wicket with Manjula Guruge. After playing with a dash of fearlessness in the first two games against Zimbabwe and Ireland, it has been a disastrous performance put up by UAE. On the other hand, the Indian camp will be happy after putting up a thoroughly professional show with the ball in hand. Earlier, UAE's openers Andri Berenger and Amjad Ali struggled to cope up with the pace and bounce and were dismissed in the first five overs of the innings. Indian pacers, on their part, used the short ball to good effect. Umesh Yadav snared the wicket of Berenger with a short delivery and Amjad followed him back to the pavilion, as a result of another short delivery from Bhuvneshwar Kumar. On the back of Ravichandran Ashwin's excellent spell of spin bowling, India skittled out the opposition ranks for a paltry score. Ashwin used the breeze from south-west to good effect to hold it up in the air and take a four-wicket haul. He also used the arm ball well. It turned out to be Ashwin's best figures in ODIs. Ravindra Jadeja too picked up a couple of wickets. UAE's batsmen didn't help their cause by showing poor technique against both the pacers and Ashwin. None of their batsmen tried to get themselves in and adjust to the extra pace and bounce on offer at the WACA.Raina pats Ashwin on the back as the players walk off the field. The Indian fans are absolutely ecstatic in the stands.3

Fullish and angling away from the left-hander, Khan pokes at it without much of a feet movement, the ball takes a thick edge and flies away to third manHere is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 15 overs: UAE made a poor start as they lost the wicket of Andri Berenger in the second over of the innings. Amjad Ali and Krishnachandran Karate too struggled to keep the scorecard ticking. Amjad was eventually, dismissed by Bhuvneshwar Kumar. Umesh Yadav used the bounce and carry to good effect to trouble UAE's batsmen. Bhuvneshwar in his comeback game swung the ball, but it was the short delivery that did the trick for him. To make it worse for UAE, Ravichandran Ashwin snared the wickets of Karate and Swapnil Patil. It is crystal clear that UAE's batsmen lack the experience to play on a deck that is offering assistance for the pacers.Undoubtedly, WACA is famous for producing lightning fast tracks. However, on occasions, the curators have also come under severe criticism for producing cracked up surfaces. In the 1997 Test match played between Australia and the West Indies, Curtly Ambrose produced an unplayable delivery that hit a crack and stayed low to shatter Greg Blewett's stumps. The next year, Simon Cook ripped through New Zealand's batting line-up on a track that had almost become unplayable by Day 4 of that Test match. In 2000, a List A games between Western Australia and Queensland was abandoned after just five overs were bowled as it proved to be a treacherous track. No wonder, from time to time, curators like Ken Johnston, Scott Hamilton, David Crane, Richard Winder and Cam Sutherland have come under pressure.

Hawk-Eye shows that ball would have clipped the top of off stump, but it was umpire's call
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.1 Bhuvneshwar to Amjad Ali, 1 run, Ali is lucky to have inside-edged that ball. Bhuvneshwar swings this good length delivery back into the left-hander, Ali looks to work it across, gets an inside edge onto pad and it rolls towards backward square leg
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.6 U Yadav to Karate, no run, Dale Steyn would be so proud of this over from Yadav.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.4 U Yadav to Andri Berenger, out Caught by Dhoni!! He's bowled really well and it's a deserving wicket for Yadav. It's a bouncy and pacy pitch, Yadav bangs this short, Berenger has no clue about the pace on this delivery, he is very late in his pull shot, the ball takes the top edge, Dhoni calls 'mine, mine, mine', moves to his left and easily swallows the ball. This is not the start UAE wanted after opting to bat first. Andri Berenger c Dhoni b U Yadav 4(9) [4s-1]U Yadav to Andri Berenger, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.3 U Yadav to Andri Berenger, no run, beauty from Yadav! Excellent shape away from the right-hander, Berenger had to play at it. This length ball was close to the off stump, Berenger tries to defend and the ball swings away very late and beats the bat

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.1 U Yadav to Amjad Ali, 1 run, catch it is the cry, but the ball just about manages to evade Rohit Sharma. Yadav starts off with a pacy bumper, Ali was late on the pull shot, the ball took the top edge and flew towards backward square leg, Rohit, from mid-wicket ran and dived full length to his left but couldn't get there in timeUmesh Yadav, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.6 Bhuvneshwar to Andri Berenger, FOUR, in the air, but in the gap. Full and shaping away outside off stump, Berenger comes on the front foot and square drives the ball through cover-point and opens his account in style

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.4 Bhuvneshwar to Andri Berenger, no run, good shape away from the right-hander, teasing line from Bhuvneshwar. On a fullish length and outside off stump, Berenger thought about playing at it, but let it go at the last moment

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.1 Bhuvneshwar to Amjad Ali, 2 wides, wayward start for Bhuvneshwar. He bowls this down the leg-side, Dhoni had to stretch full length to his right to half-stop the ballAmjad Ali and Andri Berenger are at the crease. Amjad Ali is on strike. Bhuvneshwar will open the attackBhuvneshwar Kumar will take the new ball on his return. He has two slips in place.The anthems are done and the UAE openers put on their helmets as India walk onto the field.The teams are walking out for the national anthems. UAE's "Ishy Bilady" will be followed by India's "Jana Gana Mana."Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Umesh YadavUnited Arab Emirates (Playing XI): Amjad Ali, Andri Berenger, Krishnachandran Karate, Khurram Khan, Swapnil Patil(w), Shaiman Anwar, Rohan Mustafa, Amjad Javed, Mohammad Naveed, Mohammad Tauqir(c), Manjula GurugeUnited Arab Emirates have won the toss and have opted to batTauqir: "I think we were a bit unlucky in the last game, putting up 280 on the board is a good effort by the batsmen. I think we need to bowl well and field well to defend the total. We are just ready for this game, we will try to put up a decent performance again. We will bat first. I think it's a good wicket to bat on first and we would like to put up a total and then defend it. No (when asked if UAE made any changes). It's the same side as the last game."Dhoni: "I think we have been putting in a lot of effort and it's starting to reflect in our performances. It's good, you want to win games, you want to execute your plans well and so far, all the three departments, they have done that. Not disappointed, we were looking to bat first, but at the same time it's good that, we have batted first quite a few times and this gives us an opportunity to chase down the total. For the long term benefit we have rested Shami in this game, Bhuvi comes in his place. It also gives us a chance to have a look at Bhuvi. He has been our main bowler for close to an year or so, but it gives him an opportunity coming back from injury. He has been fit for a long time, so he has been just waiting for this opportunity to come and play."It's toss time folks!Pitch Report: "This is one of the fastest pitches in the world. It's very hard and the fast bowlers will have a big smile on their faces. The ball comes on to the bat, because of its true bounce, so it is good for batting as well. As a batsman, the key word here is if you get through the first 20 balls, you can score runs. India are just starting to show some form. I would be certainly selecting a pure bowler, I wouldn't go for an all-rounder in Stuart Binny. Bat first and get runs on the board." reckon Sanjay Manjrekar and Tom Moody.My colleague, Pradeep has this on Krishna Chandran Karate - "Classmate with Robin Uthappa at school. Classmate with Binny at college and also represented Bangalore University at cricket.'"For people who saw me playing in my shorts, with a tennis ball, on the streets of my home village of Kollengode, it's going to be a big thing to watch me on TV, playing against India, in a World Cup match, at a ground like the WACA."Here he tells Sportskeeda's Dipankar Lahiri about his younger days. "It's going to be a big moment for people back home," said the 30-year-old all-rounder, who moved to the Gulf in 2010.One more Indian connection in the UAE camp. Krishna Chandran Karate hails from a village in Kerala and once was part of a Bangalore club side featuring Stuart Binny. He also is a former team-mate of S Sreesanth as the duo had played together for Kerala.Here is Swapnil talking to the Indian Express' Sandeep Dwivedi. "As juniors we have spent much time together. Because of distances in Mumbai, we couldn't hang out together after games but Ajinkya is like a brother. Once I moved out of India, we lost contact. But that day at the Dubai airport, he was returning from India's A tour to South Africa, it was like old times again," says Patil, eagerly awaiting the moment when he'll gets off the flight at Perth airport. "I haven't got in touch with Ajinkya yet since landing here but will meet him there and if possible take him out for dinner. Actually, not just him, I also have also been in Mumbai sides that had Rohit Sharma and Dhawal Kulkarni."An Indian connection in the UAE camp! UAE's Swapnil Patil was born in Vasai in Mumbai. Swapnil and Ajinkya Rahane were team-mates and were part of the Mumbai Under-14, 16, 19 and 22 middle order. Bigger things were destined for Swapnil but unfortunately the going got tough. He gave up and headed to the Gulf to join a business group that had a cricket team. Job security was there and Swapnil could concentrate on his cricket. Also playing in the UAE league was a far easier proposition.Mohammad Tauqir - "Zimbabwe won the game in the 48th over and the Ireland game went up to the last over. We need to cross the line now and we are getting closer to a victory."Some quotes for your perusal: Dhawan - "Just staying calm, working hard and keeping my work ethic strong."Weather update: It never rains at Perth! Or does so rarely. No problems with the weather for Saturday's clash. A high of 31 degrees is expected on match day.Pre-match team news, UAE: UAE will in all probability play the same team that played against Ireland.With Shami ruled out, either Bhuvneshwar Kumar or Stuart Binny will get a game at Perth. Going by India's training session before the game, it looks like that Binny will get the nod as he was involved in a rigorous practice session. That should be the only forced change that India may make despite playing against UAE.Pre-match team news, India: Mohammed Shami was ruled out of Saturday's clash against UAE with a minor knee injury. Shami had an ultrasound guided injection on his problematic knee yesterday. "Mohammed Shami got mild left-knee problem and had ultrasound guided injection yesterday," India's media manager, RN Baba told at the pre-match press conference in Perth. "For his long term management perspective he won't be available for tomorrow match against UAE.""If you look at the Zimbabwe game and the following one against Ireland, there was a definite improvement in our overall performance," he said. "Zimbabwe won the game in the 48th over and the Ireland game went up to the last over. We need to cross the line now and we are getting closer to a victory."Despite being unable to put it past Zimbabwe and Ireland, Tauqir is looking at the positive side of things, saying they are inching closer to their maiden victory.What is the UAE skipper saying ahead of his clash? Mohammad Tauqir has said his team is not daunted by the prospect of facing defending champions India. "We are getting closer to victory and the mood in the dressing room is very positive," Tauqir told reporters in a media interaction ahead of the game on Friday. "Everybody is looking forward to this game. We are not intimidated by any big name or big teams. All the games are equally important to us and the intensity is going to be the same in the next match as it was in the previous two games, and going forward also.""I want to see the likes of Rohit Sharma, (Suresh) Raina get in and get some runs. You never know what can happen later on in the tournament, so it's a perfect opportunity for India to try out a few new players, get them in form, get their confidence up. It is important that you have an entire squad ready to fire and I think Dhoni and Co should be thinking about that. There should not be any reservation about winning or losing because they are playing against one of the minnows," opined Lara.West Indian legend Brian Lara feels India are playing the best cricket of the World Cup and wants them to test their bench strength against UAE. "I think you would expect the reserves of the Indian team to dominate the opposition (UAE). The likes of Shikhar Dhawan and (Virat) Kohli might be scoring runs now but what is important is that later on in the tournament in the critical games if India is forced to call upon somebody from the reserves then they have the time out in the middle to do so."Dhawan also took the opportunity to focus on Ravi Shastri's role which he feels central to him being back in form. "His [Shastri] presence is very big on our side; he has always given me a lot of confidence, especially when I needed it," he said. "Ravi is central to my team-mates and my support staff. Because of that today I'm scoring runs - it is because my team-mates and my support staff have supported me."He must have changed something, surely, to transform into the Dhawan of Mohali. "Just staying calm, working hard and keeping my work ethic strong," Dhawan reflected. "Of course, it's always a learning thing. I enjoy the journey rather than the destination. So I was enjoying that phase of my life too, and I learned a lot. I changed a few things, but not any major things. Just little things. Maybe you won't be able to see - it's that little of something. I was just [trying to] enjoy the tour."One man who has turned around his fortunes remarkably is Indian opener, Shikhar Dhawan. After a miserable series Down Under in both the Test and the tri-series that followed, Dhawan's selection for the World Cup was questioned by some. So poor was his form. He was dropped for the Sydney Test as KL Rahul took his place at the top of the order and promptly scored a ton, which only put more pressure on him. The fortunes though have changed in a matter of two games. Against Pakistan he was set for a hundred when he was run out and against South Africa at the 'G' he was just superb. Against Steyn, Philander and Morkel he showed why when he is in form, he is a match-winner for India, at the top of the order."He regularly works night shifts at our petroleum storage terminal in Al Quoz so that he can train early evenings with the UAE team.""Shaiman has made us all proud. Immediately on arrival he and his family will be gifted a free holiday as a token of our appreciation. His performance is the result of his dedication and hard work," he said.After watching the match, Ramamoorthy told Gulf News how he had granted leave for Shaiman to play in the World Cup and his reward when he gets back.UAE had plenty of opportunities in the field when Wilson and O'Brien were batting, but those mishaps proved to be costly as they let the Irish off the hook. UAE, though had shown that they are a side which won't go down without a fight. Shaiman Anwar who scored the hundred was showered with praise. Anwar plays for Wings SRT Cricket Club and is employed as a store in-charge by Trotter Group, the company that owns the team. Anwar and his family earned a free holiday from his local team owner and employer Neeraj Ramamoorthy.They faced Ireland in their second game and it was a game they should've won. Shaiman Anwar became the first UAE batsman to hit a century in World Cups as his side made 278. Defending the target, Mohammad Tauqir's off-spin caused all sorts of trouble to the Irish with his teasing line and length. Ireland were four down and in trouble at 97/4. Gary Wilson though, stitched useful partnerships with Andrew Balbirnie and then with Kevin O'Brien as he took his side closer. O'Brien was though dropped en route to his 50 and that eventually proved to be the turning point. It came down to 3 needed off 6 balls in the final over with two wickets in hand and George Dockrell took the Irish home to a nerve-wracking win.Now let's see how UAE have done so far in this World Cup. They started off with a game against Zimbabwe at Nelson. They posted 285 and had Zimbabwe at 167/5 in the 33rd over. Their hopes were high at that stage of an upset win but that was thwarted by the two lefties - Sean Williams and Craig Ervine who put on a stand of 83 to take their side closer. Ervine was dismissed but Williams kept his nerve and along with Chigumbura carried his side home. UAE were beaten but not disgraced at all.Riding on Dhawan's brilliant hundred, India posted 307 and then in the field came out like a side possessed. They bowled and fielded as well as they have done for a long time. The pressure got to AB and he got run out, trying to steal a second against Mohit Sharma's arm. That was the turning point of the game and once AB was back in the hut, India just coasted home. It was a comprehensive win that sent a strong statement from the Indian side. They may have struggled on Aussie soil till the World Cup began, but in just two games, with their performances have shown that they won't give up their World Cup that easily.If Pakistan's match was about trying to keep their streak intact. Against South Africa it was time to break their jinx against the African nation in World Cups. India had met South Africa thrice in World Cups, going into their clash at the MCG and had lost all three. They were beaten in 1992, 1999 and 2011. South Africa were favorites going into this year's clash. India desperately wanted to end their unbeaten run. It set up for a fascinating clash.They said the streak wouldn't last forever. 5-0 would become 5-1. Pakistan were brimming with hope ahead of their clash with India. Misbah and Afridi were confident that they were going to change history. Nothing of that sort happened. India outplayed Pakistan and extended their streak to 6-0 in World Cups. Pakistan was made to wait once again.A warm welcome to one and all wherever you are as we welcome you to India's clash with UAE at Perth. It's a battle between David and Goliath. The mighty superpower vs the minnows. A battle of unequals. Before we go any further, let's have a look at how India have done in this World Cup so far.Zarwani lasted seven balls but later admitted to Donald he was "stupid" not to wear a helmet."The next ball was a perfect on-the-money bouncer: he could not really duck, he sort of stood up and just flinched. It really hit flush on his head. The ball almost came back to me, that's how hard it hit him. His hat fell off. Everyone rushed to him to check if he was ok. He said he was fine, picked up his bat and said he was ready to bat. Steve Bucknor, one of the on-field umpires on the day, came up to me and told me whether I knew he could not bat. 'There's no way I'm bowling him another bouncer,' I assured him. Symcox was fuming, he wanted another bouncer. I told him the game was dead, they had lost, and I was not going to bowl another bouncer."Allan Donald revisited the incident a few years back to a prominent cricket website. "When he walked in to bat he wore just a normal floppy hat. I didn't know who he was. The game was going nowhere. I had just got a wicket. A furious Pat Symcox came to me and said 'Listen, who does this guy think he is?' During the huddle Jonty Rhodes took up the fight, saying the batsman had no idea about cricket. He had come into this game without any cricketing pedigree, and had apparently promised his players that if UAE won one game in the World Cup, he would buy each a Mercedes Benz or something like that. But Jonty didn't want me to bowl Zarawani a bouncer as he thought he couldn't bat and I might hurt him. Someone else blurted out, 'Just knock his head off.' I said I'd bowl a bouncer, but make sure it went way over.Thankfully, even though Zarawani was left tottering by that vicious blow to the head, he survived. It must also be said that Zarawani was a multi-millionaire and owned more than a dozen expensive cars - probably the only player in that tournament to own that many. When anyone talks or starts a conversation regarding UAE, then the first thing that comes to mind is this incident in 1996. There is a thin line between bravery and stupidity and that day certainly, Zarawani's move was bordering on the latter. We couldn't resist bringing that incident up. It was too juicy!12:30 Local Time, 04:30 GMT, 10:00 IST: In their opening World Cup, UAE were up against South Africa in 1996. UAE's captain, Sultan Zarawani, walked out to bat without a helmet, wearing just a sunhat. Everyone were wondering why. Did he forget his helmet? Or was he making a statement against Allan Donald and Co.? Well, whatever he was trying to do, it must be said, it wasn't very brave. Allan Donald, fired up on seeing Zarawani walk out with a helmet, pinged him on the head first ball with a vicious bouncer. The ball thudded into the head and legend has it that, Pat Symcox fired Donald up by saying this - "Al, this guy's asking for it," - when Zarawani walked out to bat.Preview:The last time India played an ODI at the WACA ground in Perth, they lost their last nine wickets for 97 runs in the last league match of the Carlton Mid tri-series against England, a problem that was not looking like going away anytime soon. However, since the start of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup however that problem has been put to bed with the team going on to post 300-plus totals against the bowling might of Pakistan and South Africa.Having negotiated the two strongest teams in their group already, the next week for India at Perth poses a different conundrum, especially when they face UAE on Saturday: how to approach the game, and what are the positives they are hoping to take out of facing an Associate team that has lost both its opening fixtures.A cue to that was visible during the team's training session on Friday. While the top-order batsmen went about their usual routine of facing quick bowlers, spinners and a barrage of balls delivered by the sidearm device, captain MS Dhoni had a longer-than-usual batting session at the WACA nets.In the first session, assistant coach Sanjay Bangar sent in deliveries with the sidearm device which Dhoni negotiated with a straight bat, and proceeded onto the next practice wicket to face the spinners. He took a break after that longish stint and observed the other batsmen while having a light-hearted conversation with the media assembled towards the side, before heading up to Virat Kohli and team director Ravi Shastri, swinging his arms without bat in hand.While Kohli obliged his young fans with autographs and by acknowledging their cheers, Dhoni went back in to face the sidearm device, this time hitting the ball with the ferocity people have become accustomed to. The Indian captain has observed the team's only visible flaw during this tournament so far, which is not being able to capitalize in the last five overs of the innings, and settling for 300 when they should have got 320 or 330.With Mohammed Shami out of the game with a knee injury, India have been forced to rethink their combination for Saturday, with Stuart Binny or Bhuvneshwar Kumar the likely replacements, even though both their involvement in the training session didn't indicate as to which of the two would get the nod. While Bhuvneshwar bowled without any discomfort in his ankle that forced him to miss a majority of the Australian tour, Binny also bowled in tandem with his pace-bowling colleague before going on to have a bat towards the end of the team's practice session. Binnys performance in India's last game at Perth - he took 2 for 36 from his 10 overs - may tip the scales in his favour.India may not be losing any sleep over their opposition but seem to be addressing some of their concerns judiciously, something that may make them reconsider their decision to bat first after winning the toss. Teams in this competition have generally found it difficult to chase down totals with the exception of Ireland and Zimbabwe, who overcame UAE in a high-scoring chase, and India may want to go down that road to test themselves before facing West Indies in their next match.UAE, on the other hand, have impressed despite narrowly missing out on victories against Zimbabwe and Ireland under the watchful eyes of the Pakistani duo of Aaqib Javed and Mudassar Nazar, the team's head coach and batting coach, respectively. Shaiman Anwar's quickfire century wasn't enough for the team as captain Mohammad Tauqir lamented in his interaction with the media, saying the batsmen needed to take a cue from his efforts in order to bat longer.Tauqir, however, was positive ahead of the match and was confident of his team standing up to the defending champions, and would be proud of the improvements his team has shown in all three aspects of the game after a poor World T20 last year.India's bowlers have turned in strong performances in both their games and UAE would have their hands full against Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma on a bouncy WACA pitch. Lack of swing in the hot and windy city will encourage the batsmen to play their strokes, but a bigger threat to their batsmen would be in negotiating the spin duo of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.Probable XIs:India: 1.
