ZIMBABWE:48.6 48.6Murtagh to Panyangara, FOUR. Phew! What a superb nail-biting thriller we've had. I sometimes wonder who writes the script for these games, especially the ones between Zimbabwe and Ireland, they always tend to take it till the last overs and in the process offer us a lot of excitement. This has been yet another typical Zimbabwe-Ireland finish. Both teams managed a tie in the 2007 World Cup and who can forget that nerve-racking contest in the 2015 World Cup. Coming to the finish, length delivery on the stumps, Panyangara comes down the track and bludgeons it straight down the ground. It's a four and Zimbabwe start the series with a thrilling win against their name.

ZIMBABWE:48.4 Murtagh to Panyangara, 1 run, finally gets a single - On a good length and on off, Panyangara slaps hard straight down the ground, mid-off gets across and dives, restricts them to a single. Raza is more than happy with a single

ZIMBABWE:47.4 K O'Brien to Panyangara, 1 run, there you go again - another leading edge and I've lost the count of leading edges today. On a length and angling in, Panyangara flicks and leading edge lands well over the man at short extra cover

ZIMBABWE:46.3 Murtagh to S Raza, out W Masakadza Run Out!! 2 runs completed. Gosh! Hang on!! Zimbabwe are not home yet, looks like there is much more action packed in the last few deliveries. This was a good length delivery with a hint of width on offer, Raza makes room and goes for the loft, places it well wide of sweeper cover. There was never a third there, Raza called Masakadza through and the latter responded sans any hesitation. Ed Joyce, who has already effected a run-out, makes a good stop and hurls the ball to cover. Porterfield collects and immediately sends it to the keeper who does the rest. W Masakadza run out (Ed Joyce/Porterfield/Wilson) 10(18)Murtagh to S Raza, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!

ZIMBABWE:39.4 Andy McBrine to S Raza, out Luke Jongwe Run Out!! The last thing Zimbabwe needed was a run-out. Absolutely mindless cricket.

Nicely tossed up delivery around off, Ervine meekly looks to meet it with the push without getting anywhere close to the pitch.

One must say that the spinners were the real heros for the home team. Wellington Masakadza was very impressive on his ODI debut. Ireland bowlers will have to really work hard given that their premier strength doesn't lie in spin bowling. Do stay tuned for Zimbabwe's response...It was the Zimbabwean spinners who dictated the terms throughout. Ed Joyce and Wilson were the only notable contributors for the visitors and they would be reasonably happy with the final score. Andy McBrine played a gem of a cameo towards the end to help Ireland post a decent total on the board.4

IRELAND:13.1 Chibhabha to Balbirnie, no run, full toss on off, but such has been the approach from Ireland, too cautious. Balbirnie flicks it straight to mid-wicket
IRELAND:12.6 Luke Jongwe to Balbirnie, leg byes, 1 run, misses out on his tuck, the ball dribbles in front of mid-wicket off the thigh pad, a leg-bye sneaked in
IRELAND:12.5 Luke Jongwe to Balbirnie, no run, trying to lure the drive outside off, Balbirnie is smarter than that, lets it go through
IRELAND:12.4 Luke Jongwe to Balbirnie, no run, width on offer, shortish delivery there to be put away, Balbirnie mistimes his cut towards cover.. the ball again not quite coming on as he would have liked

IRELAND:10.3 Panyangara to Balbirnie, 1 run, angling into the pads, Balbirnie sends the flick a bit finer than he would have wanted, a thickish inside edge being the culprit, fine leg sprints across to keep the batsman down to a single

IRELAND:8.2 Panyangara to Ed Joyce, wide, angling away well wide of off, Joyce isn't interested
IRELAND:8.1 Panyangara to Stirling, out Caught by S Raza!! The two-paced nature of the track has chugged Stirling.

Panyangara will open the attackWellington Masakadza handed his ODI debut. He is the brother of Hamilton Masakadza (no, they aren't Kiwis), who was left out of the squad for this series.Teams:Ireland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Gary Wilson(w), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Andrew Balbirnie, Kevin O'Brien, Stuart Thompson, John Mooney, George Dockrell, Tim Murtagh, Andy McBrineZimbabwe (Playing XI): Chamu Chibhabha, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Craig Ervine, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Elton Chigumbura(c), Malcolm Waller, Luke Jongwe, Tinashe Panyangara, Wellington Masakadza, John NyumbuZimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe two teams last met during the 2015 World Cup and it turned out to be a memorable encounter. Ireland just about held their nerve and squeaked home by 5 runs. It had its fair share of controversies, with Sean Williams' dismissal - turning out to be the turning point. Can Zimbabwe take revenge for that loss? Toss and team updates in a while..Having started as the underdogs against New Zealand, India and Pakistan in their last three home series, hosts, Zimbabwe, enter unchartered territory. They are up against Ireland and should start the series as the favourites. On the other hand, the matches against Zimbabwe serve as useful preparation for William Porterfield's men as they look to improve their ODI rankingsChigumbura always talks about learning from past experiences and this three-match series against Ireland gives them a great opportunity to prove to the cricketing fraternity that they belong to this level. One cannot take Ireland lightly though, as they have always been a very competitive outfit. Unlike Zimbabwe, Ireland have not had much of ODI cricket this year after the World Cup and it will be interesting to see their approach.After visits from India, New Zealand and Pakistan, it is now time for Ireland to tour Zimbabwe this year. Elton Chigumbura and Co. have done reasonably well of late. They came so close to beating India in the ODIs - in fact they defeated the Men in Blue in a T20I, overpowered New Zealand and even held their nerve to beat Pakistan just a few days ago. Barring a few games, the hosts have played well in the 50-over format and could have easily had more success if they had managed to clinch key moments.
