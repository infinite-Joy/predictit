Rahim moved to his right and went with both hands but spilled it. As Dhawan was walking off after seeing the umpire raise the finger, Sarkar fires a direct-hit at the striker's end when Dhawan was out of the crease, but it won't count as it will be declared as a dead ball because of the umpire's error.

Mustafizur Rahman will open the attackWelcome back for the run-chase. The players are making their way out to the middle. Debutant Mustafizur Rahman will open the bowling with two slips.Shakib: "I think we are 20-25 runs short. We lost wickets at crucial times and that didn't help our cause. If we bowl to our potential, we can restrict them, but early wickets is the key. We are playing to our strength (referring to them playing 4 fast bowlers), we have a couple of spinners and a few part-timers. They (Tamim and Sarkar) assessed the wicket and thought that it is a good wicket, but with the way we were going, we should have got more." We are consistently seeing teams go past 300 in ODIs now, but the run-chase is not going to be a cakewalk. Can India chase this down? Join us in a short while to follow the run-chase.Sabbir perished trying to up the ante as he missed a quicker one from Jadeja. Shakib got to his fifty but threw away his wicket soon after that, cutting a short and wide delivery from Umesh straight to Jadeja at backward point. Nasir Hossain too scored a handy 27-ball 34 before Jadeja took another good catch to send him on his way back. As wickets kept tumbling towards the end, Mashrafe Mortaza hit a few lusty blows and ensured that the Tigers went past 300, the first time they have done so against India in ODIs.The rain break lasted for just over an hour and by the time play resumed, Bangladesh's momentum was gone. Ashwin, who had struggled in his first three overs, came back strongly to take 3 Bangladeshi wickets in quick succession. From 123/1, Bangladesh were reduced to 146/4. However, just when India were on top, Sabbir Rahman and Shakib took the attack to the visitors. Both of them combined well and produced an 83-run stand for the fifth wicket, guiding Bangladesh to safer shores.Bangladesh got off to a brilliant start, courtesy the 102-run opening stand between Soumya Sarkar and Tamim Iqbal. Both the openers made life difficult for the Indian bowlers as they kept smacking them to all corners of the ground. The only Indian bowler who didn't get carved all over was surprisingly Suresh Raina, who bowled a superb first spell. Bangladesh though were cruising along at a lethal pace, until a direct-hit from Suresh Raina saw Soumya Sarkar getting run-out for 54. Soon, the heavens opened up and players were taken off the field.4

It will last the distance. The toss might not prove to be crucial. It's hard and there should be good carry for the pacers. There will be some help for the spinners as well. If the captain is worried about some rain, it might be the only reason to bowl first, else bat first,' reckons Sanjay ManjrekarWeather Update: The rain has been following cricket all around. However, today we can expect to get a full game in and also if we don't, there is a reserve day tomorrow. In fact, there is a reserve day for all 3 matches. Stay tuned as the toss is not far away...Bangladesh have been in excellent form in the recent past. They first beat England in the World Cup to qualify for the quarterfinal. However, they couldn't go past India and their journey ended. After that, Pakistan lost 3-0 to Bangladesh. It was the first time that the hosts had won a series against Pakistan. Mahmudullah was the star during the World Cup, becoming the first Bangladeshi to score consecutive ODI tons. But the others started to put their hand up during the Pakistan series. Tamim Iqbal notched up two tons in the 3-match series and was well supported by the ever consistent Mushfiqur Rahim. Taskin Ahmed and Rubel Hossain provide the fire with the ball, while they can also bank on the experienced duo of Shakib and Mortaza.India have gone in with the same squad that played the World Cup in Australia, barring Mohammad Shami. Dhoni, who retired from Tests comes back to lead the ODI side. Raina, Jadeja, Rayudu, Binny, Axar and Kulkarni are also back in the side. The one-off Test was rained off for most of the days. Though, Dhawan and Rahane got to spend some time in the middle, Kohli looked scratchy in his brief stay, but when it comes to color clothing, we all know what he is capable of. The bowling will rely mostly on Ashwin, who was brilliant in the Test. Umesh, Mohit and Bhuvneshwar will form the rest of the bowling attack.Bangladesh and India met around the same time last year as well at the former's home. The visitors won the 3-match series 2-0 with the third game being abandoned. That time India had sent their second string team. Raina was the captain and a lot of players made their ODI debuts in that series. The standout performance was from Stuart Binny, the all-rounder recorded the best figures for India in ODIs. The visitors also defended their lowest score in the second ODI.Preview:Twelve months ago, the Indian contingent travelling to Bangladesh for the ODI series had as many as seven notable absentees prompting an unimpressed Mushfiqur Rahim to exclaim, "If they lose, India will lose, not India A". The naming of a full strength Indian side for the three ODIs this time around even with a hectic schedule of cricket to follow bears testament to the giant strides Bangladesh have made since then in the 50-over format.Bangladesh are far more adventurous in the 50-over format than they are in their whites. They enter the ODIs on the back of their most successful World Cup campaign where they made it to their first quarter-final (lost to India). More recently, they clean-swept Pakistan 3-0 to clinch the ODI series. A series win against India would not only reinforce their new-found standing in world cricket but also improve their chances qualifying for the Champions Trophy.The series marks India's return to 50-over cricket for the first time since their defeat to Australia in the World Cup semi-finals in Sydney. In Australia, the fast bowling stood out for its incisiveness. How the bowlers fare in the unforgiving surfaces of the sub-continent could set a precedent for the season to come. MS Dhoni and his bunch of ODI specialists have returned, will the rain do too? That remains the pertinent question.Date: 18th June 2015Venue: Shere Bangla National Stadium, MirpurStart Time: 14:30 ISTWeather: Humid with a high of 33 degree Celsius and a 40% chance of rain.Team News:Bangladesh:Over the last 6-8 months, Bangladesh have settled on a playing eleven. However, Mahmudullah's absence and Mushfiqur Rahim's finger injury is likely to throw up a couple of new faces. Litton Das, who made his debut in the one-off Test, could play as the keeper-batsman and slot in at No.3. Mominul Haque's consistent performances in Tests make a case for his inclusion too and the team management will weigh their options before finalizing the batting order. On the other hand, the think-tank will be buouyed by Rubel Hussain's return to fitness. In him, Mashrafe Mortaza and Taskin Ahmed - Bangladesh have a bowling attack that is capable of causing problems for India.Probable XI: Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mominul Haque/Litton Das, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza, Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed.India:India have travelled with a strong squad and are likely to field their strongest eleven. Mohammed Shami (ruled out with a knee injury) will be replaced by Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who has a particularly fruitful IPL season behind him. The team management will keep a close eye on the performances of the lower-middle order, most notably Ravindra Jadeja, whose credentials as an all-rounder have taken a beating following below average performances with the bat.Probable XI: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Umesh YadavStats and Trivia:- India's highest score against Bangladesh in ODIs - 370 - was scored in Mirpur during the 2011 World Cup.- India lead the 29-match head-to-head 25-3, with 1 game providing no result.Quotes:"It's not about me but as to what the team demands from me and what the situation is when I go into bat. So it will still be the same. It also depends on where I am batting"- MS Dhoni on his approach to batting in ODIs"I have told the boys to look at the statistics that we are not far behind any of the top teams."- Mashrafe Mortaza said he wants to carry positive memories into the ODI series.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Rony Talukdar, Soumya Sarkar, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, Litton Das, Mustafizur RahmanIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(c/w), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Stuart Binny, Dhawal Kulkarni, Axar Patel, Ambati RayuduLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
