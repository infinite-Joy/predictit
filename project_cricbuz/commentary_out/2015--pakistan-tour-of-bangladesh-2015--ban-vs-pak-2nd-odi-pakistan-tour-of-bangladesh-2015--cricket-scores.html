Here we go then...Welcome back. After the first innings, Wahab Riaz said that 239 is a good total on this wicket. Can Bangladesh chase it down though? Let's find out.Now, it is upto the Bangladeshi batsmen to chase this down and script a historic ODI series win. It surely will be a great contest. Take a break for now and join us in some time to follow the Bangladeshi reply.Even though Sohail fell six short of his fifty, Nasim and Riaz made sure that Pakistan end on a high. Both batsmen played really well towards the end, reaching their fifties and helping Pakistan post 239 on the board. The Bangladeshi bowlers bowled well throughout, but will be unhappy with the fact that they gave away too many runs towards the end.On a cloudy day, Bangladeshi bowlers came back strongly after Pakistan got off to a reasonable start. However, they lost their first 5 wickets in the space of 41 runs and at one stage, they were tottering at 77/5. After that Sohail and Nasim got together, putting together a 77-run stand for the sixth wicket.4

He has a chat with umpire Llong

We are going with the same team."Pitch report: Same pitch to the one which was used in the last game. A tinge of green but it should be a good batting wicket. Bat first pitch.Pakistan are unchanged. For Bangladesh, there's only one change, one that we expected. Mortaza comes back into the side in place of Abul Hasan, who was very expensive in the first game.Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Taskin AhmedPakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Mohammad Hafeez, Haris Sohail, Fawad Alam, Mohammad Rizwan, Saad Nasim, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Rahat AliPakistan have won the toss and have opted to batWeather Report: There were heavy showers overnight and the groundsmen have been working really hard to get this game underway on time. With the maximum temperature expected to hover around 30 degree Celsius, there are chances that rain might disrupt play as scattered showers are forecast for today. Let's hope the rain stays away though.Not to forget, Mashrafe Mortaza should be back for this game. He didn't play the last game because he had to serve a 1-match ban for slow over rate during their World Cup quarter-final game against India. In his absence, Shakib took the mantle of captaining the side.It's a new day today and Pakistan will be hoping to turn their fortunes around. On the other hand, Bangladesh have a chance of creating history today. A victory to Bangladesh will give them an unassailable 2-0 lead. Pakistan's defeat to Bangladesh in the last game was only the second time that they lost an ODI to Bangladesh. Both teams have a lot to play for and it will be interesting to see what combinations they use. Stay tuned for the toss and the teams.The Pakistani batters started well, but they never quite looked in the run-chase. Even though Azhar Ali produced the highest score by a Pakistan player on captaincy debut, it was not enough to take his team through. Haris Sohail and debutant Mohammad Rizwan also registered fifties, but Pakistan lost their last 6 wickets for 33 runs and Bangladesh went 1-0 up after winning the game by 79 runs. For Bangladesh, both Taskin and Sunny were the pick of the bowlers, taking 3 wickets each.Pakistani pacers gave away runs, but the spinners were the ones who were put under the pump by the Bangladeshis. Saeed Ajmal, making a return to international cricket, was thrashed to all corners of the park. He gave away 74 runs in his 10 overs. In fact, three bowlers were used in the place of a fifth bowler and they gave away 79 runs combined.Pakistan were comprehensively beaten in the first game, courtesy of brilliant hundreds from Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim. Pakistan were always behind the eight ball after Tamim and Rahim got together for a 178-run union for the third wicket. In the end, Sabbir and Shakib hit a few boundaries to help their team reach 329, their highest score in ODIs.Teams:Pakistan (From): Azhar Ali(c), Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Mohammad Hafeez, Haris Sohail, Fawad Alam, Mohammad Rizwan, Saad Nasim, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Rahat Ali, Sami Aslam, Asad Shafiq, Zulfiqar Babar, Umar GulBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, Abul Hasan, Rony TalukdarLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
