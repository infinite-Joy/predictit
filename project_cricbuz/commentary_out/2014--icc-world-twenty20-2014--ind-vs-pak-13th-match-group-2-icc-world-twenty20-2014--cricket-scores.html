INDIA:0.1 Hafeez to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit and India off the mark with a flick through mid-wicket. That was a pretty straight delivery from HafeezRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. Hafeez will open the attackOkay! The Indian openers walk to the middle as Hafeez leads his side out, we are all set for the second innings of the game! Pakistan too to open with spin and it's the captain himself with the ball in the hand!Apart from the last over, Dhoni got what he wanted from his bowlers after opting to bowl first. Never allowed the big-hitters to get going and in the end Pakistan have scored a paltry total on the board by T20 standards. Having said that, there is a lot of turn for the spinners, and when you have the likes of Ajmal, Afridi and Hafeez in the side, you should back yourself to defend these low scores. Pressure got the better of Kamran as he was run-out due to lack of proper communication. Hafeez and Shehzad hung around for a while but the introduction of Jadeja saw the former walk back to the pavilion. Mishra spun one past Shehzad and he soon accounted for Malik, who was looking set at that time. The seamers got their yorkers in and made life difficult for the Afridi. However, Shami's 14-run final over enabled Pakistan to get to 130 as Maqsood hit some lusty blows. Don't take your eyes off, an interesting Indian run chase on the cards. Stay tuned!Okay! The Indian openers walk out to the middle as Hafeez leads his side out, we are all set for the second innings of the game! Pakistan too to open with spin and it's the captain himself with the ball in the hand!1

PAKISTAN:18.4 Bhuvneshwar to Maqsood, 1 run, low full toss on the leg stump, drilled to long-on
PAKISTAN:18.3 Bhuvneshwar to Maqsood, FOUR, Bhuvneshwar just missed the length and Maqsood takes full toll of it. The key to that shot was that Maqsood went right back in the crease to convert, what was a yorker into a full ball, in the end, he has managed to murder that straight down the ground over the bowler's head
PAKISTAN:18.2 Bhuvneshwar to Afridi, 1 run, low full toss outside off stump, crashed on the bounce to long-off

Full delivery on the stumps, Akmal looked to go on-side, he swung so hard that the leading edge went straight up in the air and carried to the fielder in the deep. Crucial blow this! Akmal could have easily turned it on in the final few balls. U Akmal c Raina b Shami 33(30) [4s-2]Shami to U Akmal, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:17.1 Shami to Afridi, 1 run, Afridi wanted to smash this but Shami almost yorked him and in the end, the batsman could only drill it to long-onMohammed Shami [2.0-0-14-0] is back into the attackSo what is Boom Boom going to do now? He's having a look at the field set!

PAKISTAN:15.2 Mishra to Shoaib Malik, out Caught by Raina!! Mishra's away-spinning deliveries are always risky for a right-handed batsman to advance and loft and Malik has just found that out to perfection. Tried to send this flighted delivery out of the ground, wasn't fully to the pitch of the ball, yet he goes through with the loft and mistimes it to long-off who takes an easy catch. Shoaib Malik c Raina b Mishra 18(20) [4s-1 6s-1]Mishra to Shoaib Malik, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

PAKISTAN:14.6 Ashwin to Shoaib Malik, FOUR, in the air and Bhuvneshwar makes a mess of it.

Hints at taking a risky single and stops, that puts off Hafeez who was stranded, in the end, the bowler didn't get to the ball quickly to effect a run-out.

Well, this was a length delivery swinging back in, Akmal walked across the sticks and looked to flick, he missed and was hit high on the pad, meanwhile Akmal sets off for a run, Ahmed Shehzad was in two minds and in the end Akmal was left stranded, Bhuvneshwar grabs the ball, keeps his cool, takes aim and hits, 'baaang'. India have the early wicket they wanted. K Akmal run out (Bhuvneshwar) 8(10) [4s-2]Bhuvneshwar to K Akmal, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!
PAKISTAN:1.4 Bhuvneshwar to K Akmal, FOUR, full credit to the batsman for piercing backward point and point who are very close to each other. That takes some skill. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Akmal frees his arms and smashes it to pick up his second boundary

PAKISTAN:0.2 Ashwin to K Akmal, no run, bit of extra bounce on this flatter delivery, no one catching close and Akmal manages to defend it awkwardly behind square

K Akmal is on strike. Ashwin will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. It will be spin straightaway from India. No slip in place. The crowd goes berserk as the umpires wait for the clock to tick down. Let's play gentlemen says umpire Dharmasena and here we go.Right then, the flag bearers are walking out and will be soon followed by the teams for the anthems.Teams:India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed ShamiPakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Mohammad Hafeez(c), Umar Akmal, Shoaib Malik, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Bilawal Bhatti, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid KhanHafeez: "We as a team don't really believe in history and we are looking to change a couple of things tonight. I think it's a good pitch, the boys are looking forward to do well. Kamran and Shehzad will open the batting. We want to give a chance to whoever is in good nick. Whenever we play against India, it's an electrifying atmosphere and we are looking forward to do well."Dhoni: "I think it's the traditional rivalry that has unfolded. During the days of Javed Miandad, Salim Malik and Aaqib Javed, the rivalry was fierce, but it's good to see that it has toned down a bit. Each international game gives you confidence. We will bowl first, we are playing with an extra-spinner in this game. Can't really bank on the dew factor. We have got variety in the bowling department. The wicket looks a little soft, but a good wicket."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch report: "This wicket looks like an absolute beauty. It is nice and hard. This means that the ball will come onto the bat. 150-160 will be a good total here. The dew factor will come into play and that will reflect in the toss. Win the toss and bat first", reckons Ravi ShastriThe Indian skipper MS Dhoni honestly admitted that the bowling is a bit of concern for his side. On the other hand, if Pakistan bond well together with the bat in hand, they will be mighty tough to overcome. It's going to be a sensational start to the main tournament, with two sides kicking off proceedings. From this stage, you can almost expect high-voltage clashes almost every single game. What's the pitch like? Is it dry enough for captains to play the extra spinner? Will the dew factor come down to hamper the side bowling second? Will that play a major role in captains taking call at the toss? We'll get to know all of that in a short while. Stay tuned...When these two teams met in 2007, we had a couple of nail-biting games. In 2012 though, India emerged victors quite comfortably. So what's in store for us in 2014? Hello and a warm welcome to arguably, the biggest match of the entire tournament. It's India versus Pakistan and the excitement level is always high as ever. If we look back, history suggests that India have a psychological advantage over their arch-rivals having won all three encounters in the T20 Championship. However, Pakistan, on current form have done better than India in the limited overs format cannot be taken lightly by any team for that matter. Preview:Battered and bruised in the first quarter of 2014, India will aim to take fresh guard when they open their World Twenty20 campaign against traditional foes Pakistan in what promises to be a cracker of a contest. While form favours Pakistan even though they were battered by South Africa in a warm-up game recently, history would be on India's side as they have never lost to their arch-rivals on all three meetings of the previous editions of World T20. There will be some great inner battles within the main contest. Shahid Afridi's pyrotechnics against Ravichandran Ashwin's variations, Umar Gul's pace against Virat Kohli's bravado, Saeed Ajmal's guile against Mahendra Singh Dhoni's flair. Afridi's last-over exploits in the Asia Cup match will play on the Indian cricketers' minds ahead of the game, although the format is completely different. There would be immense pressure on both sides and one can expect a full house at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium. For Dhoni, there are a number of issues that he needs to fret upon although the warm-up game against England was an indication as to what kind of line-up he is planning to field in the upcoming matches. There are still some concerns with both batting and bowling. Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan's performance in shorter versions hasn't been good enough but the skipper is not known to tinker too much with his side. Also the fact that Ajinkya Rahane, who can be an option as an opener having done the job for Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, is also not inspiring confidence of the highest order. A good start is always crucial as it helps to seize the initiative early on in the match. Both Rohit and Dhawan would be aware that a couple of defeats could mean end of the road for India in this edition. The relief for the skipper would be his mainstay Virat Kohli's form. The team's No 1 batsman looked in great touch against England as he smashed an unbeaten 73 off only 47 balls. Dhoni's trusted lieutenant Suresh Raina is also showing signs of getting back his touch which had deserted him for the better part of the last season. A 30-odd against Sri Lanka and a 31-ball-54 against England in two practice games would certain do his confidence a world of good. Ravichandran Ashwin's form in the run-up to the tournament has been good with economical spells against both Sri Lanka and England. Ravindra Jadeja also had a decent outing with the ball against England. His terrific fielding and improved batting makes him an automatic choice. But Amit Mishra hasn't done too well in the practice games and with Yuvraj, Raina, Rohit in the team, there is a doubt whether a third specialist spinner would fit into the scheme of things. In the pace department, it will be a choice between Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Varun Aaron as Mohammed Shami is a certainty in the playing XI unless he has a niggle. Bhuvneshwar's pace has been like cannon fodder for the batsmen and has been easy pickings for batsmen of all teams. Aaron's pace is impressive but he has very little variations which can be a worry for captain during the death overs. Pakistan were all-out for 71 in their last warm-up game against South Africa but that had more to do with trying to test the batsmen by changing the order. While Ahmed Shehzad, skipper Hafeez, and the Akmal brothers - Kamran and Umar - will be itching to have a go at India, the two fear factors for Dhoni's men will be none other than Afridi and Ajmal. Ajmal's four overs with the kind of variations he possesses can create a lot of trouble for Indian batsmen. Afridi on the other hand can change the complexion of the game with both bat and ball. In Umar Gul and Sohail Tanveer, they have a more than capable right-left bowling combination, who are never easy to get away. In all, brace up for what is going to be a riveting Friday blockbuster.Teams:India (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Amit Mishra, Ajinkya Rahane, Mohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Varun Aaron, Stuart Binny, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Suresh Raina, Rohit SharmaPakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez(c), Bilawal Bhatti, Kamran Akmal(w), Saeed Ajmal, Sharjeel Khan, Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Akmal, Zulfiqar Babar, Ahmed Shehzad, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Talha, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Sohail Tanvir, Umar GulLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
