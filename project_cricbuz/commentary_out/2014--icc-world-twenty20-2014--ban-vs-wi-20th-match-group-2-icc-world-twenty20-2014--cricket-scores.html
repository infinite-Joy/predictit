I am glad that the guys got us a good total. I am always positive. It is a good pitch. I am sure our bowlers can do it."Bangladesh bowlers were disciplined, especially Al-Amin who was the pick of them all. He conceded 21 runs and picked up 3 wickets. The fielding was below par, they held on to two stunning catches but apart from that they were poor. Can their batsmen chase down this target? Join us back in a short while for the second innings.....West Indies have done well to put up a good total on the board, thanks largely to some sloppy fielding by the hosts. Could they have got more? Or will this be enough? Smith and Gayle started off in a slow manner before the former went berserk, he got to his 3rd T20I fifty. He provided the much needed momentum to the innings. Gayle was not able to time the ball and he struggled his way to a run-a-ball 48. Sammy came in and hit some fours to propel the target past the 170 mark.1

The ground seems to be full and the home team as usual have a lot of support.

A good start is important. We will not let the first game dampen our spirits. We were looking to bowl first as well. We have been playing good cricket. We will better our performance against India and play like the defending champions. It is tough to leave out somebody like Rampaul, we are playing the same team. Anything around 155 and thereabouts will be a good total here."Mushfiqur: "I think we did not play well in the last game. We have northing to lose in this format. The boys have been working hard. The wicket is pretty dry. We want to bowl first. We have 4 changes. Nasir, Razzak, Reza and Rubel miss out."Bangladesh have won the toss and have opted to fieldAnamul Haque: "Normally, I will take time and then show my shots. Cricket is a mind game. I want to play well in all formats. Planning is important. We want to get big results. We are improving and we want to play our best cricket here."Bangladesh will take heart from their win against the Caribbean boys in the 2007 World T20 Cup. Currently, Mushfiq and his men are going through their fielding drills.Ramdin: "The hard work is paying off. I am executing things well. I did not get the opportunity to bat against India. The Indians bowled well. There were too many dot balls. We were not able to rotate the strike. Bangladesh are a tricky opposition. They have Shakib, Razzak, who bowl wicket to wicket. Hopefully, Gayle or Smith can bat till the 15th or 16th over."Pitch report: "Bangladesh are used to this pitch. It is pretty dry and well bound. There is a bit of grass cover here but there will be turn for the spinners. The dew factor will come into play in the night. The team that wins the toss must bowl first because the spinners will find it difficult to grip the ball later on", reckons Sourav GangulyInjury concerns for Bangladesh: Rubel Hossain has been ruled out with a dislocated finger. Mortaza, sustaining a side strain, still remains a doubtful starter. Toss and team details to follow shortly.Santokie, with those slow breakers and cutters, was a tad predictable against India. It will be interesting to view if Rampaul earns a recall today. Hello and welcome to this Group 2 clash featuring Bangladesh and West Indies.West Indies, having floundered against the Indian spinners, will want to come into their own, for another loss, could put their title defence in jeopardy. Darren Sammy, however, has emphasized that there is no cause for panic.Instead of barging in, Bangladesh huffed and puffed to the Super 10's, suffering a shock defeat at the hands of unheralded minnows, Hong Kong. The band of spinners and the euphoric crowd support though will spur the hosts on.PreviewBangladesh: Bangladesh will look to bounce back from an embarrassing setback last week when they begin their Super-10 campaign in the T20 WC against the West Indies in Dhaka on Tuesday. The hosts crashed to a two-wicket defeat against unheralded minnows Hong Kong in a first round match in Chittagong, narrowly escaping an early exit from the tournament. Bangladesh were dismissed for 108 in 16.3 overs after being sent in to bat, with five batsmen falling for zeroes in an inexplicable collapse. They however did put up some impressive shows in the first 2 qualifiers and will know what they are capable of in familiar conditions. They come in with plenty of match practice and that should hold them in good stead. Also, what will add to their advantage will be the beating their opposition suffered in their first game and they will hope to take full advantage of any doubts that are still lingering in Darren Sammy and his team's minds. Mushfiqur Rahim and his boys have job in hands as the cricket-crazy nation would want their "tigers" to roar against Chris Gayle and company. Inconsistency has been Bangladesh's primary problem in all these years. They are brilliant in one game and pretty ordinary in others.Key to success: Bangladesh's strength lies in their spinners and their ability to make full use of the conditions. West Indies: The defending champions were dealt a cruel reminder about why this format can be unforgiving in their opening game as a clinical Indian side routed them by 7 wickets. Aware that another defeat would jeopardize their progress in the tournament, they would aim to bring their campaign back on track as they face an inconsistent Bangladesh in the second group league encounter of the T20 WC.While West Indies' campaign begun on a wrong note losing to India, Bangladesh are also not in a great position having qualified on the basis of better net run-rate having lost to Hong Kong in the qualifying round. WI just couldn't get off to a start with the bat against India with the likes of Dwayne Smith, Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels all stuttering against spin. The team management will be hoping that the game was just a one-off and that they will hit form against the host nation. Their bowlers too didn't really enough on the board to try and defend the score, but they will know that with the likes of Sunil Narine, Krishmar Santokie and Dwayne Bravo in the side, they can cause a lot of problems to any side in the competition.Key to success: It was clear from the previous game how much WI depend on their top order to come good. They will hope one of Chris Gayle or Dwayne Smith provide them with a stellar start.Quotes:It's not going to be easy to get over what happened in the last game, but cricket is full of surprises: Mushfiqur RahimIt is no need for us to panic. We have three more first round games to go in the tournament against Bangladesh, Australia and Pakistan and we back ourselves to win all three and reach the semi-finals. We are here to defend our title and we will give our all: Darren SammyTeams:West Indies (From): Dwayne Smith, Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo, Darren Sammy(c), Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Denesh Ramdin(w), Samuel Badree, Krishmar Santokie, Sheldon Cottrell, Johnson Charles, Andre Fletcher, Ravi RampaulBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Sabbir Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mahmudullah, Ziaur Rahman, Farhad Reza, Abdur Razzak, Al-Amin Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza, Mominul Haque, Shamsur Rahman, Sohag GaziLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
