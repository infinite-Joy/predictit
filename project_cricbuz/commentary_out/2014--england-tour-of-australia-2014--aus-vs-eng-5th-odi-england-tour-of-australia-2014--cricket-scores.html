McKay will open the attackEssaying an efficient exploitation of the two paced Adelaide pitch, the English bowlers restricted Australia to what appears like a sub-par total. Can Australia's bowlers make up for their batsmen's errors? They have two spinners up their sleeve who will relish bowling here. England though are extremely determined to finish the series 2-3. Welcome back for the run chase, friends..Meanwhile, the Aussie women have pulled off a nerve wracking win in Hobart with just three deliveries to spare to keep the Ashes alive.All the England bowlers chipped in. Broad and Stokes scalped three each. They have given their team a very good chance to make it 2-3. But, it is the new drop in pitch at Adelaide, so one doesn't know what a good total is. Can Australia defend this modest total or will the Poms chase it down easily? To find all this out join us back in a short while.....England bowlers have responded really well after being asked to bowl. Australia never got going, at one stage they were 3 for 43, they had lost Finch, Watson and Clarke cheaply. Marsh was looking good but he too perished to a poor shot. Bailey anchored the innings and got to his fifty in the process. He got some support from Maxwell and Wade, who got starts before throwing it away.

Meanwhile, England make a lone edit with Root replacing Ballance. It is bright and sunny at Adelaide, perfect conditions for cricket. And in Hobart, England will clinch the Women's Ashes series if they best Australia, who are chasing a daunting 269 in the 3rd ODI.Teams:England (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Ben Stokes, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Chris Jordan, James TredwellAustralia (Playing XI): Shaun Marsh, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Clint McKay, Xavier DohertyAustralia have won the toss and have opted to batCan England build on their new found confidence and ruin Australia Day or will the hosts render it a minor aberration and boss the Poms as we have witnessed over the past couple of months? A warm welcome to the fifth and final ODI between Australia and England at the Adelaide Oval. Toss and team updates coming up shortly.Having finally broken their 8-match winless streak Down Under with an emphatic victory in the penultimate ODI, Cook's men will strive hard to end their long, traumatic Australian sojourn on a positive note. As Cook reiterated after the Perth ODI, 2-3 would seem more respectable than 1-4. The challenge though gets stiffer for the touring party as Captain Clarke and ace all-rounder Shane Watson return to bolster the Aussies, who stumbled in the run chase day before yesterday.PreviewEngland's long and tortured tour of Australia is now in its closing stages as the visitors prepare for the final ODI in Adelaide on Sunday. Australia have dominated their arch rival right through the summer from the Ashes to the ODIs, before England bounced back to win the fourth game by 57 runs. Aussie coach Darren Lehmann fears England would have gained some confidence from the victory and the hosts have consequently recalled Michael Clarke for the final ODI.England: Finally, something to cheer for England. After losing five Test matches and three ODIs, Alastair Cook's men won their first full international game, thanks to some spirited cricket by their limited overs specialists. Yes, Australia had rested the biggies but that was not England's problem. Ben Stokes' all-round skills are getting sharper by the day while Ian Bell and Eoin Morgan have continued to be the most consistent batsmen for the visitors.Jos Buttler's brutal hitting towards the end as England shot past 300 will also be a huge positive as Cook hopes his side can finish the series with a respectable 2-3 margin.Key Players: Besdies Morgan and Stokes, watch out for more from Buttler. He has been terrific throughout the series and can hit those long balls at will, it seems. The bowling looks sharp with Stuart Broad and Tim Bresnan among the wickets.Australia: Rarely does a defeat go so unnoticed in Australian cricket but you could forgive observers for letting this one pass. For in Perth, Australia having already won the series had decided to rest four key players and a desperate England, eager to salvage some pride, came out blazing to register their first win of the tour.However, Australia have recalled Michael Clarke to lead the side in the final ODI. They will also be boosted by the return of Shane Watson, who was rested from the series after the first game. David Warner, Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson will be three major names to miss out for Australia on Australia Day.Even as Australia seek to inflict a 4-1 routing of England, Clarke would like to see the likes of Dan Christian and Matthew Wade make some impact.Key Players: Shaun Marsh has been in brilliant form since his come back while Aaron Finch continues to impress at the top. Watson, returning after a long rest will also be keen to do well while Clarke is always a threat with the bat. Watch out for James Faulkner with both bat and ball.Quotes:It's been a long time coming on this tour. We know the series is gone but there was a thought of losing 10-0 - the prospect was there at the start of play (in Perth). We played a pretty good game. - Alastair Cook, England captainI'm surprised that Pup (Clarke) is actually coming back after just missing one. I thought he might miss two - George Bailey, Australia batsmanTeams:Australia (From): Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Matthew Wade(w), Nathan Coulter-Nile, Xavier Doherty, James Faulkner, Clint McKay, Glenn Maxwell, James Pattinson, Daniel Christian, Steven SmithEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Danny Briggs, Stuart Broad, Jos Buttler(w), Michael Carberry, Chris Jordan, Eoin Morgan, Boyd Rankin, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, James Tredwell, Chris WoakesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
