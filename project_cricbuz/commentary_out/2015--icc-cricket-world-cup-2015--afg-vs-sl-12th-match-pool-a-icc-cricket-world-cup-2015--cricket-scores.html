SRI LANKA:47.4 Hamid to T Perera, 2 runs, this is excellent cricket from the duo. As soon as he dug out the yorker towards mid-on, he raced calling 'two, two, two.' Mid-on was on the boundary and Mendis was quick to return back for the second

Najib was in a dilemma whether to run and break the stumps or throw the ball onto the stumps, in the end he failed to hit the target. Sangakkara had given up and wasn't even in the picture. Short of a length on off, Sangakkara drops it with soft hands in front of point, takes a couple of steps down the wicket, Karunaratne also responds before sending him back.

SRI LANKA:0.1 Dawlat Zadran to Thirimanne, out Lbw!! What a start for Afghanistan! Thiri goes for a golden duck. He contemplated reviewing, but Dilshan thought it was not worth it. Perfect delivery from Dawlat Zadran. Pitched on leg and shapes away, Thirimanne plays inside the line and is struck on the back pad, the ball would have hit off-stump. Umpire Illingworth raised his finger in a flash. Thirimanne lbw b Dawlat Zadran 0(1)Dawlat Zadran to Thirimanne, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Thirimanne and Dilshan are at the crease. Thirimanne is on strike. Dawlat Zadran will open the attackDrama! Thirimanne has been given out LBW!The players are out in the centre. Thirimanne marks his guard. Dilshan will be his partner. Dawlat Zadran will open the attack. He has two slips to assist him..Welcome back.. Sri Lanka did well to pull things after the 88-run stand between Stankizai and Shenwari. Afghanistan will be ruining the fact that they could not capitalise on the start. However, it is now upto their bowlers to try and make a match of it.A disastrous batting powerplay - in which they scored just 10 runs and lost two key wickets - meant they lost their way. The lower-order then dropped anchor, before losing wickets in a hurry as they tried to accelerate in the death overs. Mathews and Malinga picked three wickets each, but Lakmal (10-1-36-2) was the pick of the bowlers. 233 should not be a stiff challenge for Sri Lanka, but Afghanistan have a good pace attack. Take a break and join us back in a short while for the run chase.Again, as coach Andy Moles said, Afghanistan batted well for 30 odd overs and lost the plot thereafter. Although they lost openers Mangal and Ahmadi in quick succession after a decent start, Stanikzai and Shenwari steadied Afghanistan with a fine fifty-plus partnership. Stanikzai also registered a fifty in the process - his 5th in ODIs. However, he threw his wicket away and Shenwari too followed him soon.4

AFGHANISTAN:49.2 Malinga to Zazai, no run, slower delivery just outside off stump, Zazai slogs and missesLooks like Shapoor has injured his knee while trying to take the run. The physio is attending to him. He's one of their key bowlers. He's ready to go now.

AFGHANISTAN:46.6 Lakmal to Mirwais, no run, full and outside off stump, Ashraf drills it towards long-off, short cover dives to his right and intercepts

Mathews on the attack, he has three slips in place.The teams line-up for the national anthems. It is the Sri Lankan anthem which is played out first, followed by Afghanistan's anthem. There are plenty of people donning the Sri Lankan jersey in the ground.Pitch Report: "New Zealand bowled out Scotland for 142 on this very surface and that is the reason Sri Lanka have opted to bowl. It has browned a bit, but there is still a good covering of grass. I think it will play a little bit better, but it will still be very tough early on. Quite short boundaries, the outfield looks very nice. We had a bit of rain last night, so it's lushed up a little. It might not be as quick as it normally is and it will be tough for the first 10-15 overs with the bat," reckons Simon DoullTeams:Afghanistan (Playing XI): Nawroz Mangal, Javed Ahmadi, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai(w), Mirwais Ashraf, Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor ZadranSri Lanka (Playing XI): Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Dimuth Karunaratne, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Suranga LakmalSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldMathews: "We had a lot of time to prepare ourselves for this game, to work on the areas that we need to improve and we have been training so hard for the past few days. I will have a bowl first. It swings a little bit early on and we are playing four seamers so we will look to exploit the conditions. This has always been a wicket that swings and seams a little bit. One change, Nuwan Kulasekara is out, Thisara Perera comes in."Nabi: "Yeah, from the last four months he (Andy Moles, coach) has joined us, he has helped us prepare well. We also wanted to bowl first because last night there was rain and the wicket was covered. There is a bit of grass as well and also the weather is cold. Hopefully, we will bat well. We have prepared well and worked on our plans. The boys have worked hard. We have one change, Aftab is not playing, Dawlat is playing today."We know that the ball swings around at the University Oval and with a bit of moisture because of the overnight rain, it wouldn't be surprising to see teams opting to bowl first. The toss is not too far away. Lot's more coming up. Stay tuned...AfghanistanOn the other hand, Mohammad Nabi's men could not live up to the expectations against Bangladesh as Mashrafe Mortaza and Co. registered an easy win over Afghanistan in Canberra. Bangladesh won the toss and opted to bat, but Afghanistan were impressive with the ball, until they met Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan as the duo added over 100 runs for the 5th wicket. However, the Afghans closed out the innings in grand style as Bangladesh lost their last 6 wickets for just 34 runs to be bowled out for 267. In their run chase, Afghanistan were reduced to 3/3 in no time and from that point, could never really keep up with the asking rate. Eventually, Bangladesh bowled them out for 162 to enjoy a 105-run win.Speaking after the match Coach Andy Moles stressed on the importance for competing hard throughout the game. "One of the issues we've had is that we do well with bat and ball for 35 overs and it's that extra 15 overs where we need to work on our concentration levels, our discipline, our execution and it's something we have spoken about regularly," Moles said.Sri LankaThe 2011 runners-up did not have a great start to their campaign as they lost badly to New Zealand in the tournament opener. After opting to bowl first, Angelo Mathews' bowlers found it tough to control Brendon McCullum, Kane Williamson and Corey Anderson as the trio scored fifties to help the Black Caps post a massive total on the board. In reply, apart from Lahiru Thirimanne, none of the Sri Lankan batsmen could make valuable contributions and eventually, they went on to lose by a massive margin of 98 runs.Sri Lanka, who have played here twice before, are tagged as favourites to win this contest and captain Angelo Mathews has said that his side has prepared well and is not taking Afghanistan lightly. "We have worked extremely hard in the past few days to prepare ourselves for this game because we have to take it very seriously. We can't be complacent and we are well-prepared for the challenge."We are at the University Oval in Dunedin today for this Group A encounter between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Both teams lost their first game of the tournament and will be keen to open their account today. First things first. There was a lot of rain on Saturday in Dunedin, but the weather has cleared up and the radar looks good for today. So, we don't have to worry about or entertain thoughts of a washout.Preview:Sri Lanka started their campaign on an abject note against New Zealand in the opening game of ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. That 98-run loss will be rankling them and Afghanistan will be bracing themselves for the backlash. Sri Lanka will have to win, and convincingly at that, against Afghanistan to regain confidence and assert themselves as contenders for the World Cup. The one-week break would have helped the team regain composure but Afghanistan will be no pushovers.Mohammad Nabi, the captain, and coach Andy Moles have emphasised on various occasions that Afghanistan are not there to just compete but to try and win games. Like their opponents, Afghanistan too come in to this game on the back of a 105-run loss against Bangladesh. The batsmen came a cropper after a decent bowling effort and Afghanistan will be gunning to prove that they are ready to fight against the big teams.Venue: University Oval, DunedinDate: February 22, 2015Time: 0330 HRS ISTWeather and pitch conditions:If the previous game at Dunedin is anything to go by, expect some help for the seamers. New Zealand bowled Scotland out for a low total but lost as many as 7 wickets in chase of a lowly 142. The short boundaries will also aid the big hitters. It is expected to be a sunny Sunday and neither team will mind that.Team news:Sri LankaNuwan Kulasekara might be replaced by youngster Dushmantha Chameera for Sri Lanka. Kulasekara went for 78 runs in his eight overs in the game against New Zealand but the rest are likely to retain their place. Probable XI: Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Dimuth Karunaratne, Jeevan Mendis, Dushmantha Chameera, Suranga Lakmal, Rangana Herath, Lasith MalingaAfghanistanAfghanistan might look at tinkering their batting order after an abysmal collapse but are likely to go in with the same eleven that played Bangladesh.Probable XI: Afsar Zazai(w), Javed Ahmadi, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Mirwais Ashraf, AftabAlam, Shapoor Zadran, Hamid HassanWatch out for:Seventeen-year old Usman Ghani played confidently in the warm-up game against India. He will like the short boundaries at Dunedin and could be the key for Afghanistan to get off to a good start while batting.Lasith Malinga will be a tricky bowler to face for newcomers. Tracking the ball will be a challenge for Afghanistan as the Sri Lankan's pacer's slingy action is nothing close to what you'd face in practice. He has blown away many a side once he finds rhythm and Sri Lanka will be hoping that he finds it against Afghanistan.QuotesYou can't take them lightly because they can upset a team, and they've got nothing to lose. They'll just come out here and try to be positive and aggressive - Angelo Mathews guards against complacencyTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews(c), Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Suranga Lakmal, Thisara Perera, Dinesh Chandimal, Sachithra Senanayake, Dushmantha ChameeraAfghanistan (From): Javed Ahmadi, Afsar Zazai(w), Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Mirwais Ashraf, Aftab Alam, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor Zadran, Usman Ghani, Gulbadin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Nasir JamalLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
