The shout was very confident from Scotland and umpire Bruce Oxenford raised his finger. The fact that Sarkar's bat was away from the thigh pad meant the sound could have only come from the bat as it passed the batsman.

BANGLADESH:0.1 Iain Wardlaw to Tamim, no run, bit of aggression straightaway from Wardlaw. Bumper on the stumps, Tamim ducks under it. One bouncer for the over says the umpireTamim and Soumya Sarkar are at the crease. Tamim is on strike. Iain Wardlaw will open the attackWelcome back. The players are walking out to the middle. It is going to be some run-chase if Bangladesh are to overhaul the Scottish total. On the other hand, if Scotland manages to win this game, it will be their first ever win in World Cups. Soumya Sarkar will open with Tamim Iqbal as Anamul Haque injured his shoulder while fieldingOn the other hand, Bangladesh have been well below par. Their bowlers couldn't maintain line and length and the fielding was average. Bangladesh's bowling in the slog overs was poor. In fact, only Shakib was able to keep the opposition batsmen in check by bowling with good control. To make it worse for them, Anamul Haque, the opener, seemed to have dislocated his shoulder while looking to save a boundary. It is a flat deck and Bangladesh can still chase down this target, but we certainly have a match on our hands. Machan and Scotland's captain, Mommsen, played with composure too. It was Machan, who helped Coetzer to construct a fine partnership of 78 after they lost a couple of wickets against the new ball. Mommsen came into the tournament on the back of being adjudged as the ICC Associate and Affiliate Cricketer of the Year for his stellar performances in World Cup Qualifiers held in New Zealand in 2014, but hasn't exactly been in good form in the mega event. However, today, he proved his worth by playing power-packed shots and twinned it by cleverly rotating the strike.Despite losing the wickets of Calum MacLeod and Hamish Gardiner upfront, Coetzer played with a dash of fearlessness. In particular, when Bangladesh's seamers bowled short, Coetzer took heavy toll of it by collecting boundaries. Ever since his debut for Durham in 2004, Coetzer is known for his ability to play horizontal-bat shots in England's domestic circuit. However, Bangladesh's seamers didn't look to bring Coetzer forward. Coetzer also showed his class against the wily spinner Shakib Al Hasan by slog sweeping him for a six. To make it a great day for Coetzer, he reached his hundred by lofting Rubel Hossain over the long-on region for a six. Once Coetzer reached his ton, he pressed the accelerator pedal and hammered Rubel for 18 runs in a single over and followed it up by thwacking Mashrafe Mortaza all over the park in the 42nd over of the innings. After composing a spellbinding knock, he was eventually, dismissed by Nasir Hossain. Coetzer now holds the record for the highest individual score by a Scottish player in World Cups. Incidentally, he is now the first player from Scotland to notch up a hundred in World Cups. He also became the first Associate batsman to amass a 150 in World Cups.On the back of Kyle Coetzer's sparkling knock of 156, and fine hands played by Matt Machan and Preston Mommsen, Scotland notched up a sizeable total on the board. Scotland's score of 318 for 8 turned out to be their highest total in the history of the World Cup. After Bangladesh won the toss and surprisingly, elected to bowl first on an easy paced wicket, it was Coetzer, who shone brightly by cracking a wide array of shots, especially on the back foot. 4

However, he then offered a simple caught and bowled chance to Sabbir Rahman and was dismissed. It was a soft dismissal, but the bowler deserves the credit for slowing it up in the air. From Bangladesh's point of view, it has to be said that their fielding has again been a let down. To make it worse for them, Anamul Haque seemed to have dislocated his shoulder, while looking to save a boundary.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 14 overs: Kyle Coetzer and Matt Machan stitched a key partnership to help Scotland make a smart recovery. Bangladesh's pacers didn't help their cause by not bowling a fuller length to Coetzer. Coetzer certainly likes to stay back. When Mortaza bowled a back of a length delivery in the 23rd over of the innings, Coetzer duly took advantage of it by smashing him for a boundary. He also slog swept Shakib Al Hasan for a six. Coetzer, then reached his fifty in just 54 balls.The players take drinks as the phyiso tends to Anamul's right shoulder. He is walking off the field. That does not look good. Hopefully, it is nothing serious.

Unfortunately, he lost his wicket to Taskin Ahmed. It was a short and wide delivery and asking to be dispatched to the boundary, but Garidner hit it straight to Soumya Sarkar at cover-point. It is up to Scotland's key batsmen, Kyle Coetzer and Sussex's Matt Machan to construct a partnership and take them to a position of strength. Interestingly, for Bangladesh, Shakib Al Hasan shared the new ball with Mortaza.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: Calum MacLeod, who has been in poor form in this World Cup started on a good note by scoring a flurry of boundaries in the first over of the innings bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza. However, Mortaza came back strongly to bowl a short of length delivery to induce a leading edge and snare his wicket. MacLeod paid the price for getting caught in the crease.Time for a drinks break!

It's the Scottish anthem that is played first followed by the Bangladeshi anthem. Mortaza gathers his men around and has a last minute pep talk before they take the field. The Scottish openers make their way out to the middle. Mortaza has the new cherry in his hand. Umpire Fry says "Let's play". Here we go...Pitch Report: "It's a fresh pitch and it's the third game here. It's a similar looking pitch as the first two games. There's a heck of a lot of grass there but essentially it is dead grass. I think what this grass will do is just help the ball to come through. There will be a bit of carry and the pitch will get better through the day. Expect the clouds to stay away," reckons Nick KnightTeams:Scotland (Playing XI): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Majid Haq, Alasdair Evans, Iain WardlawBangladesh (Playing XI): Anamul Haque, Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Nasir Hossain, Sabbir Rahman, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Taskin AhmedBangladesh have won the toss and have opted to fieldMortaza: "It was a tough match against Sri Lanka. We had a 7 day break and we had a good preparation. We will bowl first. Looks like there is moisture in the wicket and the ball will swing a bit. Hopefully, we will restrict them to a good total that we can chase down. Bowling was not upto the mark in the last match, hopefully we will come back nicely in this match. The top-order will hopefully, make a comeback. One change, Mominul is not there in the team and Nasir Hossain comes back."Mommsen: "That was a difficult one to take (the game against Afghanistan). But, we had a few days off and it is brilliant to be at Nelson, taking the scenery and get refreshed. We are ready to go today. We would have bowled first as well. But, I think at the same time it looks like a good cricket wicket. Hopefully, we can put the runs on the board and put them under pressure. That is going to be an important phase today and make sure we get through the new ball. The focus will be on the middle overs and make sure we set-up the back end of the innings. We wanted to approach every game the same. Bangladesh, we know we are capable of beating, we have beaten them in the past. So, we want to put in a good performance today. We got the same XI."Head-to-Head: These two teams have faced each other 4 times, Bangladesh winning 3 and the other being washed out. However, this is the first time they are meeting in a World Cup. So, who will come out on top? Stay tuned as the toss is not far away...ScotlandMeanwhile, Scotland started the tournament with some spirited performance versus New Zealand. After being bowled for 142, they took 7 Kiwi wickets and gave them a run for their money. Against England, they managed to pull things back after Mooen Ali's hundred, but a target of 304 was beyond their reach. Their best chance came in the previous game against Afghanistan. The two Associates were involved in a thriller, which saw the Asian side chasing 210 down, after being 97/7 at one stage. It was a heartbreak for the Scottish players.Carrying the intensity through the 100 overs has been a problem for the Associate teams. Scotland have managed to stay in the game for 35-40 overs, but have not been able to seize the key moments in the game. The bowling attack looks decent with Wardlaw, Davey and Evans bowling with a lot of discipline. Their batsmen Coetzer, Machan, Mommsen and Berrington have all contributed at some point, but are not consistent. Their next two games are against Sri Lanka and Australia, which means this is the best chance to register their maiden World Cup win.BangladeshBangladesh started their campaign with a win over Afghanistan. Fifties from Shakib and Mushfiqur helped them post 267 on the board. Then, the bowlers rolled the opposition over for 162, with captain Mortaza leading from the front with 3 wickets. Their second game versus Australia was abandoned without a ball being bowled, thanks to cyclone Marcia. The last game that they played was against Sri Lanka. Dilshan and Sanga scored tons and put the game out of their reach. Chasing a target of 333, Bangladesh folded for 240.There are plenty of concerns for the Bangladeshi side. The form of Tamim and Anamul is a worrying factor. Their dependency on Shakib and Mushfiqur to score the runs is clearly seen. They need the rest of the batters to show the application and they need to do it quickly if they want to qualify for the quarter-finals. Two wins out of the remaining three games will give them a realistic chance entering the final 8, but their next two games are against England and New Zealand. So, this is a crucial encounter for them.08:45 Local Time, 20:45 GMT, 02:15 IST: Scotland come into this game still searching for their first World Cup win. They have so far played 11 matches and are yet to succeed. This will be their best chance to register their maiden World Cup victory. They face off Bangladesh, who are the only Test playing nation they have beaten - in a T20I in 2012. That should give them the confidence when they take on the Asian side. Let us have a look as to how these two teams have fared so far in the tournament.PreviewFor Bangladesh to have any chance to make it to the quarter-finals of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, they will have to win two of their next three fixtures. After opening their campaign with an easy win against Afghanistan, they got a bonus point courtesy a washout against Australia; but a pasting at the hands of Sri Lanka would have had the ninth-ranked ODI team thinking. But, up against Scotland at the Saxton Oval, the Asian team will be hoping to stay alive in race for the knockout stage, before they face off against much tougher opponents in England and New Zealand.Scotland, on the other hand, are still looking for their first in this World Cup and after failing to clinch a thriller against Afghanistan, the match against Bangladesh provides them with the last realistic chance to open their account in the tournament, before taking on Sri Lanka and Australia. However, the Associates can take heart from the fact that it was here at the Saxton Oval that another Associate nation, Ireland, defeated West Indies in the fifth game of the competition. Also, Scotland's only win against a full-member nation was against Bangladesh in a T20I in 2012.Venue: Saxton Oval, NelsonStart: 03:30 ISTWeather: It will be mostly sunny with the temperatures vacillating between 19 and 27 degrees Celsius.Team News:BangladeshDespite the wavering forms of Tamim Iqbal and Anamul Haque, Bangladesh are not likely to tinker with the batting line-up, but they could add an extra spinner in the form of Arafat Sunny or Taijul Islam to exploit the Associate nation's weakness against slower bowlers.Probable XI: 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Anamul Haque, 3 Soumya Sarkar, 4 Mahmudullah, 5 Shakib Al Hasan, 6 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7 Sabbir Rahman, 8 Mominul Haque/Taijul Islam, 9 Mashrafe Mortaza (capt), 10 Taskin Ahmed, 11 Rubel HossainScotlandOpener Calum MacLeod has had a horrific World Cup so far scoring just four runs from three innings, and it is likely that Scotland might bench him.Probable XI: 1 Kyle Coetzer, 2 Calum MacLeod/Freddie Coleman, 3 Hamish Gardiner, 4 Matt Machan, 5 Preston Mommsen (capt), 6 Richie Berrington, 7 Matthew Cross (wk), 8 Josh Davey, 9 Majid Haq, 10 Alasdair Evans, 11 Iain Wardlaw.Player to watch out for:Allrounder Sakib al Hasan has been in good form with the bat for Bangladesh and his his left-arm spin will surely prove a handful for the Scots. For Scotland, Matt Machan and Richie Berrington have been the stand out players, and to counter the Bangladesh spinners, these two will have to bat out of their skin.Quotes:"We are expecting a full spin attack from the Bangladeshis or we're preparing for that at least," Scotland skipper Preston Mommsen."Yeah, we expect to win. When we lost, we also lost some confidence. So this is an opportunity to win this match and go with some confidence into the game against England," Bangladesh skipper Mashrafe Mortaza.Stats and trivia:The only win for Scotland against a full-member nation came against Bangladesh in a T20I in 2012Tamin Iqbal needs 10 runs to reach 4000 in ODIsTeams:Scotland (From): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Majid Haq, Alasdair Evans, Iain Wardlaw, Freddie Coleman, Michael Leask, Safyaan Sharif, Rob TaylorBangladesh (From): Anamul Haque, Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Taijul Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, Nasir Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Shafiul IslamLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
