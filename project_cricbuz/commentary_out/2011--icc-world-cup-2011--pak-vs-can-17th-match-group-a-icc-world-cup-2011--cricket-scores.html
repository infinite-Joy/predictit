CANADA:17.1  Afridi to Bagai, out Lbw!! How can so many decisions be reversed? I don't know the answer. Nor does Harper. Third one he has bungled today. When Afridi is bowling, the umpire has to be like a hawk. Afridi will forever try to get LBW's or bowl out batsmen. That's what he does. It skids off the pitch and Bagai was playing down the wrong line, Bagai was a long way forward, struck him low on the pad and the referral goes in favor of the Pakistanis. It was the top-spinner. 10th wicket for him in this WC. Wonderful stuff. Bagai lbw b Afridi 16(35) [4s-2] Afridi to Bagai, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Afridi has reviewed an LBW decision.

CANADA:16.1  Riaz to Bagai, no run, chopped a back of a length delivery to point, straight to the fielderAn interesting chat: Rameez Raja and Ian Chappell were having a fascinating chat about how Afridi keeps talking to the bowlers constantly. Ian says even the bowlers need to concentrate like how batsmen do. Rameez Raja picked it up and said Sachin was the same. Ian reckoned Sachin was far worse and wondered how Srinath did not turn around and plonk him on the head. Ian's version of why Srinath did not do so was that he was a placid character and more aggressive fast bowlers would not have kept quiet. Rameez ends with this gem: Maybe it has to do with the character of the South Indians (referring to Srinath). The million dollar question is that how does Rameez know about South Indians?It's time for Drinks and I (Srivathsa) will take leave for now. It will be Pradeep who will do the next part. Before leaving I will post an interesting conversation that Rameez and Ian Chappell had on air.

CANADA:14.1  Riaz to Bagai, FOUR!!, first ball in WCs from Riaz and it has gone for a boundary, short and wide outside off, good shot too, it was there to be hit and it was cut away fiercely past point, no need to run for those as it sped awayWahab Riaz, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack

CANADA:12.4  Razzaq to Bagai, no run, good length on off stump, Bagai comes on the frontfoot and defends
CANADA:12.3  Razzaq to Bagai, no run, sharp bouncer and probably saw Bagai coming, dragged it short and the ball flew over a ducking Bagai's left shoulder, Kamran Akmal collects and lets out a weak appeal
CANADA:12.2  Razzaq to Bagai, no run, short delivery and a slower one too, Bagai is too early into the pull and is hit on the mid riff
CANADA:12.1  Razzaq to Bagai, FOUR!!, fine shot, Bagai knows that he needs to make a move on and he shuffles across to off, flicks it wide of the fine leg man, who was way too square, much needed boundary for Canada and Bagai

CANADA:11.2  Afridi to Bagai, no run, Afridi looked pretty keen as Bagai got forward to defend and the ball drifted in to strike him on the pad, he looked at Akmal, who did not give any signal back. Afridi did not go for the review, probably outside the line of off

CANADA:10.4  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, tucked to silly mid on
CANADA:10.3  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, Is it pad first? Or bat? Definiteeeeeeeeeely Pad first says Russel Arnold on air. And we believe him. Surkari too made sure that he got outside the line of off stump as well, bat, pad jammed together too, Pak don't take the review, would have been a wasted one had they gone for it
CANADA:10.2  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, good length delivery on off stump, Surkari comes on the frontfoot and defends
CANADA:10.1  Razzaq to Surkari, 2 runs, Afridi is not happy, with Ajmal at third man, he ambled across to his right to pick it up and by that time, the batsmen had come back for the secondBowling power-play taken
CANADA:9.6  Gul to Bagai, no run, good stop to his right by Shahzad, square driven and it was going to the fence until Shahzad dived to cut it off
CANADA:9.5  Gul to Bagai, no run, Gul is bowling well with the new ball, seam movement in towards Bagai who is cramped for room and somehow blocks it back
CANADA:9.4  Gul to Bagai, no run, Bagai almost fell over in trying to play that, thankfully did not move his front leg too far across and pushed out the in-swinger to the on side, if he had missed, he was gone
CANADA:9.3  Gul to Bagai, no run, Bagai shuffles across and it is on the middle and leg stump, tapped to leg

CANADA:8.3  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, nipped back in off the seam, good length delivery on off stump and moved in, Surkari covered the line and then blocked it

CANADA:8.1  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, full delivery on off stump, Surkari gets forward and pushes it back to Razzaq with a full face
CANADA:7.6  Gul to Bagai, no run, loud shout for LBW, but a clear inside edge onto the pads this time, it moved in and was fuller on middle and leg, Bagai edged his flick onto the pad
CANADA:7.4  Gul to Bagai, no run, fullish and then seams back in, Bagai pushes forward to drive it back to Gul who fields on his follow-through
CANADA:7.3  Gul to Bagai, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, Bagai gets right behind the line and then blocks
CANADA:7.2  Gul to Bagai, 2 runs, punched off the backfoot past extra cover, a quick couple taken
CANADA:7.1  Gul to Bagai, no run, Bagai had a look at his partner and then at the dressing room before reviewing it, even the Pakistanis didn't look convinced, struck Bagai high on the pad, he was hopping back, some controversy as Afridi was not pleased with the Canadian batsmen going for the review after checking with the dressing room. Under the laws it is not allowed and Harper warns the batsmen. All 3 decisions in this innings have been reversed. Misbah picked it up and then told Afridi about it.Daryl Harper has given Bagai out. Looked to be high. Bagai has taken the review. Horrid decision from Harper as it was striking Bagai way over the stumps. Our scorer Thiru is spot on and tells me to type the commentary. He is so confident. And his confidence is not misplaced.
CANADA:6.6  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, fullish and Surkari comes on the frontfoot to push it back to Razzaq
CANADA:6.5  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, driven on the up, but falls well short of mid off

CANADA:6.3  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, back to basics, Surkari gets right behind the line and defends
CANADA:6.2  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, it was a harmless delivery, until Surkari thought about the single, thankfully wiser counsel prevailed in the end, tapped to cover, both the batsmen realised it was not worth the risk to attempt a single despite a slight fumble
CANADA:6.1  Razzaq to Surkari, no run, full and on off stump, Surkari leans forward to defend
CANADA:5.6  Gul to Surkari, 1 run, the attempted yorker, turns out to be a low full toss and it has been clipped away to fine leg
CANADA:5.5  Gul to Surkari, FOUR!!, A bit of Mark Waugh in that, not quite as elegant as 'Junior', but pretty well played in the end, because if Surkari had missed, he was gone, full ball, targetting the LBW, Surkari shuffled across and whipped it past square leg, strong and supple wrists doing the trick
CANADA:5.4  Gul to Surkari, no run, sharp bouncer, but Surkari saw that early and ducked under it pretty comfortably
CANADA:5.3  Gul to Surkari, no run, Surkari pushes forward and covers the off stump, before blocking the length ball back to the bowler

CANADA:4.6  Razzaq to Bagai, no run, defence, off the backfoot from the skipper first up, tapped to the off sideAshish Bagai, right handed bat, comes to the crease
CANADA:4.5  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, out Bowled!! That's how Razzaq used to get Sachin out in the 1999 VB tri-series. Poor shot from Nitish Kumar though. He had already gotten away with a loose drive the previous ball, this time he won't. Pitched on off, moved in off the seam, rushed through Nitish Kumar's leaden-footed drive on the up, snuck in through the gate and clattered onto the stumps. Razzaq though he is 31 years old and a seasoned competitor, has not lost his nip. He celebrates in his trade-mark style - looking at the heavens and spreading his arms wide. Nitish Kumar b Razzaq 2(13) Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
CANADA:4.4  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, no run, Oh! What a lifting delivery that is, Nitish Kumar plays with no foot-work, tried to drive on the up, missed and Kamran did well to gather it in
CANADA:4.3  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, no run, normal service resumes as Nitish Kumar defends off the backfoot
CANADA:4.2  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, no run, 2nd time that the decision has been reversed in 3 balls. This time it goes in favor of the batting side. Hit the seam and moved in to catch Nitish Kumar on the pad, caught high, above the knee roll and replays showed that it was sliding down leg and going over, good review by Nitish Kumar and he stays.Now Nitish Kumar is reviewing it. He has been given out by the umpire. Llong is the man who made the decision. It is not a no-ball. So condition 1 is out of the way. Missing. Nitish Kumar will stay.
CANADA:4.1  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, no run, solid backfoot defence from Nitish Kumar to a good length delivery on off stumpZubin Surkari, right handed bat, comes to the crease
CANADA:3.6  Gul to Gunasekera, out Lbw!! Wise review and a productive one for Pakistan too. They needed Gunasekera's wicket. It pitched around leg and was full, Gunasekera thought he had a gift on his pads and went to flick, missed, it rapped him on the pads and Harper gave it not-out, despite a loud appeal. Gul checked with Akmal and Afridi, they took it and replays showed that it was hitting middle and leg. Canada lose Gunasekera. A superb over ends with a wicket. Gunasekera lbw b Gul 8(16) Gul to Gunasekera, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Gul has taken the review. Original decision was not-out, but it will be reversed.
CANADA:3.5  Gul to Nitish Kumar, 1 run, stroked to the right of mid off, Afridi does well to keep it to a single
CANADA:3.4  Gul to Nitish Kumar, no run, punched hard into the ground and Point leaps up and stops it
CANADA:3.3  Gul to Nitish Kumar, no run, Ripper, bowled at a lot of pace, lifting, rising and straightening outside off, Nitish Kumar pushed at it, trying to play it on the up, the ball zipped past the edge and thudded into Kamran's gloves
CANADA:3.3  Gul to Nitish Kumar, wide, down leg, sharp bouncer though and flies through to the keeper
CANADA:3.2  Gul to Gunasekera, 1 run, down leg, Gunasekera got some tiny inner nick on that as he mistimed the pull
CANADA:3.1  Gul to Gunasekera, no run, to the naked eye it looked to have caught the bat, but replays show that it took the hip, jaffa of a delivery, squared up Gunasekera as it was angled across him, it missed the bat, took the hip and caught Kamran napping - he was moving the wrong way, the ball swung away and he thrust his left mitt to save some runs, sports a huge smile on his face, did not catch it though
CANADA:2.6  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, no run, full delivery on off stump, Nitish Kumar gets forward and pushes it with a full face of the bat to cover
CANADA:2.5  Razzaq to Gunasekera, 1 run, the luck is with Canada as it was with the Irish last night, back of a length delivery on off stump, Gunasekera went for an extravagant pull, across the line, the ball took the top edge and fell in between two men - Younis Khan running back from slip and Umar Gul running in from third man
CANADA:2.4  Razzaq to Gunasekera, no run, beautiful looking off drive, but Afridi is standing at a straightish mid off, easy stop
CANADA:2.3  Razzaq to Gunasekera, no run, everything is coming off the middle of the bat, punched straight to the fielder at mid off
CANADA:2.2  Razzaq to Gunasekera, 2 runs, shuffles across a tad and wrists the length ball on off and middle wide of mid on, Riaz slides and keeps it down to a couple
CANADA:2.1  Razzaq to Gunasekera, no run, good length on off and middle, Gunasekera blocks
CANADA:1.6  Gul to Nitish Kumar, no run, solidly defended off the backfoot towards point
CANADA:1.6  Gul to Nitish Kumar, 3 wides, Wasim Akram says the Pakistanis are under pressure and he is right, dreadful cricket from them, first, a poor delivery down leg, then the normal service - Kamran fumbling and then hurling in a poor throw. The worst part comes here - no backing up and Afridi and Ajmal let it go through their legs, comical and hilarious stuff from Pakistan and the Canadian team take a couple of bonus runs
CANADA:1.5  Gul to Gunasekera, 1 run, bit airy, but over the man and wide of point too, Gunasekera sliced it down to third man
CANADA:1.4  Gul to Gunasekera, no run, Gunasekera is getting behind the line of the ball nicely, pushed to mid on from the crease
CANADA:1.3  Gul to Gunasekera, no run, full and on middle, Gunasekera shows the full face of the bat and punches it down to mid on, Tony Greig is impressed with that shot
CANADA:1.2  Gul to Gunasekera, 2 runs, nice looking shot, on the pads, whipped away, Gunasekera is a Sri Lankan and that typical flourish shows in this shot
CANADA:1.1  Gul to Gunasekera, no run, Gul who clearly does not like to bowl with the new ball as he feels that he can't control the swing, and this delivery proves why does not take it, way outside off and he is lucky that he gets away with it, not called a wide, Kamran dives to his left and collects it near 1st slipUmar Gul, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
CANADA:0.6  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, no run, swing in the air and then moved in off the seam to catch Nitish Kumar's inside edge, he was looking to punch it on the up and edged it onto his front pad, a stifled appeal from the Pakistanis, but they don't go for the referral
CANADA:0.5  Razzaq to Gunasekera, leg byes, 1 run, wild slog to a length ball down leg, rolls off the pad and Nitish Kumar calls Gunasekera through for a leg bye
CANADA:0.4  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, 1 run, guided down to third man, with an open face, the youngest player in this WC gets off the mark
CANADA:0.3  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, no run, back of a length and on off stump, Nitish Kumar gets right behind the line and defends with assurance
CANADA:0.3  Razzaq to Nitish Kumar, wide, sprays it down leg, Pakistan don't need any extra runs to be given away especially when they are defending a paltry total
CANADA:0.2  Razzaq to Gunasekera, 1 run, punched off the front-foot wide of cover, for a quick single and Gunasekera is off the mark
CANADA:0.1  Razzaq to Gunasekera, no run, Razzaq comes in and bowls it full on off stump, no swing in the air or any seam movement as Gunasekera pushes forward to defendGunasekera and Nitish Kumar are at the crease. Gunasekera is on strike. Razzaq will open the attackRight, we are all set for the restart. Razzaq comes in with two slips. It is Srivathsa, who is starting off proceedings.It looks as if the minnows have decided to create an impact in this World Cup and thank heavens for that! Yesterday it was the Irish's turn to create a major upset. Can the Canadians pull off an even bigger one tonight? It won't be easy as the conditions look prime for swing bowling. It's overcast, cloudy and the prediction is for rain later on. D/L may come into play too. No Shoaib Akhtar as well and if the Canadians start off well, then they stand a great chance.The much vaunted middle order and the dangerous lower order failed as Canada surprised everyone by bowling out Pakistan. Umar Akmal top-scored with 48 but Pakistan will be terribly disappointed at having being bowled out for a measly score by a team which has been poor on all accounts until this match. Will Canada do what Ireland did yesterday? Do join us in a short while for the chase.The after-effects of the stunning Irish victory seems to have given the minnows a massive boost in confidence. Canada, who have been very poor in this tournament showed a lot of fighting abilities to restrict Pakistan to a below par total. Pakistan, who won the toss under cloudy conditions, unwisely opted to bat first. The openers struggled against a disciplined bowling attack which exploited the assistance from the pitch to full effect. Hafeez and Shehzad failed to read the conditions properly and were dismissed attempting extravagant strokes.Baidwan: We are confident about chasing this down, it has been a good effort from our bowlers. We focused on the line and length, the wicket seemed to be a good batting track, but the ball was seaming a bit. The guys made good use of it. This is our best chance so far.4
PAKISTAN:42.6  Baidwan to Ajmal, out Bowled!! That's the end of the Pakistani innings, in the blockhole, too full and swinging back in, Ajmal is cleaned up as the ball goes on to hit the middle stump. Well, the question is, Will Canada stage an upset? Are we in for two upsets in two days? Ajmal b Baidwan 0(5) Baidwan to Ajmal, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
PAKISTAN:42.5  Baidwan to Ajmal, no run, slower delivery that, more of a leg cutter, it was short as well, Ajmal looks to pull and misses
PAKISTAN:42.4  Baidwan to Gul, 1 run, fuller one, Gul drives it to cover
PAKISTAN:42.3  Baidwan to Gul, no run, back of a length and just outside the off stump, Gul misses it
PAKISTAN:42.2  Baidwan to Ajmal, leg byes, 1 run, that looked out to the naked eye, but height was the question, Ajmal was rapped in front of middle and off, hawk eye confirms that the ball was going over the stumps, the decision stays, meanwhile the batsmen have taken a singleAn appeal for LBW, turned down. Canada go for the review.
PAKISTAN:42.1  Baidwan to Gul, 1 run, back of a length and on the middle and leg, Gul clips it off his pads to mid wicketHarvir Baidwan [7.0-1-33-2] is back into the attackBatting powerplay has been taken. Only 14 minutes left, they need to bowl 8 overs. But, I'm sure Canada will wrap it up before that.
PAKISTAN:41.6  Hansra to Ajmal, no run, Ajmal gets forward and defends
PAKISTAN:41.5  Hansra to Ajmal, no run, Ajmal pushes it back to the bowlerSaeed Ajmal, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:41.4  Hansra to Riaz, out Caught by Rao at 1st slip!! The heavy thighs does the trick for Balaji Rao, that's a youtube moment! This was nicely tossed up from Hansra, lured Riaz forward for the drive, the outside edge flies to first slip, Balaji Rao, the huge lad, bends down, fumbles, and the ball was about to fall down while he decides to close his massive thighs and the ball gets stuck in-between. Riaz c Rao b Hansra 0(3) Hansra to Riaz, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:41.3  Hansra to Riaz, no run, Riaz opens the face of the bat, guides it straight to the fielder at short third

PAKISTAN:41.1  Hansra to Razzaq, out Lbw!! That looked mighty plumb to the naked eye, quicker off-spinner from Hansra, pitches on off and middle, turns in and raps Razzaq on the pad as he falls across, he misjudged the line of the delivery on that occasion and Pakistanis are falling like a pack of cards. Razzaq lbw b Hansra 8(8) [4s-1] Hansra to Razzaq, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
PAKISTAN:40.6  Cheema to Gul, no run, too full, slightly outside off, Gul is late to get the bat down, the keeper takes it low and appeals for caught behind, not givenUmar Gul, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:40.5  Cheema to Afridi, out Caught by Nitish Kumar at point!! Oh dear, what has Afridi done! It was in no way a wicket taking delivery, a full toss wide outside off, it was swinging away, Afridi reached out for it with minimum footwork and ended up slicing it straight to point, Nitish Kumar bends down on his knees to take it with fingers pointing up. Afridi had a few words with Razzaq after the dismissal, probably he asked him to stay till the end. Afridi c Nitish Kumar b Cheema 20(17) [4s-2] Cheema to Afridi, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:40.4  Cheema to Razzaq, 1 run, fuller one swinging away from Razzaq, driven nicely towards extra cover, played that pretty well

PAKISTAN:40.2  Cheema to Razzaq, no run, the keeper is standing up, pitched up outside off, Razzaq misses it, he was looking to play that square on the off side
PAKISTAN:40.1  Cheema to Afridi, 1 run, length ball, Afridi drives it to extra cover for a singleRizwan Cheema [7.0-0-27-1] is back into the attackLast ten overs, will we see some Boom Boom from Afridi? Or will he wait for a couple of overs before he lets loose
PAKISTAN:39.6  Hansra to Afridi, 1 run, flighted delivery that, driven down to long off and Afridi will retain strike

PAKISTAN:38.2  Rao to Misbah-ul-Haq, out Caught by Bagai!! Oh that's come out of nowhere! Not a delivery that deserved a wicket, flatter and down the leg, Misbah-ul-Haq uses the depth of the crease to go back, he wanted to tuck that off his pads, gloves it to the keeper, a loud appeal from the keeper and that's been upheld, it was played way down the leg stump, Misbah walks, he had no other option. Misbah-ul-Haq c Bagai b Rao 37(68) [4s-1] Rao to Misbah-ul-Haq, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:38.1  Rao to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, Misbah-ul-Haq reverse sweeps, does not get it past the man at short third, Afridi denies the singleWith that, Ajith will take you through the rest of the Boom-Booms!

PAKISTAN:36.2  Rao to Misbah-ul-Haq, FOUR!!, improvisation from Misbah! Gives it air outside off, nothing wrong with the ball, but Misbah-ul-Haq decides to reverse sweep it to the third man fence, that is his 1st boundary of the innings!

PAKISTAN:9.3  Osinde to Younis Khan, wide, slips one well down leg
PAKISTAN:9.2  Osinde to Younis Khan, no run, mistimes the backfoot punch, Younis Khan was trying to force that and the extra bounce did him in a tad

PAKISTAN:8.6  Baidwan to Younis Khan, 1 run, gets it wide of gully and gets off the mark, retains the strike with that runYounis Khan, right handed bat, comes to the creaseAnother Canadian, the captain and the keeper Bagai has gone down now. I tell you there is some jinx as far as the Canadians are concerned. Funnily Bagai twisted his ankle while celebrating Shehzad's wicket. Bagai landed awkwardly on his right ankle after coming down. Some treatment and he is fine. Another delay in play though. Rameez Raja got it right when he said that Bagai injured himself while celebrating. I thought, he was cracking another joke. I was wrong. My apologies to Rambo as he is called.
PAKISTAN:8.5  Baidwan to Shehzad, out Caught by Tyson Gordon at mid on!! Good catch diving forward. Shehzad lingered on for a while, hoping that the umpires would check whether it was a clean catch. It was. And Shehzad went after a second or two. Shehzad walked down, moved to off and the ball stopped on him, he checked his whip shot to leg and Gordon cupped it with both hands as it was dying on him. Baidwan roars in delight. Shehzad c Tyson Gordon b Baidwan 12(23) [4s-2] Baidwan to Shehzad, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:8.4  Baidwan to Shehzad, FOUR!!, once again, Shehzad shows us all his three stumps and cuts it up and over point, beats third man too, hit well as the ball was in his zone and he took full toll of it
PAKISTAN:8.3  Baidwan to Shehzad, byes, FOUR!!, When I saw Shehzad backing away, I thought he was going to pull away due to some issues behind Baidwan's arm, but hello hello, he slyly went for the cover drive, Baidwan followed him and slipped it through his bat and pad gap, Bagain went the right way to his left, but could not prevent the byes
PAKISTAN:8.2  Baidwan to Shehzad, no run, punched off the backfoot to point, it was on a back of a length outside off
PAKISTAN:8.1  Baidwan to Shehzad, no run, Bagai is standing up, defended to the on side to a length ball on middle and legHarvir Baidwan, right-arm medium, comes into the attackAn Indian born player. I'm guessing he is from Punjab as his name is Baidwan. He comes in now.
PAKISTAN:7.6  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, no run, in the block-hole, dug out back to the tall and gangly Osinde who dives to his right to save it
PAKISTAN:7.5  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, Osinde holds his hands on his head as the ball falls in front of short fine leg, flicked to him and he did not go for the catch, he had to dive forward if he had to have any chance of catching that, he did not and also did not get his body in line to save the boundary, it was the substitute man - Carl Whatham who is out there for Chohan
PAKISTAN:7.4  Osinde to Shehzad, 1 run, punched off the backfoot past extra cover, easy single
PAKISTAN:7.3  Osinde to Shehzad, no run, another one of those outies, Shehzad has a look at the curving away swinger and decides to leave it alone

PAKISTAN:7.1  Osinde to Shehzad, wide, Osinde bas been erratic and Shehzad planted his front foot across and tried his best to reach a wide delivery outside off, he could not and a wide called
PAKISTAN:6.6  Tyson Gordon to Kamran Akmal, no run, nice cover drive, but Kamran Akmal picks out the fielder at cover
PAKISTAN:6.5  Tyson Gordon to Kamran Akmal, no run, good length, outside off, left alone
PAKISTAN:6.4  Tyson Gordon to Kamran Akmal, no run, pushed to cover as Tyson Gordon gets one fuller in the channel
PAKISTAN:6.4  Tyson Gordon to Kamran Akmal, wide, poor one to begin, way down legTyson Gordon, right-arm medium, comes into the attackOh dear! What has happened here? Chohan ran in gingerly and pulled out of the delivery stride. He is holding his right thigh. He has gone down and the physio is out there. Waz on air says: That's serious, he will be ruled out at least for 3-4 weeks. A slight hold-up in play. Chohan is walking off the field along with the physio. Not good news for Canada. Chohan was bowling a tidy and a probing spell. It seems this WC is jinxed for the Canadian bowlers. I remember how so many of them went off during their first game. Back home it is cold and they are not used to these hot and humid conditions here in the sub-continent. Anyway here is Tyson Gordon to complete the over.
PAKISTAN:6.3  Chohan to Kamran Akmal, no run, Nitish is kept busy at point, punched off the backfoot this time
PAKISTAN:6.2  Chohan to Kamran Akmal, no run, Bagai is now up to the stumps, the length is the same, same shot, same result

PAKISTAN:5.4  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, no run, again draws Kamran Akmal forward with a well pitched up delivery on off stump, Kamran Akmal stumbles out and the thick outer edge rolls to point
PAKISTAN:5.3  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, no run, lovely comeback from Osinde, Kamran Akmal was caught in no-man's land, his feet got stuck in quick sand and the beautiful outswinger moved past his flat footed drive and went to the keeper, almost got a wicket, close to the edge
PAKISTAN:5.2  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, cracker, short of length outside off, Kamran Akmal got on top of the bounce and cut that hard past the off side cordon, no one moved, a fine shot to get off the mark, that's his area, square of the wicket, very strong is Kamran Akmal and he shows us his strengths
PAKISTAN:5.2  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, wide, swing, but that should start on middle, not well outside off, and it is moving further away, wide called
PAKISTAN:5.1  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, no run, Kamran Akmal once again has a nervous poke at a short and wide delivery outside off, the angled bat, produces a bottom edge that goes on the bounce to Bagai
PAKISTAN:5.1  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, wide, that would have been a wide in a test match, way over the head and Bagai did well to leap high and haul it back in, otherwise it would have cost Canada more runs
PAKISTAN:4.6  Chohan to Shehzad, no run, good fielding from the 16 year old - Nitish Kumar - the youngest player in this WC. Cut hard into the ground and Nitish at point makes a sharp save moving to his right swiftly

PAKISTAN:4.4  Chohan to Shehzad, FOUR!!, Chohan floated that up and full outside off, tempting Shehzad to go for the cover drive and Shehzad obliged, leant forward and bisected the gap between cover and mid off with a flowing drive, the quick outfield does the rest
PAKISTAN:4.3  Chohan to Shehzad, no run, good fielding at silly mid on, dived to his left and cut that punch off the backfoot
PAKISTAN:4.2  Chohan to Shehzad, no run, swing for Chohan, who looks like a side-arm version of Kulasekara, Kula is a front-on bowler and Chohan is getting swing from that side-armish action, Shehzad covers the swing and defends it off the backfoot
PAKISTAN:4.1  Chohan to Shehzad, no run, short of length on off stump, Shehzad pushes it back to Chohan from the crease
PAKISTAN:3.6  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, no run, short and wide outside off, cut hard into the ground and straight to the fielder at backward point
PAKISTAN:3.5  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, no run, tapped to the left of point and Kamran Akmal wants the single, Shehzad is not willing and sends him back

PAKISTAN:3.2  Osinde to Kamran Akmal, no run, back of a length and bounced too, moved in towards off stump, Kamran Akmal barely kept that out, hopped back to defend and the inner edge rolled back near his feetKamran Akmal, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:3.1  Osinde to Hafeez, out Lbw!! First blow for Pakistand and it is the Ugandan - Osinde who strikes. Hafeez has this tendency of falling over in trying to work balls on his pads and the same thing happens here again. Pitches on off and moves in off the seam to strike Hafeez above the knee roll, he missed the clip to leg and replays showed that it was just clipping the top of middle and leg. So the original decision stays. Not before the third umpire took a lot of time to make the decision. Hafeez tried to fool the umpire by showing his bat and pointing out that he got an edge onto his pad. But Harper was spot on. Pakistan lose a review. Hafeez lbw b Osinde 11(12) [4s-2] Osinde to Hafeez, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Hafeez has been given out LBW. He is reviewing it. Daryl Harper has given it out. Not a no-ball. So one condition out of the way. Struck high on the pads, above the knee roll. No inside edge onto the pads as well. Harper had a look at it and gave it out. The third umpire is having a long and hard look, numerous replays being shown. He is still looking and Hafeez has to go.
PAKISTAN:2.6  Chohan to Shehzad, no run, swung back in after pitching on off and Shehzad drove it back to Chohan who hurls the ball back at the batter in anger
PAKISTAN:2.5  Chohan to Shehzad, no run, bit of an extra lift off the deck and Shehzad goes on the backfoot to defend it to silly mid on
PAKISTAN:2.4  Chohan to Shehzad, no run, that one snaked back in and bounced a tad, seam movement off the deck and hits Shehzad in the abdomen area, he was trying to work it to leg and missed

PAKISTAN:1.5  Osinde to Hafeez, 1 run, Hafeez gets forward and steers the length ball towards third man with an open face
PAKISTAN:1.4  Osinde to Hafeez, no run, much better, in the channel, swung away too, left alone
PAKISTAN:1.3  Osinde to Hafeez, FOUR!!, same shot and same result, but more emphatic and powerful than the previous one, hit hard and pulled over square leg with disdain, again banged in too short by Osinde, who clearly needs to learn from his errors
PAKISTAN:1.2  Osinde to Hafeez, FOUR!!, too short on off stump, Hafeez had no trouble in putting that away, swiveled and then pulled it over square leg, this is a slow pitch and you need pace if you have to bowl short on this and Osinde does not have the express pace of a Lee or a Tait to trouble the batters
PAKISTAN:1.1  Osinde to Hafeez, no run, the Uganda born Osinde comes in and starts well, back of a length delivery outside off, rising too, Hafeez shoulders armsHenry Osinde, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackWasim Akram tells us an interesting nugget about Chohan: Chohan was born in Pakistan and used to train with the Pakistani side some 12 years back. Wasim Akram met him during breakfast early this morning and Chohan reminded him about those days. Waz says he was quite nippy back then and used to swing the ball well. Chohan then moved to Canada and is now playing for them.
PAKISTAN:0.6  Chohan to Shehzad, no run, in the channel outside off, left alone
PAKISTAN:0.5  Chohan to Hafeez, leg byes, 1 run, swing in the air for Chohan, it pitched on off and moved towards leg stump, Hafeez was falling over in trying to clip that to leg, would've comfortably slid down the leg side

PAKISTAN:0.2  Chohan to Shehzad, 1 run, caught at third man off a free hit, Shehzad cleared his front leg and carved it high and towards third man, a good lunging catch as the fielder came forward, it won't count as it came off a free hit
PAKISTAN:0.2  Chohan to Hafeez, no ball, 1 run, risky single, and that too off a no-ball, tapped to square leg and if the fielder had hit, Shehzad might have been in trouble, he missed and Shehzad got away, free hit coming up as Chohan lands his front foot way beyond the front line
PAKISTAN:0.1  Chohan to Hafeez, no run, first ball from Chohan - a Pakistani, to another Pakistani - Hafeez. Good length delivery on off stump, hint of inward movement towards off stump and Hafeez gets forward to defendHafeez and Shehzad are at the crease. Hafeez is on strike. Chohan will open the attackAlan Wilkins on air tells us the composition of the Canadian team: 4 Pakistanis, two Indians, a West Indian, a Sri Lankan and Henry Osinde - who was born in Uganda. Quite a colorful mix the Canada team and a tribute to their multi-culturalism.The weather forecast is for 60% thunderstorms later in the day, but as Harsha Bhogle tells us, they said the same thing when Sri Lanka took on Pakistan the other day too. So we won't take that too seriously and get on with the business. The anthems are on, first up is Canada's and then the Pakistani's. Lots of empty seats in the stadium - it is expected for the home side are not playing. A beautiful melody too - the Pakistani national anthem.Teams:Canada (Playing XI): Nitish Kumar, Ruvindu Gunasekera, Zubin Surkari, Ashish Bagai(w/c), Rizwan Cheema, Jimmy Hansra, Khurram Chohan, Henry Osinde, Balaji Rao, Harvir Baidwan, Tyson GordonPakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Umar GulPakistan have won the toss and elected to batBagai: We would have batted first as well. Davison is not playing, he has picked up an injury. Osinde is in. We would like to shuffle our batting order and try and play well.Afridi: We are batting first. We will decide on the target based on the start that we get. Ajmal and Wahab Riaz are in. Akhtar is not 100% fit and Rehman is not playing.Hafeez: We are not complacent, we can't take any team easy. We are looking forward to win this. We wanted to win against SL, they are a very good team and that has given us a lot of confidence. I would look to play much better this time around.Pitch report: This is a dry pitch, a new one, there won't be any sideways movement. There is not much grass, the wicket may assist spin later on. The team that wins the toss should have no doubts about batting first feels Ian Chappell.Younis Khan: I was pretty young when I played my first WC in SA in 2003. There were some controversies during the 2007 edition. Now, I am pretty matured and I am not putting any sort of pressure on myself. I have played for Pakistan for a lot of time and have been involved in some wonderful moments such as winning the T20 WC. I am enjoying playing alongside with this team, I know what is expected of me and I am striving to contribute. I want to retire on a high, myself, Misbah and Shahid are very close to each other, we enjoy each others' company.It would take something special or close to a miracle for this Canada side to upset the Pakistanis. We will see as we have a lot of things coming up as we begin the coverage. Here is Younis Khan's interview just as the players are warming up.A good afternoon to one and all. After a stunning win by the Irish last night against the English, the minnows cannot be taken lightly. Canada who have had a forgettable tournament so far, would have been inspired by the Irish's efforts last night and would like to replicate their efforts. But they are up against a Pakistan side who are the dark-horses of this World Cup. They have won two in a row and beaten Sri Lanka on their home soil.By Vishaal LoganathanPakistan look to have put their recent troubles behind them and turned in performances of the highest order while their opposition Canada have so far had a campaign to forget with sub par performances. A win against Canada would push Pakistan on top of group A, while Canada would do well to make Pakistan fight for a win.Team News:Pakistan: Pakistan's form in the World Cup has been refreshing for many fans, especially those who feared a repeat of the 2007 performance where they were shot out in the first round. That result looked extremely bleak given the format of this World Cup but there were still fears that the team could be humiliated. They quashed those fears with a disciplined show against Kenya and they backed that up with a terrific performance against tournament favourites and co-hosts Sri Lanka.
The Pakistan batting line up relies heavily on the two experienced batsmen in the middle order; Younis Khan and Misbah ul Haq have been in great form and have been instrumental in their two victories. The duo combined well in the both the matches against Kenya and Sri Lanka helping their side to a competitive total. Their lower order is packed with power hitters and game changers; Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi and Abdul Razzaq have the ability to destroy any attack in the world and Canada would be wary of that.
Even with the absence of Mohd. Aamer and Mohd. Asif Pakistan can boast of one of the most dangerous blowing attack in the World Cup. Shoaib Akthar has been a thorn for many sides with his pace, while Razzaq's laid back approach to bowling can be deceptive. Umar Gul too has the experience behind him to come good and along with spin trio of Afridi (who is the tournament's leading wicket taker), Mohd Hafeez and Abdur Rehman/Saeed Ajmal the bowling attack could be too much to handle for Canada.Canada: Canada's performance in the World Cup has so far been the opposite of Pakistan's. They have been humiliated twice already in the tournament and a third looks unavoidable.
Their batsmen have struggled to put on runs and have been skittled out twice for less than 125 twice in a row. Rizwan Cheema has been the only player to show some kind of fight but they will need more players to pull up their socks and do a better job if they hope to trouble an in-form Pakistan.
Their batsmen would do well to take a leaf out of the Kenyan innings, against Sri Lanka when the Obuyo brothers took their time to construct the innings before the lower order crumbled and were skittled out. Balaji Rao, Khurram Chohan, Harvir Baidwan had a good outing with the ball against Zimbabwe and will look to repeat their performance.Head to head:Pakistan and Canada only played each other once, way back in 1979 when Pakistan won by 8 wickets.Quotes:I am keeping myself ready in the nets so whenever the team needs me I will be playing my part and do my job of lifting the run rate: Abdul RazzaqMy father wanted me to play at the highest level and where I am now is because of him, my family and my coach. Without them, I'd be lost. There was a time when I would play for myself, but now I play for my father: Nitish KumarTeams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Gul, Abdur Rehman, Asad Shafiq, Shoaib Akhtar, Junaid KhanCanada (From): John Davison, Nitish Kumar, Ruvindu Gunasekera, Ashish Bagai(w/c), Zubin Surkari, Rizwan Cheema, Jimmy Hansra, Tyson Gordon, Khurram Chohan, Harvir Baidwan, Balaji Rao, Parth Desai, Henry Osinde, Hiral Patel, Karl Whatham, Hamza TariqLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
