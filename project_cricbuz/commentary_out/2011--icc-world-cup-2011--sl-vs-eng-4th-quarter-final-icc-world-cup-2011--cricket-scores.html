SRI LANKA:0.1  Bresnan to Tharanga, no run, good first ball from Bresnan, good length and bit of seam movement into Tharanga, too close to cut and the chop on does not go back to the off stump, instead it rolls to the off sideTharanga and Dilshan are at the crease. Tharanga is on strike. Bresnan will open the attackRemember chasing at the Premadasa under lights has never been easy. The ball does a bit and there is the small matter of a knock-out game, which will only put more stress on the home side. Pressure, who handles it better will win tonight. My bet is on England winning by 12 runs. Let's see as I, Srivathsa take you through till the first drinks break.Alright, we are set for the chase. The Lankan openers walk out. The England team are in a huddle. Sir Ian finds the England huddle a bit strange, he reckons that they should have done all the team-talk inside the dressing room. Tim Bresnan has the new nut. Tharanga is on strike. A lone slip in place.England have been the side that have provided the tournament with all the TRPs. All the 6 league games that they played provided heart-breaking moments to all their fans as each game proved to be a humdinger. Will today's game follow the same script? Or will Sri Lanka canter home to the semis? We'll know when the chase starts in a while. Rest assured, it will be a tough chase. Yesterday the South Africans capitulated under pressure and England have a better attack than the Kiwis. The key thing is to take wickets with the new ball. Dilshan if he gets in will score quickly. But don't go anywhere for you know never are sure what happens when England play.Morgan: The part of my game was to manipulate the field and bat well with Trott. The wicket is turning and a bit unpredictable, and I guess we have got a competitive score. We need to be disciplined in the bowling if we do so, we can win this! We would like to take our catches and field well too. The variations from the spinners were tough to pick today.Both teams would have mixed feelings going into the break. Choosing to bat, England had a poor start as the openers didn't last long. The spinners strangled the top order for a while but Trott and Bopara put on a patient partnership before the latter fell to Murali. In came Morgan who looked positive right from the word go. The Lankans were generous in the field and dropped him thrice as both Trott and Morgan completed their fifties in quick time. Just when the game was shifting towards England, the World Cup's best bowler came on - the batting power-play! Morgan and Swann fell in successive deliveries as Sri Lanka pulled things back. England failed to make good use of the death overs but managed to put up a competitive total of 229/6. Remember that South Africa couldn't chase down 222 yesterday. Will Sri Lanka chase this down? Join us in a while to find out..4

ENGLAND:44.6  Malinga to Trott, no run, too full again Trott defends it to the off sideInterestingly, one of the batsmen has asked the umpire, Mr. Simon Taufel, to remove his hat.

Malinga is marking his run up and the trumpets have started to make their presence felt, so have the bugles. The English would want to get off to a good start, they have had many close games coming into this game. Alright, let the game begin.Alright folks, it is time for the anthems. There will be one more game here in Colombo, the semi final. The crowd would want to see Sri Lanka feature in that game, and for that, they need to overcome the unpredictable English side. First up is the English anthem, the guys looked pumped up. The melodious Sri Lankan anthem - Namo Namo Maatha - follows. Remember, there is some rain expected. Will the D/L method come into play? Will there be a full game today? Lots of questions surround and it will be me - Ajith - with you for the first 15 overs.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Silva, Angelo Mathews, Ajantha Mendis, Muttiah Muralitharan, Lasith Malinga, Rangana HerathEngland (Playing XI): Andrew Strauss(c), Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Luke Wright, Matt Prior(w), Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, James Tredwell, Chris TremlettEngland have won the toss and elected to batSangakkara: We have got the combination to do well, we are not giving it away easily. It is 50-50 on the toss, we can't do much on the toss, we have got Kulasekara out, and we want to go in with 3 spinners. Spin is our strength, and we would like to go strong. Murali is 100% fit.Strauss: We are going to have a bat, looks like a dry wicket, it would be better to make the first use of it. We are going in with the same team, there is some good balance with two spinners and we are hoping for some reverse swing. Bell will open with me. We thought Prior can take advantage of spinners later on, and that's the reason why he is batting down the order. We are fresh and mentally ready, there will be no excuses after this game.The news that is doing the rounds at the venue is that England are unchanged which means Anderson isn't playing. Let's find out, the toss is underway.Pitch report: This is ODI No. 100 at the Premadasa Stadium, a year ago, the wicket and the entire ground has been raised by 4 feet so that the pacers get a bit more bounce and seam movement. The deck is flat and it will get slower and lower as the game progresses, don't take any chances, win the toss and bat first says Sir Ian Botham.Weather report: Well, they have predicted rain and thunderstorms today, there was a bit of rain a day ago and earlier this morning. Right now, the sun is out and there are scattered clouds. Let's hope it stays that way. Max temp: 31 deg and humididy: 51%From Dhaka to Ahmedabad, back to Dhaka and now to Colombo, the World Cup has travelled across the sub continent and we are here for the 4th and the final quarter final of this 2011 World Cup. A warm welcome to one and all, it is Sri Lanka taking on England; home advantage for the Lankans but along with that the injuries and the loss of players for different reasons, England are surely the underdogs going into this game. This is Ajith, I'll be taking you through the day along with Sid V and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be right back with more updates.Preview by Saurabh SomaniThere are no favourites in the 2011 World Cup. If anyone needed proof even after seeing England lose to Ireland and Bangladesh but beat South Africa, the third Quarter-final between New Zealand and South Africa confirmed it. The heavily favoured Proteas failed to win their fifth straight World Cup knock-out match. And this loss came against a team that had been blanked by Bangladesh not too long ago.
Thus although Sri Lanka enter into the final quarter-final as the team more favoured to win, the 'favourite' tag will not mean much. Especially against England - the dream script-writers of this edition. The first six matches involving England have all been thrillers. Purely from the point of view of drama, they should reach the finals to guarantee another thrill-a-minute ride.
The venue of the match is bound to cause some discussion, since the R Premadasa at Colombo has often - and with reason - been accused of unfairly favouring the team batting first. Thereby, the toss becomes a critical factor, and in a knock-out game in the World Cup, that is not desirable.Sri Lanka: At home, Sri Lanka are an extremely tough side to beat. Their batsmen and bowlers have always seemed to find the home pitches very well suited to their craft. Sri Lanka began the World Cup with one glaring weakness, and they enter into the knock-outs with that weakness unresolved. The middle order still looks weak and doesn't inspire confidence in the event of a top order collapse. Apart from that though, they have their bases covered. The top order oozes class, though Sri Lanka could do better with a few more runs from Mahela Jayawardene and Dilshan, who have been brilliant at times but lacked the sustained consistently excellent performances that Sangakkara has delivered - especially against the best quality attacks. Dilshan has made 41 and 4 against Pakistan and Australia, while Mahela has made 2 and 23 against the same opponents. Sangakkara, in contrast, made 49 against Pakistan and was on 73 not out when the Australian match was washed out. To cover for the weakness of the middle order, Sri Lanka's two senior pros need to bring their top game against another top team.
Sri Lanka's bowling, as ever, is full of variety and sting. There is Lasith Malinga, who was absent against Pakistan, and the ageless Muralitharan. And the back up Kulasekara and Mendis/Herath is well above average.England: In spite of being a couple of overs of sensible West Indian batting away from a flight home, England deserve to be in the last eight of the tournament and even have a serious shot at upsetting Sri Lanka. A startling statistic about their campaign is that they are the only Quarter-finalists who haven't lost a match at the World Cup to any of the other 7. In this World Cup at least, a clear pattern has emerged with England lifting their game against the top sides and then losing the plot against the weaker teams.
The key to England's fortunes in this match is likely to be Eoin Morgan, who is their best bet to counter Sri Lanka's spin. The top order of Strauss, Trott and Bell will also have key roles to play. However, in much the same way as with Sri Lanka, England also have an over-dependence on these four to deliver, and if they don't the side will be in trouble.
England's bowling is a lot less settled than Sri Lanka's, with their chief worry being the sudden desertion of form that James Anderson has experienced. He has been their spearhead for a while, but was so bad that he had been dropped from the starting eleven. He could well be back for this game, given that Ajmal Shehzad has also had to return home with injury. That has been another of England's problems - they are possibly the squad to have been most severely hit by injuries. However, they have good spin options in Graeme Swann and James Tredwell and that should hold them in good stead for the spin friendly conditions they are likely to encounter.The Offies battleThis match will pit the greatest off-spinner in history against the man who is the best spinner in the world at present. Muttiah Muralitharan and Graeme Swann will both be their respective captains' go-to men. Both will be expected to control the middle overs and strike when necessary. Who does so most effectively could well determine how this match goes.Quotes:"The key, like it always is, to get your nose in front of the game and the pressure is big, especially at this stage of the World Cup." - Andrew Strauss aims for an early advantage in the match.
"I think it will be there (pressure), but that kind of thinking goes out of the window when you cross the boundary rope. I am sure players will feel the crowd, they'll lift themselves and do well." - Kumar Sangakkara downplays the pressure of carrying huge expectations.
