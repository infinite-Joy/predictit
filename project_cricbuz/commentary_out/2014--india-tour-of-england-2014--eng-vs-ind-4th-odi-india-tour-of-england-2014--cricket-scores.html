We will find out as the England players disperse after being in a huddle. Jimmy to kick-start proceedings. He has two slips to assist him...1996 Third Test, Trent Bridge - Match DrawnThe batsmen made merry on a flat pitch at Trent Bridge. Batting first, India finished their first innings with 521 runs. Sachin Tendulkar(177) and Sourav Ganguly(136) put on a show this time, blending caution with attack. England trumped India, engineering a better display, making 564 runs with Atherton and Hussain scoring well-crafted half-centuries. Having, gotten to his second century of the series, Hussain staked claim for a permanent berth at Number 3. Unfortunately he had to retire before the start of day 4 as X-rays revealed a hairline fracture in his finger. The lower order also played its part in fattening the total.India's second gig was a far cry from the first. The debutant Malk Ealham's nippy seam movement broke the back of the Indian batting with a 4-fer. Sachin Tendulkar waged a lone war before the match ended in a draw.Once the Indian fast bowlers got the early wickets, the spinners came on and took control of the game. Ashwin, Jadeja and Raina scalped 4 wickets between them. The fielding was at its best. The visitors were electric in the field and Raina led from the front, with a terrific catch and a superb direct-hit. The target of 207 should not cause much worry to the strong Indian batting line-up. Can they win their first bilateral series in England since 1990? Or will England come up with a strong bowling performance? Join us in a few minutes to find out. Before we go here is part 41 of our detailing of the England-India Tests in England.Three times in as many games, England have been bowled out. If it were the spinners at Trent Bridge, then it was the pacers who did most of the damage in this game. Bhuvi started the slide when he got rid of the openers in the space of 4 deliveries. Shami then sent the in-form Ballance back cheaply. Morgan and Root started the repair work by adding 80 runs for the fourth wicket, but both went in quick succession. Moeen Ali came in and provided the momentum. He looked at ease against the spinners as he brought up his 2nd ODI fifty. If his innings is taken out, then the hosts would have struggled to get 200.4

ENGLAND:18.3 Shami to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, lovely looking front foot drive, with an open face and well-timed by Eoin Morgan. If not for the bad bounce, Jinks would've stopped it at cover. Full marks to Rayudu too for that effortHas Rayudu saved the boundary? Bad bounce initially for Jinks at cover, the ball rolls under his body and a sliding stop by Rayudu, who looks to have saved a run for his side. Or has he? The tv ump is having a look at various angles. First look, it seemed it was a clean stop. But the next angle shows Rayudu's foot in contact with the ropes. So it's a four.

ENGLAND:7.6 Shami to Ballance, out Caught by Rahane!! Shami has got Ballance out and the hosts are struggling now. Too early into the flick, off the toe end and the leading edge loops to cover.

ENGLAND:5.6 Shami to Ballance, 1 run, tight single to wide mid-off and it would've been interesting with a direct hit. I guess Ballance might have made it, he ran as soon as he hit that

Sharp catch at gully, the width was there for the cut, but he couldn't keep it down, it went low to the safest catcher in the Indian team and Raina didn't make a mistake.

Hales b Bhuvneshwar 6(7) [4s-1]Bhuvneshwar to Hales, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

ENGLAND:2.3 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, no run, beaten as Cook fishes tentatively outside off, it just angled away and Cook played a nothing shot

Cook isn't ready, so he has to go back and begin all over again. Will it swing? We'll know very soon. Here we go.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Dhawal KulkarniEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Alex Hales, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Steven Finn, James Anderson, Harry GurneyCook: "We were looking to bat first. We have 3 changes. Bell got hit on the foot this morning and has a sore toe. Ballance comes in. Great opportunity for a man in form. Moeen comes in for Tredwell. Gurney replaces Stokes. The cricket we have played over the last six months has been good. Tredwell is very unlucky but we have to have a look at Moeen. He gives us another option. It looks a good wicket. It can get slower and lower but for that we have to put runs on the board.Dhoni: "We are looking to bowl first. It looks a good wicket. We have played here before. As a team we have fond memories. Maybe it will help the spinners. Overall, it may slow down later. Mohit is not 100% fit. Dhawal will make his debut."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldBat first? Or bowl first? We shall find out as Cook and Dhoni walk out for the toss.Sunil Gavaskar though disagrees with Sanjay Majrekar's views, saying that it is a bowl first pitch.The news is that Ian Bell limped off the field after the warm-up session. Dhawal Kulkarni was presented his cap early on, meaning that he will make his debut today. Mohit suffered a calf strain at TB. Is he the one missing out? We will keep you updated.Pitch report: 'It feels very warm. Looks like a great cricket day. Some grass has been taken off but there is more grass on this pitch than on the one used for the Champions Trophy. It might start turning later on. The captain winning the toss may be tempted to bat first as the pitch appears hard. It will get more sun. Biscuit brown is the color of the pitch. Early on, it might do a little bit, it is a pitch where you won't mind batting first' reckon Sanjay Manjrekar and Alan Wilkins.Weather watch: A sunny day has been forecast. The weather is not much of a threat as far as this match is concerned.Alright, that's a wrap of this section. If the pitch is slow, then England will have to brace themselves for another spin assault from Ravi Ashwin and Co.'It is a different ball game when the ball turns. Then they are creasebound and terrified to use their feet against the spinners. Since Graeme Swann retired we have played Moeen Ali a batsman who bowls spin, more of a one-day cricketer really. He has done quite well but who else is in the frame? Nobody. James Tredwell is a good experienced bowler but he is not being threatened by any young spinner because there are not any coming through.'He says, 'It is quite clear why England are struggling in one-day cricket at the moment: they cannot play the turning ball. We are playing the world champions, India, and we bat like chumps.'Geoffrey Boycott, writing for the Telegraph UK, explores England's spin tangle.'England mustn't fall into the trap of previous World Cup when the carefully laid plans that had been in place were suddenly ripped up just a few weeks before the tournaments began.'The former England captain pens, 'Overcautious and unadventurous, repeating mistake after mistake. Watching England in this current series is exactly how England played back in the mid 1990s. England have to understand that the game has moved on and must be prepared to play a style of cricket that will worry the oppositon. Any call for Cook to stand down will fall on deaf ears and I can understand why the selectors won't change things with just a few months to go before the World Cup starts.'Alec Stewart, writing for the Daily Mirror, delves into England's problems.'Given how badly the middle order has functioned it would almost be an insult to Moeen Ali and Gary Ballance not to give them a game on Tuesday, most probably at the expense of Joe Root and even Eoin Morgan, both of whom are underperforming' writes Vic Marks for the Guardian'England have lost the first two ODIs as comprehensively as India lost the last two Test matches. Some of their batsmen here, despite a sound start yes, 82 without loss off 18 is not so bad even in the modern 50-over game were as inept as some of their bowlers in Cardiff.''Many experts have talked about his technique. He had an open stance in Tests and hence had no idea of the off-stump, which he corrected later, standing more side-on to get to read the line better. On Saturday, he was getting enough time on a flat wicket that afforded no sustained swing. So, when it was cut short, it was opportunity wasted.''The India batting mainstay and you are beginning to say this with gritted teeth had a Tendulkaresque reputation arriving in this country but has run into a drought of even half-centuries. On Friday night, on the eve of the third ODI here, Virat was with his longtime mate, the other struggling batsman, Shikhar Dhawan, at Marrakesh, a lively restaurant at town square. But as he walked out of the place, he still had the grumpy look that defines him.'Khurram Habib, writing for the Hindustan Times, places the microscope on Virat Kohli.'Rahane has looked India's most at-ease batsman, a sort of fail-safe, during the Test series where they went into free fall. He is technically gifted, which makes the job of opening easier. Also, he has done it before. And he enforces himself on the opposition and the game (like Shikhar Dhawan at his best), without having to make any effort (unlike Rohit). Promoting Rahane to replace Rohit solves one problem. But it creates another. It left a Rahane-sized hole in the middle order. In stepped Ambati Rayudu.'Panwar says, 'Before the third ODI, Ambati Rayudu went up to Dhoni and said he was ready to open the innings if needed. Dhoni appreciated the gesture but turned the offer down. He turned to Rahane. Apart from being a middle-order batsman, he (Rahane) is someone who will have to open if the team needs him to open. And that is one of the reasons that he is there, Dhoni explained.'Daksh Panwar's piece for the Indian Express wears the headline: 'Man down, no problem: Ambati Rayudu, Ajinkya Rahane step it up'As is the norm, let us have a gander at what the newspapers have in store for us before the action begins.However, one thing's certain. It will require a titanic effort from them to script a comeback in this series.Cook finds his neck on the chopping block again. He and Hales gave England a reasonably solid platform in the previous ODI but the middle-order crumbled under circumstances, where they usually thrive. The English bowlers, including Jimmy, lacked penetration. Maybe, England need some changes in personnel to bring about a change in the result. Their struggle against spin was as evident as broad daylight. Will Test heroes, Moeen Ali and Gary Ballance get a look in and boost the hosts? As of now, we have no answers.Greetings and welcome to the penultimate ODI between India and England. The visitors resemble a well oiled machine in blue with all the departments in good shape. Rohit's injury briefly threw them out of gear but Rahane repaired the damages. However, he will have to learn to convert starts into big scores. Rayudu scored a busy fifty, staking a claim for a long tenancy in the Indian middle order. The prowess of Dhoni and Raina in ODIs needs no introduction. Meanwhile, Kohli has just two chances to leave his mark in Old Blighty.Producing another clinical all-round performance, India sauntered to an unassailable 2-0 lead. Dhoni's merry men now stand on the cusp of their first bilateral ODI series win on English soil in 24 years. The last time, India played at Edgbaston, they edged England and rain to seal the Champions Trophy title. Can they sustain the intensity and make history again? Or will England summon the bulldog spirit to keep the series alive?Preview by PradeepOver the years, Edgbaston has turned out to be a happy hunting ground for the Indians against England, at least in the shorter format of the game. They knocked out the hosts in the 1999 World Cup with a scintillating display. 14 years later, India came out trumps once again to deny England its first ever 50-over ICC silverware, beating them in the title clash of the Champions Trophy. They will head into Tuesday's game knowing a victory will seal the ODI series, a small consolation after the humiliation in Tests.IndiaAfter the horror of the Tests, India and MS Dhoni are in a good space in a format that they have mastered pretty well. On surfaces that have aided his bowlers (spinners in particular), Dhoni has marshalled his resources expertly. The batsmen have found form while the bowlers have kept the English batsmen on a tight leash. Shikhar Dhawan has been the lone disappointment though, he once again failed to cash in on a decent start. Ajinkya Rahane,batting at the top in the absence of Rohit Sharma showed enough potential for a regular slot at the top of the order while Virat Kohli finally came good. The dashing batsman, always in the news for all the wrong reasons during the tour looked polished during his knock of 40 at Trent Bridge. Ambati Rayudu was another plus, his composed innings a major tick for a team which hasn't still settled on a regular No. 4.Things aren't that rosy in the pace department though. Mohit Sharma sustained an injury and although he came back onto the field, and effected a superb direct hit to dismiss Ian Bell, wasn't given any more overs. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was expensive at the death while Mohammad Shami wasn't at his best. With the World Cup around the corner, India needs their pacers to be at their best to be competitive something that wouldn't have escaped Dhoni's thought process.EnglandQuestions were asked about Alastair Cook's captaincy credentials after the Lord's Test and the daggers are back once again. While Cook managed to salvage the situation in Tests, the road in the ODIs looks bumpy. England's failure to get off to reasonably quick starts, a must in the new age of batting has been one of the reasons for the team to find themselves 0-2 down. If the slow starts have been an issue, the complete lack of nous against spin has proved to be detrimental from England's perspective. Unlike in the Tests, England's middle order has been a pale shadow of itself against spin. It isn't just Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja causing problems, even the part-time options of Suresh Raina and Ambati Rayudu have yielded rich dividends for Dhoni and his troops.With the batting floundering, the bowlers have found it hard to sustain pressure on the Indians. Without Broad at the other end, James Anderson has neither been unable to stem the flow of runs nor has picked up wickets in clusters. The support cast has been a huge let-down even though Chris Woakes did manage to grab 4 wickets in the second ODI at Cardiff. Unlike India, Cook hasn't been able to fall back on spinners for respite. James Tredwell has been impressive and it is a surprise that Cook hasn't thought of playing Moeen Ali who was a huge success in the Tests.Team NewsWith a settled combination, India will not be tempted at making changes to a winning unit. Mohit Sharma's injury restricted him to just three overs at Trent Bridge. He did come out to field and even effected a direct hit to dismiss Ian Bell. If he isn't fit enough to bowl, Umesh Yadav might get a game.England have everything to play for. Ben Stokes has been ineffective and that might pave the way for Moeen Ali to play his first ODI since the West Indies series in March, 2014.Weather and pitch conditionsUnlike the Champions Trophy final, a sunny day is expected on Tuesday. The pitch has slowed down in recent times and that will mean spinners will come into play.QuotesTo be honest, I too am wondering why this is happening with me and that too, so often. I think I need to make a conscious effort to bat very tight once I reach that stage of my innings: Ajinkya Rahane wants to convert his starts into bigger knocks.We know how important big runs are at the top of the order. Someone in the top four or five needs to go and do that: Alastair Cook wants his batsmen to contribute more.Teams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Dhawal Kulkarni, Sanju Samson, Umesh Yadav, Stuart Binny, Karn Sharma, Murali VijayEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Alex Hales, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, James Tredwell, Steven Finn, James Anderson, Harry Gurney, Chris Jordan, Moeen Ali, Gary BallanceLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
