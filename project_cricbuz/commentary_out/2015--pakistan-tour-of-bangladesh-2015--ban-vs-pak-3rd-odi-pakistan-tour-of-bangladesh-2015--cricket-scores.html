BANGLADESH:39.3 39.3Junaid Khan to Rahim, FOUR, Pakistan have been Banglawashed! All over! Down leg, Rahim had to get bat on it and just did that, glancing it down to fine leg, beating short fine inside the ring. Rahim lets out a mighty roar after hitting the winning runs. He has his hands aloft in joy and hugs Soumya SarkarNow round the wicket
BANGLADESH:39.2 Junaid Khan to Rahim, 2 runs, he tried but couldn't. Steps out and it is short, Rahim upper cuts wide of third man. Only a two as the fielder gets across and stopsCan Rahim finish it off on a high?
BANGLADESH:39.2 Junaid Khan to Rahim, no ball, FOUR, did Rahim hear the no-ball call? It doesn't matter now as Rahim charges Junaid Khan and smashes it straight back over the bowler's head. Connected well and now it will be a free-hit

BANGLADESH:37.4 Umar Gul to Soumya Sarkar, SIX, Soumya Sarkar is in overdrive now. He comes down the track and sends the length ball from Umar Gul soaring into the stands at deep mid-wicket. Soumya Sarkar gave it plenty and it carried way back. Umar Gul just stood there and grimaced. This is exceptional batting from the young Sarkar. He is toying with one of the best death bowlers in the world
BANGLADESH:37.3 Umar Gul to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, now one bounce over the ropes and a four to deep mid-wicket. Slower short ball outside off, Soumya Sarkar was waiting on the back foot and hammered the pull beating two fielders on the leg-side boundary
BANGLADESH:37.2 Umar Gul to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, that has been rifled past the left-hand of Umar Gul. Full on the stumps, Soumya Sarkar shows the full face of the bat and drills it in the air over the bowler. That went away very quickly to the fence
BANGLADESH:37.1 Umar Gul to Rahim, 1 run, good length outside off, Rahim opens the face of the bat and steers to third man
BANGLADESH:36.6 Babar to Soumya Sarkar, no run, very optimistic from Babar, Soumya Sarkar is beaten on the sweep, the line is middle and leg and it hits the batsman high on the pad. The umpire rightly rules it not out
BANGLADESH:36.5 Babar to Soumya Sarkar, SIX, all the fielders are in on the off-side, Soumya Sarkar goes over mid-off. Uses his feet and then whips the loft over the infield. Just about carries all the way. Soumya Sarkar and Rahim punch gloves. Soumya Sarkar has a big smile on his face

BANGLADESH:35.5 Umar Gul to Soumya Sarkar, no run, was that dropped? Need a replay. Soumya Sarkar missed a hook to a very short delivery and Rizwan fumbled after leaping. Cannot glove that and the umpire signals one short ball for the over
BANGLADESH:35.4 Umar Gul to Soumya Sarkar, no run, pitched up on off, Soumya Sarkar drills that hard towards Rahim and looks like it has deflected off Rahim's bat, that spoils all timing and rolls to mid-off. Soumya Sarkar hit that really well

Takes the helmet off and has a word with RahimSlip added now

BANGLADESH:9.5 Umar Gul to Tamim, FOUR, Tamim controlled that really well. Off-speed delivery from Umar Gul, on the stumps, Tamim half-pulled it to the right of short fine and got it wide of the fielder, once it beat the fielder, it was a boundary

BANGLADESH:7.2 Umar Gul to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, a direct hit from Azhar Ali at mid-off and Soumya Sarkar would've been walking back. But he misses despite having all three stumps to aim at. Driven without any timing to the left of mid-off and Soumya Sarkar set off. Didn't dive and was lucky that the throw missed

Hafeez will open the attackSlip, leg slip and silly-point in placeWelcome back. The Pakistani team is in a huddle. Hafeez has the new ball in his hand. His action was cleared yesterday and straightaway he's into action.Don't go too far. Do stay tuned for we will be back in a jiffyThe openers put on 91 and gave a solid platform. It was built on by Azhar Ali and Haris Sohail and the captain promptly got his maiden ODI ton. At that stage it looked like Pakistan will get 300 minimum. But the fall of Azhar Ali's wicket changed the complexion. Good captaincy by Mashrafe though for he kept attacking and backed his bowlers with aggressive fields. All the bowlers chipped in. We saw Tamim come out all guns blazing in the last ODI. Will we see the same today? Find out pretty soon when Bangladesh walk out to chase.So Pakistan have collapsed to 250 all out. They were 202/2 and going strong when Azhar Ali reached his hundred. But his wicket has sparked a meltdown of the innings. The last eight wickets going for 47 runs in 10.3 overs. Inexplicable really. Now Pakistan have a task on their hand to avert the 'Banglawash' as Athar Ali Khan puts it. The bowling wasn't out of the ordinary nor was the pitch playing tricks. Poor shots and lack of common sense from the middle-order has seen Pakistan waste all the good work done in the first 38 overs.4

We are not looking forward to 3-0 but hope to play well like the last two games, the result will come. No changes."Azhar Ali: "We are going to bat first. It looks quite slow and it might not come onto the bat. We will look to get runs on the board. We have to improve big time in every aspect of the game. Everyone know that and we will look to correct that today. Sarfraz is resting and we have three changes. Sami Aslam is making his debut. It is a big challenge for me and the whole team is behind me and supporting me."Pitch report: A different pitch today. But quite similar to the one that were used for the first two ODIs. A bit of cracks but still a good batting pitch.Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Arafat Sunny, Taskin Ahmed, Rubel HossainPakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Mohammad Hafeez, Haris Sohail, Fawad Alam, Mohammad Rizwan(w), Saad Nasim, Sami Aslam, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Junaid Khan, Zulfiqar BabarPakistan have made three changes to the team that lost the last game. Out go Rahat Ali, Sarfraz Ahmed and Saeed Ajmal. In come Umar Gul, Zulfiqar Babar and there is a debut for Sami Aslam. Bangladesh are unchanged.Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batToss and teams coming up in a short while. Do stay tuned...The form of Tamim Iqbal for Bangladesh has been a huge plus. He has notched up consecutive hundreds in the series and will be trying to become the first Bangladeshi to make three in a row today. He clinically dismantled the Pakistani attack in the last game, taking on the opening bowlers with calculated hitting. His onslaught set the platform for an easy win. For Pakistan Umar Gul has been drafted in as a replacement for Ehsan Adil. He should get a look in today and it will be interesting to see how he goes.Pakistan are undergoing a transition phase after the World Cup. For this series they are without Misbah and Afridi - who have retired from ODIs. They have a new captain in Azhar Ali who is yet to find his bearings. So the losses in the first two games isn't a huge shock considering how Bangladesh have been playing ever since the World Cup. The injuries to players like Sohaib Maqsood, Sohail Khan, Yasir Shah and Ehsan Adil hasn't helped the side too.Shakib said before the series began that they will be favorites. A lot of them laughed at that statement. After two matches and with the series sealed in favor of his side, it is Shakib who is doing all the laughing. Pakistan have been outplayed in both games as the hosts won their first ever ODI series. A warm welcome to the final game of this series as Bangladesh attempt a rare shot at a whitewash.Teams:Pakistan (From): Azhar Ali(c), Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Mohammad Hafeez, Haris Sohail, Fawad Alam, Mohammad Rizwan, Saad Nasim, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Rahat Ali, Sami Aslam, Asad Shafiq, Zulfiqar BabarBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, Abul Hasan, Rony TalukdarLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
