SRI LANKA:42.4 42.4Willey to Pradeep, out Caught by Woakes!! Done deal! England have whiplashed the Lankan Tigers and seal the series 3-0. Has been a spectacular show from the English boys and they walk off with their heads held high as the crowd stand to acclaim the triumph. FINAL WICKET: Pradeep clears his front leg and clatters a full ball sprayed at his toes, only succeeds in getting a thick leading edge. Woakes, at mid-on, could have sipped a coffee and taken that. He has bucket hands and had enough time, ain't dropping that. Pradeep c Woakes b Willey 7(8) [4s-1]Willey to Pradeep, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:42.3 Willey to Chaminda Bandara, 1 run, first runs in international cricket for Chaminda Bandara. Tries to fetch a length ball outside off and gets a thick outside edge which dribbles down to third man

SRI LANKA:42.1 Willey to Chaminda Bandara, no run, full and hint of reverse swing around off-stump, driven with soft hands towards mid-off
SRI LANKA:41.6 Woakes to Pradeep, no run, slower short ball and Pradeep is taken aback by the slowness of the delivery, rises on his toes to fend. The ball didn't rise much, hits him around the ribcage. Oopsy! That hurts...
SRI LANKA:41.5 Woakes to Pradeep, no run, classic, textbook defence in front of mid-on
SRI LANKA:41.4 Woakes to Pradeep, 2 runs, in the air and past a diving backward point. Pradeep slices the cut but Jason Roy, perhaps, was a little too late to put in the dive. Runs, nonetheless
SRI LANKA:41.3 Woakes to Pradeep, no run, shuffles far too across and wellies his willow, absolutely village that, Woakes angled it in but way too much for Pradeep's liking - Missing the leg peg by some distance
SRI LANKA:41.2 Woakes to Pradeep, no run, bumper tailed in late and took Pradeep by surprise, he whooshes wildly and is nowhere near the line
SRI LANKA:41.1 Woakes to Pradeep, FOUR, full toss and Nuwan Pradeep is trying his best to improve his ODI average here, steps to leg and whacks it off the meat through extra coverChaminda Bandara, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:40.6 Willey to Chandimal, out Bowled!! The reverse swing - Yep! It's still alive in ODI cricket. Even MJ seems to be baffled after watching the replays. Nothing much Dinesh Chandimal could do about this delivery: Gives himself room and tries to open up the off-side with a fiercing willow, Willey pitched it on a perfect length and generated some reverse swing which tailed away late - To miss Chandimal's swing and clllllling the timbers. Chandimal b Willey 53(66) [4s-2 6s-1]Willey to Chandimal, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
SRI LANKA:40.5 Willey to Pradeep, 1 run, full and following the batsman, flipped off the toes through mid-wicket, and Nuwan Pradeep is off the markNuwan Pradeep, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:40.4 Willey to Lakmal, out Caught by Eoin Morgan!! Lakmal walks off after playing a typical Test match knock. Excuse the pun! He's played according to the situation but I'm sure the management must have expected something better. Slower full ball enticing a drive outside off, Lakmal chases - All brawn, no timing and he picks out the English skip. at short cover. FYI: This is Suranga Lakmal's highest ODI score. Lakmal c Eoin Morgan b Willey 10(23) [4s-1]Willey to Lakmal, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:40.3 Willey to Chandimal, 1 run, crashed to deep cover for yet another easy single
SRI LANKA:40.2 Willey to Lakmal, 1 run, a direct hit and Lakmal would have been walking back! Tickles it to short fine and runs... The fielder gets across, aims at the bowler's end and misses
SRI LANKA:40.1 Willey to Chandimal, 1 run, swiped in the gap through mid-wicket, Chandimal keeps churning out runs
SRI LANKA:39.6 Woakes to Lakmal, no run, and he continues to do that groping dance, outside off - He fences and misses, lost the count fellas...Hold on Ladies and gentlemen! Mr. Suranga Lakmal has some problems with his willow. Ironic cheers from the crowd, and guess what! The sub trundles in with a couple of water bottles. Oh! The crowd are absolutely into it, trying their best to mock Lakmal. "Someone lend him a bat" whispers Nick Knight in the comm. box. And here's the drama - The other sub flies in with a willow which perhaps belongs to one among the top 3 batsmen. Good grief! Go, figure...
SRI LANKA:39.5 Woakes to Lakmal, no run, Chris Woakes keeps peckering that outside off zone, Lakmal with his feet cemented flays and sees the ball fly past his blade

SRI LANKA:39.4 Woakes to Lakmal, no run, worked into the leg-side
SRI LANKA:39.3 Woakes to Lakmal, no run, inside edge and that might have been the only reason. A huge appeal for leg before as Lakmal looks to flick, edged into the pads
SRI LANKA:39.2 Woakes to Chandimal, 1 run, jumps and forces a short of length towards the off-side to sneak in a quick single
SRI LANKA:39.1 Woakes to Chandimal, no run, now Chandimal attempts a ugly swoosh outside off, played it a little too early. Missed!
SRI LANKA:38.6 Willey to Lakmal, FOUR, full and Lakmal spanked the straight drive, just that he released too much of power into that stroke, scorched off past mid-off
SRI LANKA:38.5 Willey to Lakmal, no run, a swing and a miss outside off
SRI LANKA:38.4 Willey to Chandimal, 1 run, 4th successive fifty for Lokuge Dinesh Chandimal. Take a bow son! Without any doubts, one can affirm how valuable a player he is for his country. Full and wide, he slices the drive over backward point and reaches the landmark. Muted celebrations...
SRI LANKA:38.3 Willey to Lakmal, 1 run, an action replay of the first delivery, just that the long-on fielder pounced in quickly and denied any chance of sneaking a second run

SRI LANKA:37.5 Woakes to Lakmal, no run, somehow manages to get behind the line of this delivery and meekly pushes towards cover
SRI LANKA:37.4 Woakes to Lakmal, no run, and again! No intent this time though, feels for a delivery that should have been probably left alone and then practices a few shadow strokes once the ball ripped past his outside edge
SRI LANKA:37.3 Woakes to Lakmal, no run, clears his front leg and looks to send the leather to somewhere in London, could only draw thin air. Moving across, clearing front leg and et al.
SRI LANKA:37.2 Woakes to Chandimal, 1 run, Chandimal is throwing the kitchen sink, the approach I meant. Fair enough! Pitched up outside off, driven with firm hands past a diving short cover
SRI LANKA:37.1 Woakes to Chandimal, 2 runs, back of a length jagged back in ever so slightly around off, Chandimal tucks off his hips and collects a couple of runs
SRI LANKA:36.6 Willey to Lakmal, no run, sprayed at the stumps, Lakmal clips and sees short fine swooping in
SRI LANKA:36.5 Willey to Lakmal, no run, goes wide of the crease to create that seed of doubt in the batsman's mind. Angles it well in and nearly knocks Lakmal over, but Lakmal had good presence of mind to dig it out
SRI LANKA:36.4 Willey to Lakmal, no run, slower one on and around off peg, Lakmal stays firm and dinks it down the pitchFrom round the wicket now

SRI LANKA:35.3 Woakes to Lakmal, no run, awkwardly fended into the off-side
SRI LANKA:35.2 Woakes to Chandimal, 1 run, had Willey at mid-off gathered the ball cleanly, Chandimal would have been in trouble. He squirts this drive off the toe-end and sets off for an ill-advised single, a fumble and he survives. May be he is confident about Lakmal's batting skills too..
SRI LANKA:35.1 Woakes to Chandimal, no run, pounds it on a full length aiming around that fourth stump channel, a jammed drive straight into the hands of short coverChris Woakes [5.0-0-22-0] is back into the attackWoakesey is back to wrap it up...
SRI LANKA:34.6 Plunkett to Chandimal, leg byes, 1 run, straying onto the pads, Chandimal misses the flick and the ball goes off the pad to fine leg. Chandimal will keep strike
SRI LANKA:34.5 Plunkett to Lakmal, 1 run, nasty first delivery to get. Sharp bouncer aimed at the batsman's head, Lakmal had clue about that. He closed his eyes and looked to fend it away, is pinged on the glove and the ball pops to backward square. A leg gully would have gobbled that upSuranga Lakmal, right handed bat, comes to the creaseThat wickets also brings the drinks break. England are almost there. Only a Chandimal special can save Sri Lanka. But he does not have the support at the other end. So, Prasanna's wicket might have been nail in the coffin
SRI LANKA:34.4 Plunkett to S Prasanna, out Caught by Willey!! A magnificent catch by Willey. The short ball is undoing of Prasanna once again in the series. England recognised that weakness right after the first game and since then Prasanna has faced lot of short stuff. Being an adventurous man, he takes it on and pulls it to fine leg. Willey might have lost it in the shadows, but does well to run forward and take it with his left hand. All this while diving forward. S Prasanna c Willey b Plunkett 5(17)Plunkett to S Prasanna, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

SRI LANKA:34.1 Plunkett to Chandimal, SIX, unlucky! Not where Chandimal intended but he will take that. Short and on off, Chandimal shimmies down and decides to take on the pull, the top-edge flies over third man for a maximum. The pace of Plunkett was the undoing there
SRI LANKA:33.6 Adil Rashid to S Prasanna, no run, flighted around off, Prasanna gets a good stride forward and keeps it out. Rashid finishes his spell and he seems like a disappointed man. Feels he could have had another wicket or two. His figures read: 10-0-41-2
SRI LANKA:33.5 Adil Rashid to S Prasanna, no run, slider on middle and leg, Prasanna ekes out an inside edge onto the pad, luckily the ball drops in the vacant silly point region

SRI LANKA:30.5 Jordan to Chandimal, no run, appeal for LBW and umpire Gough isn't interested. Jordan looked very confident and HawkEye shows it to be clipping leg-stump. Chandimal falls over while attempting the flick, is rapped on the pads in front of middle, but the angle might have saved Chandimal there
SRI LANKA:30.4 Jordan to S Prasanna, leg byes, 1 run, Prasanna has no room to work with, can't lay bat on the flick, but collects a leg-bye
SRI LANKA:30.3 Jordan to S Prasanna, no run, still something in the surface, if you hit the right areas. Good length ball outside off, jagging away from the batsman, Prasanna goes fishing at that and is beaten all ends up. Still keeps curling on the way to Buttler

SRI LANKA:27.6 Adil Rashid to Dasun Shanaka, out Stumped!! Rashid has his man! Shanaka was always looking to take on the leggie. The bowler was clever, he pushed it well outside off, Shanaka came down the track, was nowhere close to the ball and didn't have a second line of defence. Easy stumping for Buttler. Shanaka tried to get in, but Buttler was too quick for him. Dasun Shanaka st Buttler b Adil Rashid 22(29) [4s-1 6s-1]Adil Rashid to Dasun Shanaka, THAT'S OUT!! Stumped!!

They keep getting closer to 3-0 with every wicket. It was the normal leg-break, which didn't turn in, went on with the angle, Tharanga drives away from the body, leaving a big gap for the ball to go through. The off-stump is disturbed and Sri Lanka have lost half their side. Tharanga b Adil Rashid 0(1)Adil Rashid to Tharanga, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!

SRI LANKA:20.6 Plunkett to Mathews, out Bowled!! Whatta reply! He enjoyed that and even did the double-fist pump. After being hit back over you, that is the best response anyone can come up with. Fast, swinging in and right in the blockhole, Mathews fails to keep it out, was a tad late in bringing his bat down and the ball sneaked through to hit the base of middle stump. Sri Lanka needed their captain to build a partnership with Chandimal, but not to be as they slip further. Mathews b Plunkett 13(15) [4s-2]Plunkett to Mathews, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
SRI LANKA:20.5 Plunkett to Mathews, FOUR, Mathews would have been in jail. He almost murdered Plunkett.

SRI LANKA:16.3 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, out Lbw!! Comes round the wicket to Gunathilaka and raps him on the front pad as he was walking away across the stumps looking to flick it onto the on-side. Loud appeal from Plunkett and the umpire certainly thinks so. Gunathilaka is walking upto his partner to check whether to review it, but hey, there are none left after it was wasted on a pretty straightforward decision earlier. So Gunathilaka has to depart. Looked like one of those 'umpire's call' decisions again. Gunathilaka lbw b Plunkett 48(45) [4s-6]Plunkett to Gunathilaka, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!

K Perera is on strike. Woakes will open the attackSri Lankan openers are out in the middle, Woakes has the new cherry in hand with two slips in placeAll the three Lankan seamers had a forgettable outing failing to apply any pressure and spraying the ball all around. Chaminda Bandara in particular had a forgettable debut conceding 83 runs in his quota. Would the English bowlers manage the discipline they ensured while bowling first, or would the Lankan batsmen be able to chase this down on what has so far been a win-less tour? Join us in 30 minutes.What started as a start-stop contest, soon gained momentum as the rain-embedded clouds decided to stay away, giving way to what started off as a pretty even contest only to blow out of proportion towards the death. For the first time in this series, the English batsmen seemed susceptible to the Lankan part-time spinners, who managed to keep a cap on the scoring rate and chipped away with key wickets regularly. However, the arrival of Buttler at the crease meant some innovative batting, throwing all the bowling plans and fielding positions out of the window. With the ever-so-dependable Joe Root at the other end anchoring the innings, they put on a busy 109-run partnership in quick time. 4

ENGLAND:40.4 S Prasanna to Root, no run, flighted delivery on the stumps, Root tries to defend, the ball doesn't turn much and beats Root on the inside half of the bat, hits the front foot, the replay suggests that even the impact wasn't in line with the stumps. Such a poor review. The captain had to rely on the keeper and Chandimal was terrible with his judgement. I am saying this because it is an absolute waste of timeAppeal for LBW, not given. Are they taking the review? Yes, they have! Absolute waste of time according to me. This is where the keeper (Chandimal here) has to give correct inputs. That was easily missing leg stump to the naked eye. This was a review more in desperartion. Hawk-Eye says missing the stumps

ENGLAND:35.5 Chaminda Bandara to Buttler, 1 run, a back foot punch to long-off
ENGLAND:35.4 Chaminda Bandara to Buttler, no run, oh the inside edge is found, but it hits Buttler's pads. Full and inviting the drive, Buttler probably didn't expect that length as his feet weren't there fully forward, played away from the body and got away with it
ENGLAND:35.3 Chaminda Bandara to Buttler, 2 runs, that's nicely done! Buttler walks towards the bowler trying to unsettle Bandara's line, the bowler does decently well to keep it back of a length and close to the off stump, but the batsman plays a lovely backward punch wide of mid-off
ENGLAND:35.2 Chaminda Bandara to Buttler, 2 runs, Buttler moves across and flicks this full ball on the leg stump through backward square leg, enough time for two runs
ENGLAND:35.1 Chaminda Bandara to Buttler, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, Buttler respects the bowler with a defence to coverDrinks are on the field now. 15 overs to go, can England get to 320? Woakes is still to come. Depends a lot on these two though. We all know how dangerous Jos Buttler is once he gets set. And do I need to say about run-machine Joe Root? "Once again weren't penetrative enough to get wickets," is what Mathews said after the last game. Can his bowlers do well at the death? We'll wait and watch...
ENGLAND:34.6 Gunathilaka to Buttler, 1 run, short enough for Buttler to go back and work to deep square leg, Root thought about two, but his partner said no
ENGLAND:34.5 Gunathilaka to Root, 1 run, straight at the stumps, but big gaps on the on-side mean Root is keen to work this softly into the vacant zones, mid-wicket this time

ENGLAND:34.3 Gunathilaka to Buttler, 1 run, nudged away to mid-wicket
ENGLAND:34.2 Gunathilaka to Buttler, 2 runs, oh dear! Poor cricket, both from the bowler and the fielder.

ENGLAND:34.1 Gunathilaka to Root, 1 run, Root goes back in his crease and nudges easily through mid-wicket
ENGLAND:33.6 Chaminda Bandara to Buttler, no run, a loud call of "no" from Buttler, after lunging forward and defending this length ball to the right of short cover
ENGLAND:33.5 Chaminda Bandara to Buttler, no run, Buttler moves across and taps it into the off-side
ENGLAND:33.4 Chaminda Bandara to Buttler, FOUR, is that leg-byes? No, given as runs. Good call from the ump, the ball took the inside edge and then ran away off the thigh pad. Bandara pays the price for bowling a leg stump line, the length was short enough to allow Buttler to go back and attempt the glance
ENGLAND:33.3 Chaminda Bandara to Root, 1 run, almost a replay of the previous delivery, just that Root hit the gap, to the left of the man at cover this time
ENGLAND:33.2 Chaminda Bandara to Root, no run, full extension of the arms and the feet are nicely forward as Root drives straight to the man at cover

ENGLAND:32.5 Gunathilaka to Bairstow, out Caught by Dasun Shanaka!! Now then, now then, would you believe it! This man has the knack of picking key wickets and he has three now. Even in the last game, he got Joe Root to end a massive stand with Jason Roy. Bairstow will be livid with himself when he sees this on the screen/replay. Can't really blame him because he didn't intend to hit to long-on. As the ball came full at him, he went for the lofted drive more towards long-off, the ball got the inside half of the bat and had enough legs to carry all the way to the fielder in the deep. Bairstow c Dasun Shanaka b Gunathilaka 22(28) [4s-1]Gunathilaka to Bairstow, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
ENGLAND:32.4 Gunathilaka to Bairstow, no run, nudged into the on-side

ENGLAND:31.4 Chaminda Bandara to Root, 1 run, that's a friendly full toss, Bandara went for the yorker, but got it wrong, lucky that Root didn't go hard and only drove it to the left of cover, who made a diving half-stop
ENGLAND:31.3 Chaminda Bandara to Root, no run, Root tries to step out and put the bowler under pressure, but only succeeds in yorking himself up, tried to squeeze it out, makes no contact
ENGLAND:31.2 Chaminda Bandara to Bairstow, 1 run, width on offer outside off stump, easily driven to deep cover, oh the fielder tries to attack the ball and in the process fumbles, Bairstow was keen for two, but Root wasn't
ENGLAND:31.1 Chaminda Bandara to Root, 1 run, starts the new spell with a good approach to the crease, I mean the run-up is full of intensity, and bowls a fullish ball close to the off stump, Root softly drives it towards mid-offChaminda Bandara [4.0-0-35-0] is back into the attack
ENGLAND:30.6 Gunathilaka to Root, 1 run, Root goes on the back foot and pulls it to deep mid-wicket

Here we go..10:31 Local Time, 09:31 GMT, 15:01 IST: Thanks to the passing drizzle, we are in for a 10-minute delayed start. The match would start at 10.40 local t
ENGLAND:10.40 local time .There was a bit of rain around and hence the covers were on just after the toss. However, it seems to have passed and we might start on time. Will update a confirmation as and when we know them...Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Seekkuge Prasanna, Dasun Shanaka, Upul Tharanga, Chaminda Bandara, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga LakmalEngland (Playing XI): Jason Roy, James Vince, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Adil RashidSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldSri Lanka, on the other hand, don't have plenty of options. Most of their reserves are injured or inexperienced. The only change that might happen is Seekkuge Prasanna making way for Dhananjaya De Silva. All the speculations will be put to rest in a few minutes as we are close to toss time. Stay tuned!Since England have won the series, will they tinker with the line-up? Or will Morgan and Co. go for the kill? One change which will be forced upon them is the injury to Alex Hales. The opener injured himself while fielding in the previous game and was absent for most part, he didn't even bat. Which means James Vince might get to play his second ODI or Moeen Ali might open and Morgan may go in with an extra bowler in Chris Jordan.The series has already been decided. England after claiming the Test series 2-0, have taken an unassailable lead in the ODIs as well. So, today's encounter is a mere formality to complete the five-match ODI series or as Sri Lanka would see it; a chance to regain some of the lost pride. The scoreline would read differently had the visitors been more professional in the first game, which England managed to tie and for Jason Roy's masterpiece at The Oval, where he almost single-handedly took England home.Preview:After the 2-0 Test series loss, Sri Lanka were buoyed by their revamped One-Day International (ODI) side as they walloped Ireland with ease. Against England, however, it has been a different story.Two of the four completed ODIs in the five-match series have left the thought of 'so close, yet so far' for the visitors. Starting off with a tie, where they failed to defend 286, they were handed a ten-wicket thrashing in the second ODI. The third was a washout and just when it looked like Sri Lanka's batsmen had finally stepped up and delivered with four half-centuries from their top five, Jason Roy played spoilsport with a record 162 - helping England take the series in the fourth game.With the series lost, Sri Lanka have one last chance to end on a high in the fifth and final ODI on Saturday (July 2) in Cardiff, before heading into the only Twenty20 International between the sides.Sri Lanka have made the most of their limited resources, but have fallen short in the bowling aspect of things. In the absence of Dhammika Prasad and Dushmantha Chameera due to injuries, and the subsequent loss of Shaminda Eranga to suspect action, they have had to depend on their young unit to deliver. That, against a side like England that have taken their aggressive approach way too seriously since their disappointment at the World Cup 2015.England's batsmen have since, scored the most number of half-centuries and centuries with their aggressive nature boding well for them as they have won three out of their last five series. The ones that they conceded to Australia and South Africa were both closely fought, as evident in their 3-2 win margins.With an unassailable 2-0 lead, they would want to extend their unbeaten run and carry with them the momentum into the lone T20I and deprive Sri Lanka of a win all tour. As the points table stands, England have 16 points with four wins in seven matches across formats, while Sri Lanka have four - owing to the drawn Test and the abandoned game.When: England vs Sri Lanka, 5th ODI, July 2, 2016 at 10:30 AM Local Time, 3:00 PM ISTWhere: Sophia Gardens, CardiffWhat to expect: Rain has followed the two teams so far in the ODI leg of the tour, and the forecast for game day isn't the most promising with a couple of showers expected on an otherwise breezy day with a high of 17.Team News:England: Alex Hales suffered a back spasm while fielding in the fourth ODI, due to which, Moeen Ali was asked to open. Hales's services weren't required in that ODI thanks to Roy, but with the series already in the bag, it is a great chance that he might make way for 25-year-old James Vince, who has only one ODI to his name.Sri Lanka: Seekkuge Prasanna continued to struggle with the ball and might make way for the all-round option of Dhananjaya de Silva.Who said what:If we're going to be realistic challengers at the World Cup in 2019 I reckon we've got to be in the top two or three in the world, which means we've got to be far more consistent than we have been: Paul Farbrace, assistant coach of England, has bigger targets for the team.Did you know?- Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal have had four fifty-plus partnerships in as many ODIs this series. Only Alex Hales and Joe Root (five vs South Africa in 2016) have put together more fifty-plus partnerships in a bilateral series.- Sri Lanka have played two ODIs in Cardiff and lost both. England have played eight ODIs at the venue, winning four and losing one while three ended in no results.- Numbers three, four and five have scored fifties for Sri Lanka in the last two ODIs - first time it has happened twice in the same series for Sri Lanka.Teams:England (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, Steven Finn, James VinceSri Lanka (From): Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Seekkuge Prasanna, Dasun Shanaka, Upul Tharanga, Farveez Maharoof, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Dhananjaya de Silva, Suraj RandivLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
