Shapoor will open the attackWelcome back...Afghanistan batsmen have done well to put up a competitive total after being sent in by Taylor. Ghani was the pivot around which the others batted. He got to his maiden ODI ton and looked comfortable in the middle. Zimbabwe didn't look like the team that played the first game. There were far too many loose deliveries on offer. It is now upto their batsmen to chase down this target. Can Afghanistan pull off a victory? Will Zimbabwe stroll through the target? We will find out in a short while....4
