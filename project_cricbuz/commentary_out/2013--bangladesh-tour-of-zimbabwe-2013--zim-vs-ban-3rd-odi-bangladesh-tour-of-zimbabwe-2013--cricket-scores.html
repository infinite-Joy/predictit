Toss and teams in 10 mins. Stay tuned...PreviewZimbabwe and Bangladesh go into Wednesday's third and final one-day international in Bulawayo locked at one match apiece, yet it is the hosts who know they will need to improve their game if they are to claim a rare series victory. After being humiliated by 121 runs in the first match last week, Zimbabwe drew level with a six-wicket victory on Sunday, preventing Bangladesh from extending their unbeaten run in bilateral one-day series to three. However Zimbabwe have enjoyed the benefit of bowling first in both matches so far, with early morning starts giving their seam bowlers an advantage against Bangladesh's strong top order - none of whom have registered telling scores as a result. Tamim Iqbal, Mohammad Ashraful, Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan remain some of the most dangerous batsmen on either side, yet none have passed 34 in the series thus far. "They are always a side that is very threatening," Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor said. "Some of their big players have not fired so that's a concern for us. "However if we can bowl well like we have been bowling up front it's always going to be tough to score. Hopefully we can execute our skills better and get over the line." Having shared the two-Test series 1-1, both sides will see Wednesday's match as an opportunity to confirm a modicum of superiority ahead of two Twenty20 internationals at the weekend.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Brendan Taylor(c), Regis Chakabva(w), Tinashe Panyangara, Elton Chigumbura, Graeme Cremer, Timycen Maruma, Shingirai Masakadza, Natsai Mushangwe, Richmond Mutumbami, Vusi Sibanda, Prosper Utseya, Malcolm Waller, Tendai Chatara, Michael Chinouya, Kyle Jarvis, Hamilton Masakadza, Keegan Meth, Tinotenda Mutombodzi, Ray Price, Sikandar Raza, Brian Vitori, Sean WilliamsBangladesh (From): Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Ziaur Rahman, Abdur Razzak, Shamsur Rahman, Shafiul Islam, Jahurul Islam, Mohammad Ashraful, Nasir Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Shahadat Hossain, Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal, Mahmudullah, Mominul Haque, Robiul Islam, Sajidul Islam, Sohag GaziLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
