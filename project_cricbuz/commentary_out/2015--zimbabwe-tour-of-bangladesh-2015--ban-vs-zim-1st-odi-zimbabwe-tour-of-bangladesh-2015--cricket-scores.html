Have they learnt their lessons to surprise the hosts this time or is it going to be the same order? Stay tuned as we head to toss in a while from now.Bangladesh's rise in limited overs cricket has been phenomenal and there have been consistency in their performance. So, for Zimbabwe it will be an enriching experience to play away from home against a formidable side.This year (2015) has been a fairy tale for Bangladesh. After making the quarterfinals of the 2015 World Cup, they toppled Pakistan, India and South Africa at home. On the other hand, Zimbabwe recently lost the ODI and T20I series against Afghanistan. Hello and warm welcome to the first of the five ODIs.Preview:Bangladesh will be on guard against complacency when they face a struggling Zimbabwe in a three-match one-day series which starts in Dhaka on Saturday. The hosts have not lost a home series to Zimbabwe since 2001 and routed the minnows 5-0 last year to spark a remarkable winning streak.This year, Bangladesh reached the World Cup quarter-final Down Under and recorded back-to-back one-day series wins at home against powerful nations such as Pakistan, India and South Africa. It lifted Bangladesh to seventh in the official rankings and guaranteed them a place in the eight-nation Champions Trophy in England in 2017.Bangladesh's Sri Lankan coach Chandika Hathurusinghe declined to take another victory for granted, saying "there was no reason for complacency" in his team.Meanwhile, Zimbabwe come fresh from a humiliating loss at home to Afghanistan, who won the one-dayers 3-2 and clinched both Twenty20 internationals. "The most important thing for us is to pick ourselves up and focus on Bangladesh," Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura said.Bangladesh's one-day captain Mashrafe Mortaza remains doubtful for the first match since he is yet to regain full fitness after suffering from dengue fever. Bangladesh opener Soumya Sarkar was also ruled out of the match with a side strain and was replaced by Imrul Kayes.Zimbabwe are also due to play two Twenty20 internationals on the limited-overs tour.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Chamu Chibhabha, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Craig Ervine, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sikandar Raza, Graeme Cremer, Wellington Masakadza, Luke Jongwe, John Nyumbu, Tinashe Panyangara, Malcolm Waller, Taurai Muzarabani, Neville Madziva, Tendai Chisoro, Regis ChakabvaBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Litton Das, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Nasir Hossain, Sabbir Rahman, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Jubair Hossain, Al-Amin Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Imrul Kayes, Arafat Sunny, Kamrul Islam RabbiLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
