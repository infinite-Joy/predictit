New Zealand are only 80 runs away from securing a comfortable win. Williamson is looking in fine touch and would want to chase this down as quickly as possible.New Zealand started off brightly, but Guptill got out early after hitting a few fours. Williamson then joined McCullum at the crease, who played aggressively for a little while, but perished while trying to run it down to third man. Currently, Williamson and Taylor are at the crease and Williamson looks in superb nick. New Zealand need 80 runs from 41 overs to win this game. It should be easy, but they need to be wary of the Scottish bowlers. Take a break and join us in a short while to follow the final part of the run-chase.

Wardlaw will open the bowling for the Scots and Guptill will be on strike first up. There are 2 slips in place.Scotland made a dubious record today - 5 batsmen got out on a duck, out of which 4 were golden ducks. This is the most number of ducks for Scotland in an ODI innings.The New Zealand new ball bowlers - Southee and Boult are becoming an exciting combination. They might be the best exponents of the new cherry going around the world. Milne went past the edge on a number of times, but was unlucky not to have picked up a wicket. Anderson provided the crucial wickets and Vettori ran through the tail. Now upto the hosts' batsmen to chase this down.Machan and Berrington saw off the threatening spell with some solid batting. The pair did all the hard work and then started to play freely. They added 97 runs for the 5th wicket and got to their respective fifties. However, they fell in quick succession and left Scotland in deeper trouble. The lower-order was no match for Vettori, who outfoxed them with his variations. New Zealand will now come out to bat in 10 minutes time and will bat till the scheduled lunch time, that means they will bat for around 40 minutes.McCullum at the toss said, that the ball would do a bit for the first 30-45 minutes and it certainly did. But it needed the bowlers to land it in the right areas, Boult and Southee did just that. The latter started with a maiden and the former backed it up with two wickets in the over. Southee then picked up two more to reduce Scotland to 12/4. 3
SCOTLAND:36.2 Vettori to Iain Wardlaw, out Lbw!! Floated up on off and middle, Wardlaw goes forward for the defensive push, but the ball strikes the pad first instead of the bat.

Iain Wardlaw lbw b Vettori 0(1)Vettori to Iain Wardlaw, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!New Zealand have decided to review an LBW decision. Wardlaw is the man in question. Was it pad first? Let's see. Vettori's front foot is fine. There were two noises, but it looks to have hit the pad first. The umpire is taking his time, checking all the angles. It definitely hits the pad first.

Coetzer is on strike. Southee will open the attackOur man, Jamie Alter, is at the ground and he has this to say: 'Here come the two teams, to generous applause. Dunedin being Edinburgh's sister town here in New Zealand, the Scottish touch is evident. Makes for an enjoyable setting."The players are out in the middle.. Can Boult and Southee exploit the early morning moisture and pave the way for another win for the hosts?Pitch Report: 'It's a nice looking surface. There is some nice grass cover, that's the main thing about it. That should give some pace to the track. The seamers will get some assistance for sure, a little bit of movement early on. If you get through the first 30-45 minutes, it's going to be easy to bat on. No surprises that New Zealand are going to bowl first, they wanted to bowl first in the SL match that was played here (NZ were reduced to 92/5 before being lifted to 360 by Grant Elliott and Luke Ronchi). Look out for Southee and Boult to make some inroads early. For Scotland, get through the first 8-10 overs and they might prosper with some runs, the outfield is in great condition, the shorter boundaries should help the batsmen as well,' reckons Simon DoullTeams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Adam Milne, Trent BoultScotland (Playing XI): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Rob Taylor, Majid Haq, Iain WardlawNew Zealand have won the toss and have opted to fieldPreston Mommsen: 'We are also looking forward to the game, very excited to be back at the World Cup. We were looking to bat first anyway, need to get runs on the board and then hopefully put them under pressure. Looks like a good wicket. We want to show off our skills and hopefully today provides us that opportunity. We are very happy with our preparations and feeling very confident. We had some good results against Ireland and took West Indies pretty close as well.'Brendon McCullum: 'We will bowl first, there will be a bit in it for the first 45 minutes, will look to exploit the early moisture on the wicket. We had a training session yesterday. Great to be at Dunedin. Looking forward to the match, we will treat it as any other World Cup match. Great opportunity to execute our skills, no changes to our team.'The Scots were here last October as part of the ICC warm-up programme where the Associates were given an opportunity to get useful match practice in these conditions. Up against a New Zealand XI that included as many as 8 players currently featuring in the World Cup, they came close to upstaging the fancied Kiwis. Chasing 263, they fell short by the smallest margin of one run. Can they pull off a stunning heist today?On the other hand, Preston Mommsen, Scotland's captain, is quietly confident of putting up a good show against the co-hosts, who are also one of the top favourites to win the prestigious tournament. "I think we have quite a dynamic side. Obviously inexperienced in terms of playing on the world stage, but at the same time, I think we can use that to our advantage. Very raw team, so there will be a huge amount of energy there, a huge amount of passion, and the boys will be playing very hard," he said.New Zealand captain, Brendon McCullum, spoke ahead of the match and said he was expecting a good fight from the inexperienced Scotland team. He also ruled out any complacency by the hosts. "We've got to make sure we're on our game and treat it as if we're playing one of the bigger teams, as well, because in this World Cup I think we've seen at the moment with West Indies under a little bit of pressure, as well, that the Associate teams certainly have players capable of standing up and making things pretty uncomfortable for you," he said.Weather Report: It's a bright and sunny day at Dunedin with the temperature expected to hover around the 20 degree mark. There's no threat of rain and the wind is expected to blow from the Northeast direction.History Book: The two teams have met each other twice and it isn't a massive surprise that New Zealand recorded thumping wins in both encounters. They haven't played each other since 2008 though and that means the current set of Scottish players would have very little in terms of scars from the last hiding.09:45 Local Time, 20:45 GMT, 02:15 IST: The World Cup carnival has moved across to the southern most city of New Zealand. We are at the University Oval in Dunedin where the hosts entertain Scotland in their second match of the World Cup. The hosts have already started on a winning note, demolishing Sri Lanka in the inaugural match of the tournament. For Preston Mommsen and his merry band of Scottish cricketers, it's an opportunity to prove themselves in front of the global audience.PreviewMoments before Preston Mommsen walked in for his final interaction with the media before Scotland's World Cup opener against New Zealand at University Oval on Tuesday, the sound of Scottish bagpipes could be heard coming from one of the adjacent playing fields on the campus of the University of Otago. It must have been part of the university band's practice routines for orientation week - the campus is starting to get active with new arrivals and their parents, as well as returning students - but the sounds of bagpipes was another reminder of where Mommsen's Scotland team are based: Dunedin, known as the Edinburgh of the South, and indeed planned in light of its Scottish predecessor.Game six of the World Cup pits Scotland against New Zealand, who hammered Sri Lanka by 98 runs in the tournament opener in Christchurch, but Mommsen will be hoping that a bit of Dunedin's Scottish heritage rubs off and motivates his Associates-level team against the in-form home team.Mommsen was born in South Africa, but today proudly leads Scotland into their third World Cup - after winless runs in 1999 and 2007 - and was confident of the way the team has entered the tournament. "I think we have quite a dynamic side," he said. "Obviously inexperienced in terms of playing on the world stage, but at the same time, I think we can use that to our advantage. Very raw team, so there will be a huge amount of energy there, a huge amount of passion, and the boys will be playing very hard."Scotland's two warm-ups in Australia resulted in a 179-run win over Ireland and a three-run defeat to West Indies when they were chasing 313, but they will also take a bit of confidence from a practice game against a New Zealand XI featuring Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi, Daniel Vettori, Mitchell McClenaghan and Kyle Mills in Lincoln, last October."We watched a video this morning of that game, and we took a huge amount from that game. We took them very close, and really we should have won that game," said Mommsen. "A lot of the guys playing tomorrow played in that game, so we've got that to call upon, and hopefully we can produce a similar performance tomorrow and take the game deep. The buildup has been near perfect for the boys. We're very realistic about the opposition that we're up against. Obviously, New Zealand are a quality team, and the form they are currently in, they're going to be a difficult team to break down. But at the same time, we've prepared as we have for every other game in the leadup to this game tomorrow, and hopefully we can put in a good performance."Brendon McCullum was part of that game a few months ago, and he too spoke of the team sitting down to watch the video of it. "Yeah, we did some scouting this morning on the bowlers. I've had plenty of footage the last little while that we can get our hands on and I've obviously tried to cover that, as well," he said. :That's one of our big things as a team, that we make sure we go in well planned and well prepared, but they gave us a good run for our money at Lincoln a few months ago. Yeah, we've got to make sure we're on our game and treat it as if we're playing one of the bigger teams, as well, because in this World Cup, I think we've seen at the moment with West Indies under a little bit of pressure, as well, that the Associate teams certainly have players capable of standing up and making things pretty uncomfortable for you."New Zealand have been a dominant team over the last 15-odd months, winning big series home and away, and this World Cup is being talked of in certain circles as their best shot at victory. Fully aware of the level of competition Scotland are up against, Mommsen sounded confident when assessing his team."I don't think we're daunted by the way they play. Obviously, the focus has very much been on the way we want to play our game tomorrow," he said. "At the same time, we know they're dangerous. It's a dangerous lineup from 1 to 11. At the same time, they're still human beings, they still can nick the ball and get caught at slip. We have to put the balls in the right areas and make sure we're able to contain them. Obviously, we can draw on that experience of coming up against West Indies, a very dangerous batting lineup with Chris Gayle, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell towards the deaths, so that was good experience and very recent for us, and we'll call upon that. We're going into this game tomorrow with a huge amount of confidence."The wicket at University Oval looks a good batting surface, but as both captains said, the angles on a small ground are what could be the deciding factor. While Mommsen felt Scotland would have to play 'smart cricket' on this ground, McCullum harked back to two ODIs played here in January with Sri Lanka, in which New Zealand made 360 and 315."Obviously, Australia is a different kettle of fish in terms of their size grounds and things like that, but I think our grounds are really, really good," he said. "They've got some quirks about them, and this one, as well, with the boundaries straight, obviously a little bit shorter, but there's certainly some getout areas, as well, for bowlers with the big boundaries, but I think the pitch looks really good. I'd expect a lot of runs, especially if we get, I guess, some clear skies over here, which I believe is forecast, then I'd expect a lot of runs, I guess, similar to the games we had against Sri Lanka down here."Hamish Gardiner, who batted at No 3 in the warm-ups and made 12 and 7, could be swapped with Freddie Coleman who batted at one-drop in the UAE last month. The bowling is unlikely to change much from those fixtures, with Scotland heavily dependent on the offspin of 31-year-old Majid Haq - only the second player from the country to cross 200 caps - and medium-pacer Alasdair Evans, with seven wickets in the warm-ups. They will, as Mommsen pointed out, expect a lot from their new-ball pair of Ian Wardlaw and Josh Davey, who earlier this year took ten wickets between them to rout Afghanistan for just 63.There have been suggestions that New Zealand could make changes for this match, but McCullum dodged that question by saying: "We're going to play our cards pretty close to our chest with the team, but all the guys are fit and available, and it's a good space for us to be in. We've got a fully fit and strong team to pick from, so we'll just work out the strategy that we want to go in with tomorrow."Probable XIsNew Zealand: 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (capt), 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Grant Elliott, 6 Corey Anderson, 7 Luke Ronchi (wk), 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Tim Southee, 10 Trent Boult, 11 Adam Milne/Mitchell McClenaghanScotland: 1 Kyle Coetzer, 2 Callum MacLeod, 3 Hamish Gardiner/Freddie Coleman, 4 Matt Machan, 5 Preston Mommsen (capt), 6 Richie Barrington, 7 Matthew Cross (wk), 8 Josh Davey, 9 Alasdair Evans, 10 Majid Haq, 11 Ian WardlawTeams:Scotland (From): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Matt Machan, Freddie Coleman, Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Preston Mommsen(c), Majid Haq, Rob Taylor, Iain Wardlaw, Safyaan Sharif, Michael Leask, Alasdair EvansNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Adam Milne, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Tom LathamLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
