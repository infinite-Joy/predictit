Here we go with the first ball...Oh no, the pitch has been covered again. There is a bit of a drizzle. Pakistan players are waiting for it to stop.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Younis Khan, Umar Akmal(w), Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Fawad Alam, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Junaid Khan, Mohammad IrfanSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Ashan Priyanjan, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith MalingaAngelo: "We wanted to bowl first as well as rain is expected later. But not too disappointed. Can't really know what is a good score on this pitch because of the conditions. For us the priority is the World Cup. It is important to get our confidence level high."Misbah: "It is overcast and we would like to bowl first. It will be good practice for the bowlers. It is good to see Shahid Afridi back. He is in a good nick and we are expecting a big contribution from him. Irfan could make a big difference. We will miss Ajmal but we will have to manage without him. It is important to win the game and the series but we also have to be ready for the World Cup. We are keeping both things in mind."Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: "There are a few cracks and a little bit of dry grass. It is a two-paced wicket with unpredictable bounce. It is good batting track. But considering the rain around, the captain winning the toss will be looking to field first in case it is a shortened game", reckons Russel Arnold.Hello and welcome to the first ODI between Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The conditions are overcast and the ground is covered. There might be a delayed start. We will bring you more news as it comes. Stay tuned...Pakistan team news is that Saeed Ajmal has left for Brisbane to undergo tests on his bowling action. Junaid, who suffered a concussion in the second Test, might be rested if he has not recovered yet. In that case, Mohammad Irfan could take his place.We have a reserve day for the first 2 ODIs. In case, the game is not completed today because of the weather, we will have a continuation tomorrow. Hopefully, the rain gods will have mercy and allow a full day's play.Russel Arnold has tweeted: Good Morning folks...It's gloomy ..the fishermen in little boats are out...locals say we should get throughSri Lanka, meanwhile, have always been strong at home. They have had a highly productive year and will be confident of taking over their sub-continent counterparts. Their spin department headed by Rangana Herath is likely to do damage on a turning Hambantota wicket. Overall, it will give both the teams a chance to boost their preparations with the World Cup looming ahead.After getting a 2-0 drubbing in the Tests, Pakistan now face Sri Lanka in a 3-match ODI series. Pakistan have a reputation of crumbling under pressure which has been evident in the last few games they have played. However, that does not mean they are inferior in any way. They have a strong batting unit in this format. The inclusion of Younis Khan after more than a year out, will certainly give them an edge.Teams:Pakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Sharjeel Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan, Sohaib Maqsood, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Zulfiqar Babar, Mohammad Irfan, Anwar Ali, Fawad Alam, Mohammad Talha, Junaid KhanSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Nuwan Kulasekara, Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Dhammika Prasad, Rangana Herath, Upul Tharanga, Seekkuge Prasanna, Suraj Randiv, Dinesh ChandimalLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
