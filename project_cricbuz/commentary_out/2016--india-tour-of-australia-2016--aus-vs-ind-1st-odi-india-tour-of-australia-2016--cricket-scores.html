AUSTRALIA:49.1 Barinder to Smith, out Caught by Kohli!! Ohh dear! Smith is a disappointed man as he misses out on his 150 by a solitary run. Nevertheless, it has been a brilliant knock from the Australian skipper. Walks back to a standing ovation from the crowd, waves his bat around to soak in the applause. Coming to the ball, it was the off-pace delivery from Sran, completely outfoxed Smith, who pushes at it with hard hands, ends up spooning it straight to Kohli at short cover. The easiest of catches for him. Out comes finisher Faulkner. Smith c Kohli b Barinder 149(135) [4s-11 6s-2]Barinder to Smith, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Barinder Sran [9.0-0-54-2] is back into the attack

AUSTRALIA:41.5 Ashwin to Bailey, out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! In the air, oh that has popped out but Bhuvi has managed to hold on. Excellent catch at the long-off fence. Bailey walks off to a standing ovation. Now is there a twist in the tale? Finally, something works for Ashwin. I must tell you that this was more a fielder's wicket. Flighted delivery just outside off stump, Bailey advances and loft-drives it hard, hits it flat, Bhuvi runs to his right from long-off and tries to reverse-cup it after jumping in the air, couldn't control it and it came out of his hands but he managed to grab the rebound. End of an excellent innings from Bailey and end of an excellent 242-run stand as well. I must remind you that he got lucky very early in his innings as the umpire didn't not give it favour of Sran, when he gloved one first ball to Dhoni.

AUSTRALIA:39.2 Barinder to Smith, FOUR, a flat-batted pull and mid-on wasn't good enough! Shortish and outside off stump, not high enough to trouble the batsman, Smith muscles it down the ground, mid-on dives but loses the battle. Meanwhile, this is now Smith's highest ODI score. PB: 105 against the same opposition in that World Cup semi-final that I was talking about earlier

AUSTRALIA:38.5 U Yadav to Smith, FOUR, wow! An Indian bowler tries a yorker. Although this wasn't quite a yorker, credit to Umesh for at least trying one. Very full on the stumps, Smith backs away and drives hard, Ashwin runs to his left from mid-on and dives, but in vain

AUSTRALIA:38.3 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Bailey chops it to backward point

AUSTRALIA:38.1 U Yadav to Smith, 1 run, tell him that he's playing against India and he'll say he can score a hundred even before the start of the game. What a player! The captain leads from the front and it's his 5th ODI hundred, back-to-back hundreds for Smith against Dhoni and Co. Remember, he got one in the all important World Cup semi-final on March 26, 2015. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, Smith works it behind square and gets to his milestone. Gets a great applause from the crowd and he raises his bat, before shaking hands with his partner
AUSTRALIA:37.6 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Smith guides it to third man
AUSTRALIA:37.5 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, 2 runs, poor stuff from India. Dhoni let this throw go through thinking someone was backing up, but Kohli was not there and Smith gets an extra run. Full and on the leg stump, Smith clips it away to long leg, should have been a single, but the overthrow gets his back on strike
AUSTRALIA:37.4 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, FOUR, way too short and on leg stump line as well, Smith swivels and pulls behind square on the on-side, Umesh Yadav gives chase from fine leg, but he had too much distance to cover

AUSTRALIA:37.1 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, 1 run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Smith misses the flick, the ball takes the inside edge and rolls to point off the thigh padDrinks are on the field now. These two are emulating what Rohit and Kohli did for India. At the moment, they look inseparable and Australia are cruising, needing 91 off 78 balls. With Maxwell, Marsh, Wade and Finisher Faulkner to follow, practical sense would say that Australia are firm favourites. However, we've seen many miracles in this game of cricket and Dhoni and Co. desperately want one at the moment. You can concede runs, but you can't spray the ball around like how they have today and that will be Dhoni's biggest worry.
AUSTRALIA:36.6 U Yadav to Smith, leg byes, 1 run, that's a wild slog across the line and he misses, hit in line with the sticks, but the WACA bounce was taking it over the stumps. Would have been out on many other grounds. The impact was on middle stump and it rolled towards third man off the thigh pad
AUSTRALIA:36.5 U Yadav to Smith, no run, now the bumper from Umesh, Smith backed away and then tried to ramp it over the keeper but missed it
AUSTRALIA:36.4 U Yadav to Smith, 2 runs, slower delivery outside off stump, can't say that Smith had this under control, went a little early into the drive and then waited for a second to send it past backward point. Credit to him though for not hitting it in the air

AUSTRALIA:36.2 U Yadav to Smith, 1 run, now that was bowled at 138kph, but Smith was so still and just opened the face of the bat at the last moment to guide it to third man and made it look as if that came at 100kph

AUSTRALIA:35.3 Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, 1 run, once again tapped towards short cover
AUSTRALIA:35.2 Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, 2 runs, Bhuvi is Bailey's best friend now, this was just a single, but the bowler, in view of a run-out concedes an extra run and helps Bailey to get to his hundred. 3rd ODI hundred for Bails! He raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from the crowd. No great celebration from him. Just a raise of the bat and he gets a hug from his skipper. Good length delivery just outside off stump, Bailey taps it to the left of the bowler, Bhuvi has a needless shy at the striker's end and misses the sticks
AUSTRALIA:35.1 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, 1 run, good length delivery on the stumps, Smith flicks it to deep mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:34.6 U Yadav to Bailey, no run, oh that was close. The incoming delivery is going to pose some problems to Bailey, who is having a strange closed stance.

The debutant Sran, who was impressive till he unhinged both openers, slightly got carried away to dish out some short-pitched bowling. Enabled this pair to get going. India's go-to-man Ashwin trundles in now...No slip for him
AUSTRALIA:16.6 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, steered down to third man. And that will usher in drinks

AUSTRALIA:14.5 U Yadav to Bailey, no run, leading edge, was it? Whatever it was, spooned only for a little while before landing beside the pitch. Back of a length on middle, Bailey closes the bat-face too early. Hit him high as well before popping up for a brief period

AUSTRALIA:12.4 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, Bailey is in pain, still called through for a non-existent run, and has to put in a full length dive. A direct-hit and he was gone!

AUSTRALIA:11.5 Rohit to Bailey, SIX, and bang! Unless Rohit pulls out a pipedream in the last ball, safe to say this move to bring him on hasn't worked. Bailey sees the flight, ventures down and launches it straight back. Way over the sight-screen she goes

AUSTRALIA:9.5 Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, no run, steered to backward pointBailey is employing a very strange stance here. Way too closed. So much so that his front foot is on off-stump while the back-foot is outside leg.
AUSTRALIA:9.4 Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, no run, all back of a length from Bhuvneshwar after that first ball. Punched to cover

AUSTRALIA:7.2 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, a flat-footed defence towards cover
AUSTRALIA:7.1 Bhuvneshwar to Bailey, 1 run, this is just bizarre. Pandemonium at the WACA. There could have been atleast three run-outs here. In the end, there was none. Punched straight back, Bhuvneshwar bends low to get fingertips on it. Misses the stumps and rolls down to mid-on. The fielder misses the stumps at the non-striker's end as a single is attempted. Needed a direct-hit to catch Smith short at the keeper's end which wasn't possible. Got it?

AUSTRALIA:5.6 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, no run, back of a length delivery around off, tapped back down the pitch from the crease
AUSTRALIA:5.5 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, no run, a splice-jarring length ball. Might have rapped on the gloves as well. Just took off from a good length as Smith committed to the forward defence. Did well to take his bottom hand off to control it down
AUSTRALIA:5.5 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, wide, another very, very short ball. He's banging it too far down while going for the bouncer
AUSTRALIA:5.4 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, 2 runs, lovely square drive. Nowhere near a half-volley. Smith plonked across and hit it on the up through the point region. Easy couple before its hounded down

AUSTRALIA:4.6 Barinder to Bailey, no run, angled away outside off, left alone
AUSTRALIA:4.5 Barinder to Bailey, no run, what's happened here? Dhoni doesn't look convinced and there is only an enquiry about a strangle down leg. Back of a length on leg-stump, Bailey swivels across looking to help the jab fine, late on the shot and the ball takes some glove through to the keeper. Hot-Spot has come up with a mark. And Bailey is very, very luckyGeorge Bailey, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:4.4 Barinder to Warner, out Caught by Kohli!! Sran is punching the air, giving Warner a piece of his mind, and completely overcome with delight. Ooooh, sledging Warner eh? He can do what he wants now. Pitched up outside off and smashed .. straight to mid-off. Absolutely caned the drive but didn't bother to keep it down and failed to clear Kohli, who timed his leap to perfection and cupped it in front of his face. Warner c Kohli b Barinder 5(10) [4s-1]Barinder to Warner, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:4.3 Barinder to Smith, 1 run, pivots on the back foot and controls the pull all the way down to fine leg

AUSTRALIA:2.6 Barinder to Warner, no run, length ball which is driven on the up towards backward point
AUSTRALIA:2.5 Barinder to Warner, FOUR, ooooh, reckon that might have been close had he missed. But he didn't. Back of a length delivery headed towards middle, Warner moves across on the hop, and glances it fine
AUSTRALIA:2.4 Barinder to Smith, 1 run, back of a length delivery pushed across the right-hander, Smith angles it down to third man. The Aussie skipper is awaySteven Smith, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:2.3 Barinder to Finch, out Caught&Bowled!! Well, those stars didn't stand watch over him for too long, did they? But it's Sran's moment. Let me not take it away. Maiden ODI wicket. Wow, always something you can tell your grandkids about. And how cool is he with his celebrations! Pitched up outside off, Finch goes with hard hands on the drive, the bat face turns and he drags it in the air off the inside half of the bat. It was low to Sran's right, he bent low and went with both hands. And it stuck. Finch c and b Barinder 8(11) [4s-1]Barinder to Finch, THAT'S OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!
AUSTRALIA:2.2 Barinder to Finch, FOUR, chopped on, has he? Oh no. It's missed off stump by a hair's breadth and sped away. Not too short to cut, cramped for room as well, thank your stars
AUSTRALIA:2.1 Barinder to Finch, no run, kissing the deck on a back of a length while slanting it away outside off, Finch holds his bat aloft
AUSTRALIA:1.6 Bhuvneshwar to Finch, 1 run, short of length delivery skidding on towards the hips, tucks it in front of mid-wicket off the thigh pad. Easy single. I saw the umpire patting his leg to signal a leg bye but it has been given as runs
AUSTRALIA:1.5 Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run, hooping away on a length outside off, left alone
AUSTRALIA:1.4 Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run, angled into the pads, clipped to mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:1.3 Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run, a loud grunt in bemusement, clearly heard on the stump mic.

Didn't quite get up as much as he wanted, sneaked under the bottom edge through to the keeper
AUSTRALIA:1.3 Bhuvneshwar to Finch, wide, falling down the leg-side, didn't quite come out properly from the wrists. Finch couldn't connect wth his flick

AUSTRALIA:1.1 Bhuvneshwar to Finch, no run, we'll get more of this with Bhuvi on the horizon. Full pitched delivery swinging away from off, Finch lazily drives it on the walk back down the pitchBhuvneshwar Kumar, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
AUSTRALIA:0.6 Barinder to Warner, no run, slipping down the leg-side, goes on with the arm rather than shape away, Warner glances it to short fine leg

AUSTRALIA:0.2 Barinder to Finch, 1 run, short of length again and on the body. Another fierce pull short behind square but this one is straight at fine leg
AUSTRALIA:0.1 Barinder to Finch, 2 runs, and short straightaway. Not the pace to cause any trouble though. Nor the height. Finch swivels smoothly and pulls it from the mid-riff behind square. Fine leg cuts it off quick enough but they take one on the throw. Brilliant runningFinch and Warner are at the crease. Finch is on strike. Barinder will open the attackWelcome back for the chase. The last time India were playing ODIs in Australia, it was in the World Cup. There, they used the short ball to good effect. Actually, the pacers were quite instrumental with it. Their bowling attack is not quite the same with Shami and Mohit nowhere to be seen. Will be interesting to see if the same ploy is adopted. Finch and Warner are out there looking hungry. Looking to be fed some. Here's the debutant from round the wicket..Meanwhile, Mitchell Johnson is doing a lap around the WACA with his daughter to loud cheers from his zillion fans. Perth remembers its favourite son. It remembers all those triumphs. All the brutality. Anyway, coming to the cricket, India should be full of belief. Onus is now on the hosts to meet fire with fire. The pitch is a good one. Coming on nicely. And I reckon we have a match on our hands. Join us in half an hour.The duo went about their business nonchalantly and started racking it up with effortless ease with both trying to match the other. Far too many half-vollies driven to the fence, cuts flayed over the field, and those nice wristy whips on display as well. The platform was laid for a death-overs hurrah with a 207-run stand - the highest ever for the second wicket (for India against Australia). Despite Kohli selflessly holing out in the 90s for the team's cause, Rohit stood firm and blazed away to an undefeated 171 eventually shepherding India to over 300.There weren't any monster-balls. Or a lot of rip-snorters. In the absence of an injured Starc, the retired Johnson, or someone like Pat Cummins, Australia's quicks weren't quick enough. Just seemed to lack that venom which used to be indigenous to this country. Weren't the Indians happy? Rohit Sharma stood there embodying his usual grace, intermitted with some kamikaze strokeplay and showed once again why he is such a brilliant ODI player. It's wasn't him alone though. After Dhawan was inevitably bounced out, Virat Kohli strode out like a man with a purpose. And played like one.Australia have bowled their overs on time. Rohit Sharma gets a great ovation from the crowd as he walks off the field and he's congratulated by Jadeja.4
INDIA:49.6 Boland to Rohit, 1 run, Boland signs off in style with a yorker outside off stump, Rohit tried to squeeze it through the off-side, got an inside edge rolled towards the on-side

INDIA:49.3 Boland to Rohit, SIX, another full toss, the third full toss Boland has bowled to Rohit Sharma in his last two overs and all three have been muscled by the Mumbaikar for maximums! Rohit went deep in the crease expecting a yorker, but Boland offered him a gift, Rohit went over long-on and that went a long way beyond the rope. Looks like Rohit has broken his bat with that shot
INDIA:49.2 Boland to Rohit, FOUR, top edge and looks like it has gone all the way? That's cruel for the bowler. No, it has just landed in front. Low full toss outside off stump, Rohit went down on one knee to sweep, got a top edge and it flew over Wade and almost went for a maximum. 300 up for India
INDIA:49.1 Boland to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, full and on the stumps, Jadeja drives it along the ground to long-offLast over of the innings. How many can India get?
INDIA:48.6 Faulkner to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, once again full and wide from Faulkner, Jadeja square-drives it to sweeper cover, wants two but Rohit wasn't keen

INDIA:48.4 Faulkner to Ravindra Jadeja, 3 runs, the widish yorker, but Jadeja reaches out and squeezes it out through point, the fielder dives but it escapes. Now they are rushing back for the third run as well. Great running by Jadeja, he pushed his partner there

INDIA:48.2 Faulkner to Dhoni, out Caught by Boland!! Good catch by Boland. In fact the replay shows that even though he went with two hands, he took it with his right hand. Short of a length delivery from Faulkner, probably the slower delivery from the all-rounder, Dhoni mistimed the pull, more from the bottom of the bat, the fielder at mid-wicket dived to his right and plucked it out of thin air. This could make a difference of 10-15 runs to the final total. Dhoni c Boland b Faulkner 18(13) [4s-1 6s-1]Faulkner to Dhoni, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Rohit Sharma is now the fastest to score 1000 runs in ODIs against Australia. He got there in 19 innings. Got it ahead of Tendulkar and Lara

INDIA:47.5 Boland to Rohit, SIX, Boland is getting his yorkers right to MS Dhoni, but he's bowling low full tosses to Rohit Sharma. Another low full toss and Rohit goes downtown over long-on, for a moment it looked as if he was going to pick the fieldsman out in the deep but it cleared him

INDIA:47.2 Boland to Rohit, SIX, now he's missed the yorker and that's a juicy low full toss, Rohit waits for the ball to come and flicks it away nicely from the middle of the bat, the ball clears the mid-wicket fence quite comfortably. He moves on to 149 with that hit
INDIA:47.1 Boland to Dhoni, 1 run, fine yorker from the 26-year-old, Dhoni could only dig it out towards wide mid-on, the fielder in the deep rushed and prevented the second runScott Boland [8.0-0-44-0] is back into the attackGreat over for India. 15 off it. 3 overs to go and 31 more for 300! Boland comes on now. Remember, he's been picked for his ability to bowl perfect yorkers at the death. Bowling to Dhoni is going to be a challenge for him. Let's see how it goes!
INDIA:46.6 Faulkner to Rohit, 2 runs, short of length delivery on the off stump, Rohit turns it to backward square leg and they race back for the second
INDIA:46.5 Faulkner to Rohit, FOUR, gee! Innovative hit from Rohit and he's connected well. Good length delivery angling in around off stump line, Rohit moved across the stumps and scooped it over the infield, fine leg was back near the rope but he was too squareThird man is inside the ring

INDIA:46.2 Faulkner to Dhoni, SIX, in the airrrr and that's gone all the way! Faulkner misses his length by a yard or so and that was in the slot for the skipper to tee off. He went over long-off with the lofted drive after jumping out of the crease and picked up a maximum
INDIA:46.1 Faulkner to Rohit, 1 run, excellent bowling, Rohit exposed all three sticks as he backed away, from round the wicket Faulkner followed the batsman with a short of length delivery, Rohit could only punch it towards cover-point
INDIA:45.6 Hazlewood to Rohit, 1 run, back of a length outside off stump, Rohit late-cuts it to the right of third man, probably the second run was on, but they don't go for it. Rohit must be a tired man, remember, he's batting on 135

INDIA:45.1 Hazlewood to Dhoni, no run, Wade takes the catch down the leg-side and throws the ball up in the air thinking Dhoni is out, Hazlewood appeals but umpire Richard Kettleborough was unmoved. Dhoni was going nowhere as well. Top call Kettleborough! That was off the thigh pad. Short of a length delivery down the leg-side, Dhoni missed the fine pull on that occasion, it was so close to taking the glove there
INDIA:44.6 Faulkner to Dhoni, 1 run, good length delivery on the leg stump, Dhoni waits for the ball to come and glances it down to fine leg. He'll keep strike with that single
INDIA:44.5 Faulkner to Dhoni, FOUR, now round the wicket and Faulkner loses his radar. Short and on the leg stump, don't bowl short to Dhoni. He's good with his pull/hook! Dhoni swivels and pulls it fine, long leg was very square and he was not even in the picture. So the Indian skipper opens his account in style
INDIA:44.4 Faulkner to Dhoni, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Dhoni wants to cut hard, only manages to toe-end it to coverMS Dhoni, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:44.3 Faulkner to Kohli, out Caught by Finch!! That is an unselfish shot in the 90s and Kohli has holed out. He wanted to hit a maximum and long-on moved to his left to take a good catch. Full ball from Faulkner, Kohli advanced and hit it very hard, the timing was so good, just that it didn't have enough height on it, the fielder was close to the rope there, but he did well to take it calmly. So that ends a terrific 207-run stand and a magnificent knock from India's No. 3. He gets a good ovation from the crowd as he walks off as well.

Rohit jumped out of the crease and got into an awkward position to loft this short of length delivery, he wanted to muscle it back over the bowler's head/mid-on, but hit him high on the bat and lobbed just behind the unmanned mid-off region. The fielder in the deep rushed, but it dropped well in front of him
INDIA:44.1 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, slower delivery from round the wicket, bowled wide outside off stump as well, Rohit tries to cut but made no contact with the ballJames Faulkner [7.0-0-29-0] is back into the attackSix overs left. India need 58 more to get to 300. Can they do it?

It wasn't timed too well, but had enough to go over the rope
INDIA:23.2 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, no run, slightly back of a length and in the channel just outside off, Rohit stands tall, opens the face of the blade and pushes it to backward point

The no came a little late, but Kohli was able to make his ground in time with a dive before the throw arrived at the non-striker's end
INDIA:22.2 Maxwell to Rohit, no run, comes down the track, doesn't get to the pitch of the ball and ends up defending this in front of cover

INDIA:21.6 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, Kohli comes across and works it towards mid-on, the fielder does well to quickly get across and fires in the throw at the non-striker's end as Kohli was charging across. Even though there was a direct-hit, the batsman was home comfortably. The ball gets deflected off the stumps and rolls away towards the fine leg fence, the man from third man gets across, puts in the dive and saves a boundary. The Indians could manage just an extra run in the meantime. Kohli wasn't too happy with Rohit there, he wanted at least one more run but Rohit was a little slow
INDIA:21.5 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, no run, length delivery in the channel outside off, Kohli bends low, opens the face of the blade and bunts it straight to backward point

INDIA:20.1 Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run, pitched up right in the slot outside off, Kohli comes on the front foot and drills it to the left of mid-off, where Warner dives across and gets a hand on it, saves three runs for his team but couldn't prevent the single
INDIA:19.6 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, 1 run, watch it. Watch it. These two have a history. Not a very fond one. Kohli taps it wide of cover and sets off. Rohit responds and the single is completed. There was a shy at the non-striker's end but Kohli made it
INDIA:19.5 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, no run, length delivery outside off, leaves it for the keeper
INDIA:19.4 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, no run, closer to off and not a problem. Forward and defended
INDIA:19.3 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, no run, no. No, no, no. Not there please. Back of a length delivery wide of off, Kohli senses the cryptonite. Goes groping after it anyway. Beaten on the edge. Next time might not be so lucky
INDIA:19.2 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, 1 run, fifty for Rohit! Greeted with a discernible applause from this WACA crowd. Lazes across towards his mate and gets a solid handshake. Got to the milestone with another easy glide down to third man. Now stay there and carry on
INDIA:19.1 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, 1 run, length delivery around two-three stumps outside off, Kohli moves across and pushes it on the up through the cover regionMitchell Marsh [2.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:18.6 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, fullish and driven gently to mid-on
INDIA:18.5 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, only a fraction full and Rohit latches onto it with a front foot punch. Only that he couldn't get it past the Australian skipper at short extra cover. Flew to his right, parallel to the ground, and stuck his hand out to make a half-stop
INDIA:18.4 Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run, pushed across Kohli on a back of a length, he runs it nicely down to third man
INDIA:18.3 Faulkner to Rohit, 1 run, allows the ball to come on, and then dabs it from under his eyes down to third man
INDIA:18.2 Faulkner to Rohit, 2 runs, Rohit and the pull. They have been like poetry so far. Not this one though. Fetched it from over his right shoulder, couldn't quite keep it down but there's no one at square leg. Would have been over him anyway. Lands well short and wide of the chasing deep square leg fielder
INDIA:18.1 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, leaving the right-hander on a good length, Rohit stays flat-footed and steers it towards point
INDIA:17.6 Boland to Rohit, 1 run, stays rooted to the crease to a back of a length delivery angled in. Might have been dodgy as he played round it. Manages to get bat and work it down to fine leg
INDIA:17.5 Boland to Rohit, no run, big stride forward, uses his long reach well and blocks
INDIA:17.4 Boland to Kohli, 1 run, bowling too straight for my liking. Well, for Smith's liking. Allowing the strike to rotate. Kohli feasts on the snack with a clip through mid-wicket

INDIA:17.2 Boland to Rohit, no run, pitched right up just outside off, Rohit moves across and softly punches it back down the pitch

Collects a leg-bye as it rolls away off the thigh padI bet India would have taken this at the toss. First match on an overseas tour. Not to mention at the WACA. 82/1 in 17, yeah you will be quite happy. Kohli has settled in well after Shikhar's misery ended. Also, Rohit is looking a million bucks right now.Drinks are on the field now
INDIA:16.6 Faulkner to Kohli, 1 run, another nice little dab down to third man. Time for the players to take drinks
INDIA:16.5 Faulkner to Kohli, no run, tucked from off-stump wide of short mid-wicket. Fielding is never a problem with Australia. Throw themselves around like their bodies are made of rubber

INDIA:15.2 Boland to Kohli, no run, back of a length delivery angled in on middle, tucked to short mid-wicket
INDIA:15.1 Boland to Kohli, no run, that's more like it. Stick to what you know. Banged in short, whirs over Kohli's left ear as he swayed inside the line of it. Dropped his gloves wellVishaal has this to say about the crowd at the WACA: 'The crowd has steadily built up and it looks so much more fuller now. Quite a bit of noise as well.'
INDIA:14.6 Faulkner to Rohit, FOUR, whattay shot! The Aussies have been guilty of this. Too many half-vollies on offer today. All Rohit had to do was to hit the gap after leaning towards the ball. Punched it with a firm bottom hand straight of mid-on
INDIA:14.5 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, back of a length delivery which Rohit drops with soft hands in front of cover point. The fielder charged in to prevent the faintest idea of a single

INDIA:13.1 Boland to Kohli, FOUR, Boland will soon learn that there are some things you can do. And there are some things you can't. Just a no-no. Bowling on Kohli's pads is one of those. That too a half-volley. Okay not quite on the pads but it's enough. Whipped wide of mid-on
INDIA:12.6 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, no run, stands on his toes to match the spongy bounce of this short of length delivery outside off, steers it to backward point

INDIA:9.5 Joel Paris to Kohli, no run, angled across from a length, Kohli doesn't bother with it

Full and swinging in ever so slightly, Rohit gets across and flicks wide of mid-on to get off the markRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. Hazlewood will open the attackThe players are out for the national anthems. It is a bit windy at the WACA. Looks a bit cloudy but yeah fast bowlers will be licking their lips under these conditions. Speaking of fast bowlers Joel Samuel Paris, the lanky left-arm pacer, who replaced Mitchell Starc got his wish true. A debut on his home ground that is. "A very good morning" greets Harsha Bhogle on air who adds there is a bit of drizzle around. Josh Hazlewood will start the 5-match ODI series. Two slips in place for him...So Ishant is left out. Remember, he had a minor cut on his index finger on his bowling hand. He did not bowl in both the warm-up games and only bowled a long spell in the second half of the team's training session yesterday. Probably that is the reason why he has been left out.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Barinder SranAustralia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, Scott Boland, Josh Hazlewood, Joel ParisSmith: "I was actually thinking about bowling because of the overhead conditions. We have got some young exciting talent in Joel Paris and Scott Boland, they are making their debuts. James Faulkner makes a comeback as well. We have played well in the last couple of years and I am confident that we can play well in this series and stay No. 1 in the world."Dhoni: "We have decided to bat first. Usually it is quite dry and hot here, but it's good to have a bit of cloud cover. It was good to have a couple of practice games here. It is always exciting to have new faces in the side. It's good to be here (in Australia). People love competitive cricket."India have won the toss and have opted to batToss time folks! Both Smith and Dhoni are ready.Death bowling has been India's biggest problem and during their training, the pacers were seriously addressing the issue. In fact, they took a leaf out of Lasith Malinga's book and practiced hard by placing a pair of shoes near the batting crease to get their yorkers right.Vishaal Loganathan, who is at the ground, delights us with this update. "It was drizzling earlier, but it has stopped now and the covers are off. Both teams are warming-up."Australia have already announced their XI. With Mitchell Johnson retiring and Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins out with injuries, Steven Smith's side will have two debutants in Joel Paris and Scott Boland. Here is their playing XI: Warner, Finch, Smith, Bailey, Maxwell, Marsh, Wade, Faulkner, Boland, Paris, Hazlewood. Shifting focus to the Indian team, we are hearing that MS Dhoni has just handed the debut cap to Barinder Sran. Either of Pandey or Gurkeerat were expected to take the No. 6 spot in the batting-order. Looking at the fact that only Barinder was handed the cap, one assumes that Pandey has been picked for this ODI.India's last ODI assignment was their home series against South Africa. Things did not go according to plan though as the Men in Blue lost 2-3 to the Proteas. On the other hand, Australia last played an ODI series back in September, when they successfully overpowered England in their own backyard after the 2015 Ashes. As said earlier, a lot has changed for both sides since then, thanks to injuries, retirement and poor form."I feel it's a bilateral series where a lot of new individuals will get a chance. So it will be very exciting." These were MS Dhoni's words at the pre-match press conference. Good morning everyone and welcome to the first game of the 5-match ODI series. There have been a lot of change in personnel in both sides from their last series. For India, the likes of Raina, Rayudu, Mohit, Harbhajan, Mishra and Binny are missing. Jadeja, Ishant, return to the side, while the selectors have also included fresh faces like Manish Pandey, Rishi Dhawan and Barinder Sran.Preview by Vishaal LoganathanThe atmosphere in Perth ahead of the opener of the ODI series between the top two ODI teams in the world could not be more different than if it was played in India. The sleepy town of Perth exudes a feeling of complacence and contentment, and it almost feels like no one knows Australia are facing off against India. But the men who truly matter know it's on...India and Australia return to the ground they enjoyed playing in, during the World Cup. India won big against the UAE before seeing off a defiant West Indies side in their final league game. Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohd Shami all enjoyed good outings at the WACA. Australia, on the other hand, racked up a record 417/6 against Afghanistan on the back of some superb hitting from David Warner, Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell. Five of the aforementioned six players are sure to take the field during the opener on Tuesday (January 12).The last time these two sides met was at Sydney, as semi-finalists of the Word Cup, where Australia ended India's reign as World Champions. The rivalry between the sides has already been talked up much, and with a number of youngsters coming into the sides, the series has all the ingredients of a enthralling affair.Date and time: 12th January, 11:20 AM Local Time, 8:50 AM ISTWeather: Showers predicted during the morningVenue: WACA, PerthTeam Details:India: MS Dhoni has already mentioned that one of Gurukeerat Singh Mann or Manish Pandey will bat in the lower-middle order. The top-order selects itself, but it will interesting to see where Ajinkya Rahane fits in. The right-hander did not find himself with a concrete spot in the top four during the series against South Africa despite being in good form.Pandey or Mann could take up the position vacated by Suresh Raina, but there is the possibility of MS Dhoni moving up the order and asking a debutant to bat lower down. Mann bowls some handy off-spin and is more experienced playing the big hitting role down the order. However, India might just prefer a specialist in that position and it puts Manish Pandey higher up the pecking order.With the pitch at the WACA likely to offer the pacers assistance, the Indian think-tank will be wary of playing two spinners. However, the side did well when they had both Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin in the line-up for the games they played in Perth last year. During the pre-game conference MS Dhoni said he preferred playing three pacers and two spinners.Barinder Sran should be in line for his debut having performed reasonably well during the practice matches.Probable XI: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni, Manish Pandey Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Barinder SranAustralia: The hosts will be going in with an all-out pace attack, with Scott Boland and Joel Paris debuting for the hosts. Josh Hazlewood, James Faulkner and Mitchell Marsh make up the rest of the bowling line-up, with Glenn Maxwell as a back-up spin option. The batting is on expected lines with Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steve Smith and George Bailey making up the top four.With two debutants, Australia's bowling does have a shade of inexperience around it. However, as Smith suggests, Perth is probably the best place for a fast bowler to make a debut. Homeboy Joel Paris ought to know the conditions quite well while Boland walks in with huge expectations. The righ-arm seamer is expected to play a key role in the death overs while left-arm seamers Joel Paris and Faulkner add that bit of variety in an all-pace attack.Playing XI: David Warner, Aaron Finch, Steve Smith, George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade, James Faulkner, Scott Boland, Joel Paris, Josh Hazlewood.Quotes:We've had a look [at the pitch]. It's tradition that we can use a left-armer here who can use the breeze and swing the ball. So, hopefully they'll be able to do that. The wicket looks like it'll be a good one: Steve Smith.We should stick to our strengths. Australians' strength is in their pace bowlers and they are going in with their strengths. We are likely to play two spinners and three pacers: MS DhoniTeams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Manish Pandey, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Barinder Sran, Ishant Sharma, Axar Patel, Rishi Dhawan, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Bhuvneshwar KumarAustralia (From): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, Scott Boland, Josh Hazlewood, Joel Paris, Shaun Marsh, Kane RichardsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
