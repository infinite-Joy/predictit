Once they learnt how to play hockey, India is considered a minnow in hockey. Still remember the days of Floris Bovelander who terrorised opposition with his drag flicks.

Kohli b Borren 12(20) [4s-2] Borren to Kohli, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Yusuf Pathan, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:7.3  Seelaar to Sehwag, out Caught by Kervezee!! That's the end of Sehwag's cameo! He tried going for one too many, made a bit of room looking to go over the infield towards the off side, ended up slicing it straight to Kervezee at point, pin drop silence at Kotla, it took a moment for them to realise that it has cleanly carried to the man. Sehwag c Kervezee b Seelaar 39(26) [4s-5 6s-2] Seelaar to Sehwag, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:7.2  Seelaar to Sehwag, FOUR!!, terrific! That's sensible thinking from Sehwag, opens the face of the bat slightly and runs it between the keeper and short third man, the ball slowly rolls away and wins the race
INDIA:7.1  Seelaar to Sehwag, SIX!!, that's Sehwag's style of dancing! Saw the ball tossed up, Sehwag shimmies down the wicket and goes inside out over mid off, wide of mid off to be precise, the ball goes rolling towards the boundary ropes, this man is on fire!
INDIA:6.6  Bukhari to Sehwag, 1 run, Sehwag didn't quite time that well enough, went back and pulled it through mid wicket, hit that along the ground, the man at deep mid moves to his left, it will only be a single
INDIA:6.5  Bukhari to Tendulkar, 1 run, Tendulkar puts his front leg across and flicks it towards mid wicket
INDIA:6.4  Bukhari to Sehwag, 1 run, steps down the wicket this time looking to pull, the ball hurried onto him, he ends up cross batting it to Eric at mid on, slightly wide of him though, takes a single
INDIA:6.3  Bukhari to Sehwag, SIX!!, It's time for some fireworks at Kotla, it was a rank half-tracker, Sehwag goes back and pulls it in the air, struck right out of the meat of the blade and the crowd in the stands at deep mid wicket will have some catching to do, the DJ plays some Punjabi music in the background and the people are loving it
INDIA:6.2  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, Sehwag punches this one down the wicket, didn't hit that with a lot of force, mid on moves to his left to stop the single
INDIA:6.1  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, much better this time around, on the middle stump, slightly short of a good length, Sehwag goes back and defends it to the on side
INDIA:6.1  Bukhari to Sehwag, wide, the Dutch have had problems with erring in line, short of a good length and going down the leg, Sehwag watches the keeper move to his left to collect it
INDIA:5.6  Seelaar to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, there was a man positioned at leg gully, not too close in though, Sunil Gavaskar was mentioning on air that it does not qualify to be a catching position, Tendulkar tucks it just wide of that man Bukhari, he fell to his right but couldn't stop it, another boundary, the Indians are off for a rollicking start
INDIA:5.5  Seelaar to Tendulkar, no run, flatter one on off, Tendulkar pushes it to cover
INDIA:5.4  Seelaar to Tendulkar, no run, Tendulkar gets a long way across looking to paddle sweep that, struck on the pad just outside the off stump, a muted appeal from the bowler, it dies down quickly
INDIA:5.3  Seelaar to Sehwag, 1 run, well tossed up, Sehwag drives it to long off, single taken
INDIA:5.2  Seelaar to Tendulkar, 1 run, drags it a touch short, Tendulkar goes back and goes for the short arm pull towards deep mid wicket
INDIA:5.1  Seelaar to Tendulkar, no run, starts off with a flighted delivery around the off stump, Tendulkar gets forward and taps it towards coverPieter Seelaar, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
INDIA:4.6  Bukhari to Sehwag, FOUR!!, catch dropped!! Szwarczynski the man, too hard to get the spelling right but I hope I have, Sehwag pulled the short ball in the air, it was a tough one to be honest, the fielder made a mistake by leaping and looking to take it with his right hand, he had to go with both hands perhaps, the ball touches his fingertips and rolls behind to the long on boundary. Oh yeah, Szwarczynski was the same man whom Ganguly called Swarovski earlier today
INDIA:4.5  Bukhari to Sehwag, FOUR!!, not convincing this time around! Sehwag came down the track, Bukhari did well by dragging it a touch back, the face of the bat turned in his hand and it went off the inside half of the bat, wide of the man at short fine, he will get a boundary
INDIA:4.4  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, fuller again, Sehwag drives it back towards the bowler who stops it on his follow-through
INDIA:4.3  Bukhari to Sehwag, FOUR!!, if Tendulkar's straight drive earlier this innings was something to admire, this was even better, fuller, off and middle line, Sehwag drives hard, it goes straight between mid off and mid on, the ball had FOUR written all over it right when it left the bat
INDIA:4.2  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, more similar to the previous one, Sehwag goes back, pushes it to the off side presenting the full face of the bat
INDIA:4.1  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, Sehwag gets behind the line of the delivery and defends the back of a length delivery with the full face
INDIA:4.1  Bukhari to Sehwag, wide, good length delivery angling in, pitched on middle and goes sliding down the leg, wide called!
INDIA:3.6  Doeschate to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, he has decided to step up the gas right at the start of the innings, gets to 2000 runs in World Cups with that lofted hit over mid on, one bounce over the ropes!
INDIA:3.5  Doeschate to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, make it two in a row! Even better this time around, it was overpitched outside the off stump, Tendulkar leans forward and drives with the open face, the fielder at cover just stood and admired that shot, no way he would have stopped that one
INDIA:3.4  Doeschate to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, giving this man width is the biggest mistake that one can do! There were two men close to each other near the cover region but he did well to place it to perfection, a text book cover drive and Tendulkar will get a boundary
INDIA:3.3  Doeschate to Sehwag, 1 run, width on offer, Sehwag goes after it with minimum feet movement, gets an outside edge and the ball goes rolling down to third man
INDIA:3.3  Doeschate to Sehwag, wide, lands on a length and slides down the leg as Sehwag fails to tuck it, Doeschate appeals to get away with the wide, but umpire Steve Davies reckons Sehwag didn't get any bat on that one, wide signalled!
INDIA:3.3  Doeschate to Sehwag, wide, Doeschate tries his slower one, errs in line, it was rightly signalled wide!
INDIA:3.2  Doeschate to Sehwag, no run, does not get the pull right! It was short but Sehwag was a touch late into the shot, the ball went in the air but landed well short of the man at mid on
INDIA:3.1  Doeschate to Sehwag, no run, high backlift, Sehwag struck that with tremendous power, it was full and was in the slot, but unfortunately, the ball went racing straight to the fielder at mid off
INDIA:2.6  Bukhari to Tendulkar, no run, good tight over that, just one run off it, angled this one in towards Tendulkar who got forward only to defend it to the left of the bowler
INDIA:2.5  Bukhari to Tendulkar, no run, length delivery in the channel outside the off stump, Tendulkar gets forward and pushes it slightly wide of the man at cover, Sehwag is not interested in taking the single
INDIA:2.4  Bukhari to Tendulkar, no run, Tendulkar is moving his feet pretty well, looks to be in fine nick, he comes on the frontfoot and drives the fuller ball to the mid off fielder
INDIA:2.3  Bukhari to Tendulkar, no run, Tendulkar gets forward and punches this one straight to the fielder at point
INDIA:2.2  Bukhari to Sehwag, 1 run, Tendulkar had a word with Sehwag before this delivery, may be something to do with the running between the wickets, Sehwag flicks the length ball in the air through the vacant square leg, there is a man already at deep square, something that you expect from the captain when he is defending a small total, just a single
INDIA:2.1  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, pitched up this time around, off stumpish, Sehwag punches it to mid off, does not risk a single
INDIA:1.6  Doeschate to Tendulkar, no run, fuller outside the off stump, driven nicely but straight to the man at cover
INDIA:1.5  Doeschate to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, beautiful! It was not all that fuller, Tendulkar flicks it off his hips behind square leg, the crowds go crazy and Tendulkar is up and running!
INDIA:1.4  Doeschate to Tendulkar, no run, wonderful straight drive from Tendulkar, looked like it would be heading only towards the boundary, but a nice little diving effort from the man at mid on, he moves quickly to his left and dives with arms stretched to save four runs, such fielding efforts would certainly lift any team
INDIA:1.3  Doeschate to Tendulkar, no run, straying on the pads again, Tendulkar gets a slight inside edge onto the pad as he looks to repeat what he did off the first delivery of this over, the bowler was interested initially but the appeal died down pretty quickly
INDIA:1.2  Doeschate to Tendulkar, no run, good comeback from Doeschate, length delivery, Tendulkar pushes it towards mid on
INDIA:1.1  Doeschate to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, poor bowling that, too full and on the leg stump, too easy for someone of the calibre of Tendulkar, moves a touch across and works it behind square on the on side, so both openers off the mark with boundaries for IndiaRyan ten Doeschate, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:0.6  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, good ball to end the over, in the channel just outside the off stump, angled in, Sehwag gets behind and punches it towards mid off
INDIA:0.5  Bukhari to Sehwag, 2 runs, width on offer and Sehwag reaches out to drive that one through the cover region, not much feet movement, the ball goes off the toe of the bat which will only allow him to take two
INDIA:0.4  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, length ball and on the stumps, Sehwag flicks it wide of the man at short mid wicket, didn't hit that with much power, that was the shot that got him out the other day, he has had problems with closing the face of the bat early while looking to play across
INDIA:0.3  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, a touch fuller this time around, Sehwag drives, not well timed though, goes only towards the fielder at mid on
INDIA:0.2  Bukhari to Sehwag, no run, back of a length and around the off stump, Sehwag does well to get behind the line of the delivery, gets on top of the bounce and offers the full face of the bat to block it
INDIA:0.1  Bukhari to Sehwag, FOUR!!, 4 in 4! What a playerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! wonderful start to the innings! The commentators on air were mentioning that Sehwag has started his innings off with a boundary on all three occasions this WC and he does it again, whips the length ball off his pads through square leg, hit that in the gap, off the mark in style!Sehwag and Tendulkar are at the crease. Sehwag is on strike. Bukhari will open the attackWith the kind of batting line up that India has, it should not be much of a problem for them to chase this down. I have been told that this is also the lowest score by a team batting first at Kotla in ODIs. Will Netherlands put up some fight? Will Sehwag and Co. look to finish the game as early as possible? This is Ajith, and I'll be with you for the first 20 overs. The players have walked out, let the game begin.Chawla: The wicket is good to bat on. It is a little bit on the slower side and the boundaries are short. The last two balls spoiled my analysis but I am happy with my effort. I bowled in the right areas. In the last game, I was not getting my rhythm right and I got it today. My focus is to get wickets for the team.Some first time happenings after a long time: 1) Ravi Shastri is not doing commentary for an Indian game after quite a while. Can't remember when was the last time he was absent! 2) India have bowled their overs within the stipulated time and have not exceeded their time-limit. It is a deviation from this World Cup's norm - which has seen sides consistently crossing their limit.Sunil Gavaskar at the pitch report said the wicket is a belter, but it didn't turn out to be that way. It would be harsh to blame the Dutch for the score that they have managed to post, the ball did reverse in the middle overs and the part-timers did a wonderful job before that happened, by stifling the run flow. The Dutch openers did well to get things heading in the right direction, but once they fell, there wasn't any big partnership to bring them back into the game. Yuvraj continued his good run with the ball while Piyush Chawla looked ok for a while and was back to his poor self as Borren took him apart. Bukhari came in and played a very important knock with captain Peter Borren to take them to 189. It looks to be an easy task for the Men in Blue. But, funnier things happen in the game of cricket. Do join us in a short while for the remainder of the game.4

Szwarczynski is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackThe Indian team have a small huddle as MS has a few last minute suggestions to his side. They listen with intent and break away from the huddle. The Dutch openers are out and we are all set to go. Zak has the new nut in the hand. A lone slip in place and it is Viru at that position. It will be Srivathsa, who is starting off the commentary duties.National Anthems' time: Time for the anthems. The Oranje army's is first up. Watching the Dutch anthem suddenly brings back the pleasant memories of last night - when football took centrestage and what a game it was. Barcelona putting on a masterclass against Arsenal at the Nou Camp. Anyway, there is a cricket match to cover and now it is the turn of the Indian national anthem. Everyone in the team are humming to the wonderful tune - which is a great sight to see. Tom Alter - the prominent actor is seen in the crowd and reciting the anthem as well.Zaheer Khan: This is a long tournament, as a team, we have to peak at the right time. Things are looking good for us at the moment. The way the last game went, it was good for us. Our batsmen got some match practice. Our focus is on this game right now, it is good to play back to back matches, and hopefully the game against South Africa will be a good one.Saurabh Somani (after listening to Dhoni's comments at the toss) says: I am short of match practice, haven't played cricket for the last ten years. So, I will qualify to play for the Indian team in the next game.And Vicky64 replies: Short of match practice for 10 years only? The last time I played was in 1987, so I should be captain of that team.Tensach hits back at vicky64: Wrong facts, vicky64 played last year with me, he bowled 1 full over - five full tosses :)Loud cheers for each name as the announcer calls out the names of Indian players. But, big boos when Piyush Chawla's name was called out. The crowd wanted Ashwin to get a game in. Didn't they?Teams:Netherlands (Playing XI): Eric Szwarczynski, Wesley Barresi(w), Tom Cooper, Alexei Kervezee, Ryan ten Doeschate, Bas Zuiderent, Tom de Grooth, Peter Borren(c), Bradley Kruger, Mudassar Bukhari, Pieter SeelaarIndia (Playing XI): Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Piyush Chawla, Zaheer Khan, Ashish NehraNetherlands have won the toss and elected to batDhoni: We would have loved to bat first, considering the track getting lower and slower. We have one change, we have rested Munaf Patel and Nehra is playing. Piyush needs a bit more games than Ashwin, Ashwin is mentally stronger. We felt Piyush needs a bit more bowling practice and that's why we have picked him. Fielding is one area where we want to improve, we need to bowl well in the powerplays and in the death overs.Borren: We would like to bat first. We want to put a target on the board and then put some pressure on India. There is no doubt that we have been a touch disappointing in the last two games, we need to get runs on the board, that would be our main task.The captains are walking out for the toss. The crowd will go crazy if Dhoni wins the toss, but the question is, will he bat first if he gets to make the choice? Or will he do what he did against Ireland?Our own Saurabh Somani who is at the venue writes in: Nehra is warming up along with Zaheer, Bhajji and Yusuf Pathan while the others are just standing and watching them bowl. Will Nehra replace Chawla?Pitch report: Sunil Gavaskar says 'I am here at the National highway 6 at the Feroz Shah Kotla'. This is an absolute belter of a wicket to bat on, there will be lots of runs in store. The wicket is rolled nicely and there will be no doubts whatsoever in the mind of the winning captain. The ball may keep a bit low later on in the game.Ian Chappell had a dig at the chatterbox - Navjot Sidhu - in his Aussie style of sarcasm. He said, 'Nehra is a very bad fielder, far worse than Navjot Singh Sidhu'.A win in today's game will ensure a place in the list of quarter-finalists for India and they would be hoping to get there in style. Netherlands, on the other hand, have had a couple of decent performances, but haven't been able to get a win under their belt. They would hope for ten Doeschate to fire both with the ball and the bat when the two teams face off at the Feroz Shah Kotla in Delhi. What does the pitch have in store for us? Who will win the all important toss? This is Ajith and I will take you through the day along with Ganesh, Sid V and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be back with more updates.Preview by Saurabh SomaniBy this stage in the World Cup, it has been firmly established that no team - whether minnow, established, Associate or full-time - can be taken lightly, and that, especially in Group B, all teams are capable of pulling off wins.
England were given a scare by Netherlands and then beaten by Ireland. However, they in turn beat South Africa, who had looked invincible until their batting meltdown. India have so far been the only team in the group who have not lost a match. Against Netherlands, they would be expected to continue that record, although they will know that it is not likely to be a walk in the park.
India: Although India have remained unbeaten so far, there have been several areas that need improvement. There are times India have looked like the dominant World Cup favourites that they are, but there have also been times when they have struggled. Most noticeable in these has been the bowling and fielding. The contrast between the fielding of India and England was stark, while Ireland's fielding standards were so far above the Indians' that there was no room for any comparison. As MS Dhoni said after the tie against England, there isn't much that can be done about the fielding. The Indian squad is not made up of athletic movers, and that is something they will just have to live with. In the bowling, Piyush Chawla's place will be under the maximum scrutiny after his poor show so far. Depending on the bowling combination India want to go with, either Nehra or R Ashwin should replace Chawla in the starting eleven. The batting may have huffed and puffed a little against Ireland, but the pitch wasn't conducive to extravagant stroke-play and Ireland gave nothing away in the field. Against the Netherlands, this batting line-up will fancy its chances of a big total or a successful chase.
Netherlands: Their performance has been plucky, but too much depends on the extra-ordinary talents of Ryan ten Doeschate. For long recognized as the most talented non-Test playing cricketer, Doeschate's masterful display against England almost pulled off a sensational win for his team. When he failed though - as he did against South Africa and West Indies - his team struggled. Netherlands will look to their batting to help them compete against the home team, since that is their stronger suit. The bowling is a weakness, and they will need something special from their bowlers to contain the Indian batting line-up. Mudassar Bukhari and Pieter Seelar will have to lead the way while bowling, and alongwith Doeschate coming good, Netherlands will look to Tom Cooper to lend solidity to the batting.
Head to Head:
India and Netherlands' only previous meeting was at the 2003 World Cup. India won the match, but it wasn't a walk in the park, with the Dutch bowlers getting their more famous opponents all out for 204 on a pitch that wasn't easy for batting. The Netherlands had then folded for 136, but if they can repeat that kind of bowling performance, they will not be easy pushovers this time.
