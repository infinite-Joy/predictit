SRI LANKA:2.1  Zaheer to Sangakkara, leg byes, 1 run, back of a length and angled in, Sangakkara misses a flick but it goes off the thigh pad to fine leg
SRI LANKA:2.1  Zaheer to Sangakkara, wide, way too wide outside off, Dhoni moves across and collects it
SRI LANKA:1.6  Irfan Pathan to Tharanga, no run, back of a length and just outside off, Tharanga lets it go
SRI LANKA:1.5  Irfan Pathan to Sangakkara, 1 run, good length on the middle and leg, he works it to deep backward square leg for one
SRI LANKA:1.4  Irfan Pathan to Sangakkara, FOUR, almost gone! Risky stroke from Sangakkara and he's almost caught. Irfan Pathan is getting it to swing across rapidly and Sangakkara pokes outside off, it takes the edge and flies just wide of Rohit Sharma at 2nd slip. Good to see the swing back..
SRI LANKA:1.3  Irfan Pathan to Sangakkara, leg byes, 2 runs, another appeal for lbw but that's more in hope more than anything else. Down the leg side and it brushes the pads on the way to fine legKumar Sangakkara, left handed bat, comes to the creaseWell, hawk eye says it would have clipped top of middle and leg. So not a bad decision after all..
SRI LANKA:1.2  Irfan Pathan to Dilshan, out Lbw!! He has given him! That didn't look out initially but let's have a look at the replays. Replays in, and I'm not convinced still. Pitched on length on middle and nipped in, Dilshan was rooted to the crease and hit high on the pads. I think that might have gone over the stumps, Dilshan can't believe it but Irfan Pathan strikes early. Sehwag will be relieved.. Dilshan lbw b Irfan Pathan 6(6) [4s-1] Irfan Pathan to Dilshan, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
SRI LANKA:1.1  Irfan Pathan to Dilshan, 2 runs, gets it to swing in, which is a good sign, but Dilshan manages to flick it to deep square leg for a coupleIrfan Pathan, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attackGood start by Zaheer. He nearly got a wicket too..
SRI LANKA:0.6  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, beaten! Another good delivery from Zaheer - very similar to the first delivery and once again goes past the outside edge
SRI LANKA:0.5  Zaheer to Dilshan, leg byes, 1 run, down the leg side, goes off the pads to the on side
SRI LANKA:0.4  Zaheer to Dilshan, no run, another outswinger outside off but this time he lets it go
SRI LANKA:0.3  Zaheer to Dilshan, no run, catch dropped by Sehwag. The favour is returned. Dilshan dropped Sehwag on 0, Sehwag drops Dilshan on 4. Simplest of chances at 1st slip. Have to feel for Zak - bowled a perfect outswinger and got the outside edge, went at a comfortable height to Sehwag but he miraculously managed to spill it.
SRI LANKA:0.2  Zaheer to Dilshan, FOUR, and it's a perfect start for Dilshan as well. Short and wide delivery, Dilshan stands tall and cuts it between cover and point for a boundary
SRI LANKA:0.2  Zaheer to Tharanga, 2 wides, not so good this time, wayward and down the leg side, Dhoni dives across and makes a half stop
SRI LANKA:0.1  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, good start that for Zaheer! Perfect length and perfect channel just outside off, straightens after pitching and beats Tharanga's pokeTharanga and Dilshan are at the crease. Tharanga is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackThe Sri Lankan openers have come out to the middle. They have a huge task ahead of them as Zaheer starts off proceedings. Apparently, a new hairstyle for Zaheer. A more menacing look for him. 2 slips in place..Sri Lanka were sloppy on the field throughout. They dropped catches, missed a few run out chances and looked tired on the field. They will have to show a lot more energy if they are to chase this down. Join us shortly for the chase..India will be happy with the effort. They're playing after a long break but they didn't look rusty at all. Gambhir fell early but Sehwag and Kohli put on a huge 150+ stand. Sehwag fell short of his century but Kohli carried on and got his 12th ODI ton. Dhoni and Raina provided the perfect finish and took India past the 300 run mark. Of course, it might have been different had Dilshan caught Sehwag when he was on zero...4
INDIA:49.6  Thisara Perera to Irfan Pathan, 1 run, another low full toss, Pathan whips it to deep mid wicket, ends the innings with a single
INDIA:49.5  Thisara Perera to Irfan Pathan, 2 runs, catch dropped and 2 runs added. Poor, poor stuff from Thirimanne. Pathan mishits the lofted shot to long on where Thirimanne drops a sitter. Perera is furious, he isn't happy with that fielding effort
INDIA:49.4  Thisara Perera to Irfan Pathan, FOUR, that spoils the over a bit. A very good shot from Pathan, picks the low full toss and smashes it over mid wicket
INDIA:49.3  Thisara Perera to Irfan Pathan, no run, a bump-ball! A near hat-trick for Perera. A full and straight delivery, Pathan looks to play across and gets it off the toe end of the bat, it hits the ground before lobbing back to the bowler. 3 dot balls..Ravichandran Ashwin, right handed bat, comes to the creaseThey're appealing for a caught and bowled. Was it a bump-ball? The umpires are checking with the TV umpire. Is it another hat-trick for Perera? No. It hit the pitch before it flew to Perera.Perera on a hat-trick. Again..
INDIA:49.2  Thisara Perera to Dhoni, out Caught by Thirimanne!! Another good catch! And suddenly, Perera is on a hat-trick. Full and straight, Dhoni tries the helicopter whip-lash again but doesn't get enough power behind it, Thirimanne at long off misjudges it initially and runs in, but adjusts and takes a good overhead catch. Dhoni c Thirimanne b Thisara Perera 35(29) [4s-3 6s-1] Thisara Perera to Dhoni, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Irfan Pathan, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:49.1  Thisara Perera to Raina, out Caught by (sub)Senanayake!! Good catch that but Raina will be unhappy to miss out on a scoring opportunity. It was a full toss and Raina tried to heave it over the on side, mistimed it completely and hit it high towards mid wicket, 2 fielders converged but Senanayake called early and settled under it. End of a valuable knock from Raina. Raina c (sub)Senanayake b Thisara Perera 50(45) [4s-3 6s-1] Thisara Perera to Raina, THATS OUT!! Caught!!That's Malinga's most expensive spell at home. 83 runs from his 10 overs

INDIA:48.5  Malinga to Dhoni, SIX, not a mishit this time! A clean strike and Malinga's day gets worse. Full and angled in, Dhoni swings across the line and whippily hits it over deep square leg, the ground is big but the shot is even bigger!
INDIA:48.4  Malinga to Dhoni, FOUR, how did he get it there? One hand came off the bat as he played the helicopter whip but he has still managed to collect a boundary. Whips it over mid off who is inside the circle, bounces a couple of times before going past the ropes
INDIA:48.3  Malinga to Raina, 1 run, missed run out! And it nearly injured Raina as well! Amidst all this, Raina has got to his FIFTY. This is what happened: he steered it and got an edge to the keeper, Sanga dived across and stopped it, causing a confusion in the running. Both the batsmen were stranded at the striker's end and Sanga missed a direct hit, Malinga backed up and tried to hit direct at the bowler's end and missed it too. That throw from Malinga almost hit Raina on the way..phew! Would have been dangerous
INDIA:48.2  Malinga to Raina, no run, a yorker length delivery outside off, Raina looks to squeeze it out but can't get bat on ball
INDIA:48.2  Malinga to Dhoni, no ball, 1 run, that's a high full toss! And the umpire rightly calls it a no ball. Dhoni swings across and collects a single to deep square leg

INDIA:46.5  Malinga to Dhoni, FOUR, this time he connects the helicopter well! A low full toss outside off, Dhoni plays the helicopter shot and whips it through mid wicket, it was close to Mahela at that position but he didn't react in time. A touch chance maybe?

INDIA:46.3  Malinga to Dhoni, 1 run, a yorker from Malinga, a helicopter shot from MS Dhoni. Sounds familiar? But just a single to long on this time..
INDIA:46.2  Malinga to Raina, 1 run, very full and just outside off, Raina squeezes it out to third man
INDIA:46.1  Malinga to Raina, SIX, they can get more than 300 if Raina continues to bat like that. That's the first 6 of the match. In the slot for him and he lofts it over long on, 92 meters says the official reading. Big hit indeed.

Good bowling by Perera - he bowls a slow, loopy leg cutter and invites Kohli to go for the big shot, Kohli obliges and tries to drive it over extra cover but doesn't get the elevation. Senanayake is sharp and takes a good overhead catch. Ends a brilliant knock from Kohli - yet another century for him.

INDIA:36.1  Herath to Virat Kohli, no run, a bit of drift into the right hander who gets forward and defends it
INDIA:35.6  Mathews to Raina, 2 runs, mid off is inside the circle and Raina decides to attack. Puts his frontfoot forward and lofts it to long off, didn't get the timing right so he'll get only 2, a good over for India though
INDIA:35.5  Mathews to Raina, no run, Mathews is pleading for an lbw but I guess that pitched outside leg. Mathews can't believe that the decision has gone against him. Raina was stuck in the crease and hit on the backfoot, but can't give them out as it was pitching outside leg
INDIA:35.4  Mathews to Virat Kohli, 1 run, full and straight, Kohli gets a slight leading edge past the bowler to mid off
INDIA:35.3  Mathews to Virat Kohli, FOUR, and this one is the exact opposite of the previous shot. The previous one was a hard hit, this one was a deft touch. Waited for the ball to reach him and then opened the face to steer it to third man, wonderful batting this from Kohli who is into the 90s

INDIA:33.6  Mathews to Rohit Sharma, out Bowled!! Timbah! Rohit Sharma can be a bit lazy at the start of his innings and Mathews has hit the top of off stump with one that nipped in. Rohit was stuck on the crease and a bit late in bringing his bat down and that proved to be his downfall. Angelo is all smiles and Sri Lanka are fighting back.

INDIA:32.5  Herath to Rohit Sharma, no run, played awkwardly to short mid wicket
INDIA:32.4 Herath to Virat Kohli, byes, 1 run, lovely delivery and nearly hit leg stump. The carrom ball flicked from the front of the hand, pitches on off and comes in like a in-swinger, Virat Kohli was off balance as he looked to drive - it went through the bat and pad gap, fooled everyone and went down for a bye
INDIA:32.3  Herath to Virat Kohli, no run, rocks back and hammers it straight to the fielder at cover
INDIA:32.2  Herath to Rohit Sharma, 1 run, Rohit Sharma gets forward and bunts it to long on

INDIA:31.6  Thisara Perera to Virat Kohli, 1 run, drives to long off, and retains strikeSehwag was too slow to turn around and by the time he did, Thisara Perera had already taken aim and hit. Needless wicket to give away at this stage but then with Sehwag it was always on the cards
INDIA:31.5  Thisara Perera to Rohit Sharma, 1 run, Rohit Sharma was a little squared up, but managed to play it with soft hands wide of point to get off the mark

INDIA:31.3  Thisara Perera to Virat Kohli, out Sehwag Run Out!! Expect Sehwag to commit harakiri and he does just that. There was no way he could've got a single as the ball was played to the left of the bowler who turned around and hit direct at Sehwag's end. Sehwag's luck has finally run out and its his own folly that has given Sri Lanka the 2nd wicket. Sehwag run out (Thisara Perera) 96(97) [4s-10] Thisara Perera to Virat Kohli, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Sehwag is run-out!
INDIA:31.2  Thisara Perera to Virat Kohli, FOUR, now that's a bad ball and Virat Kohli is too good a player to let go. Short and wide outside off, Virat cuts hard and over point. Two boundaries in two balls and that prompts Mahela to have a word with Thisara Perera.
INDIA:31.1  Thisara Perera to Virat Kohli, FOUR, that's Virat Kohli at his best. Middle stump length ball - nothing wrong with that - Virat just whips it elegantly wide of long on. Just the uncorking of the wrists at the right moment and the timing did the rest
INDIA:30.6  Herath to Virat Kohli, 1 run, played into the open spaces in the mid wicket area. Virat Kohli retains the strike with that run
INDIA:30.5  Herath to Sehwag, 1 run, cut wide of point, easy single and he gets closer to a century
INDIA:30.4  Herath to Sehwag, no run, that should've been a wide, but Oxenford doesn't seem to agree, going down leg an dlooked like it missed everything on the way

INDIA:29.3  Thisara Perera to Sehwag, 1 run, rises onto his toes and dabs it to third man
INDIA:29.2  Thisara Perera to Sehwag, 2 runs, worst cricket all around. To start off Sehwag played a lazy pull and a lazier effort from Malinga running in from fine leg, allowed the ball to bounce in front of him and conceded an extra run when he should have caught it easily. Well bowled though by Thisara Perera who dug it in short and made Sehwag play a bad shot. Looks like today is Sehwag's day - he gets away again
INDIA:29.1  Thisara Perera to Sehwag, FOUR, lot of room for Sehwag to play his favorite cut shot. Slashed away over point and beat third man comfortably. Moves into the nineties now

INDIA:28.5  Herath to Virat Kohli, 1 run, goes on the backfoot and punches it to long off

INDIA:10.2  Thisara Perera to Sehwag, no run, Kula came charging forward and seemed to have pulled off a blinder at mid off. But the replays proved inconclusive and the BOD went to Sehwag. Tony on air keeps ranting about technology, DRS and the reluctance of Sehwag to walk off. Some things never change! Sehwag had all the right to stand his ground. Meanwhile Mahela wasn't happy with the third umpire's decision and had a lengthy chat with Oxenford. Everything has been sorted out now and we are ready to go again. Drama at HambantotaHas Sehwag holed out? He isn't walking. What a catch by Kula at mid off. Replays show that it may have bounced in front of Kula. Tony Greig on air has already declared it out. But his opinion doesn't matter. What matters is the opinion of the TV umpire who has been called into play. Amidst all this Kula immediately went to ground after catching the ball, he might have pulled his hammy. He was holding his left leg. The TV umpire is taking a lot of looks at the replays which generally means one thing - the BOD will go to Sehwag. Will it be the same this time as well? Not-out is the decision and in the end the right call has been made.

INDIA:8.6  Nuwan Kulasekara to Virat Kohli, FOUR, on the one hand Sehwag is struggling with his timing, here is Virat Kohli who is concentrating on all timing. What an on-drive.

INDIA:8.2  Nuwan Kulasekara to Sehwag, FOUR, not an attractive shot but Sehwag will get a boundary. Clubbed the pull over Nuwan Kulasekara's head even as he was cramped for room. Very straight down the ground and no one is going to stop that

INDIA:5.4  Malinga to Sehwag, no run, that's three times now that Sehwag has missed out on leg stump balls which on any other day would have disappeared to the fence. Malinga appeals more in hope and rightly the appeal is negated
INDIA:5.3  Malinga to Sehwag, no run, bang on middle stump, solidly defended with bat and pad close together
INDIA:5.2  Malinga to Sehwag, FOUR, the weight was on the backfoot and Sehwag just thrashed it through the line - the ball went off the middle of the blade and wide of cover. The rest is history

INDIA:3.5  Malinga to Sehwag, no ball, this will give Sehwag a chance to break the shackles as Malinga oversteps by a couple of inches. Free hit time

INDIA:3.3  Malinga to Sehwag, no run, another mistimed stroke. The bat face turns in the hand and he can only find square leg

INDIA:2.2  Nuwan Kulasekara to Gambhir, out Bowled!! Dilshan will be a happy man. After nearly being run-out last ball, Gambhir falls to the next one. Bowled around his legs. Exposed his leg stump as he tried to flick, it hit the pad and then ricocheted onto the stumps. Not a great delivery, but a wicket is a wicket. A soft one at that and India are 7/1 in the third over. Gambhir b Nuwan Kulasekara 3(6) Nuwan Kulasekara to Gambhir, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:2.1  Nuwan Kulasekara to Sehwag, 1 run, complete chaos between the two and had Dilshan hit from point Gambhir would have been gone. It went off the leading edge to the right of Dilshan who made a diving stop, got up and then threw at the strikers end. Didn't hit and Gambhir survives. If he had gone for the other end, Sehwag wasn't even in the picture.
INDIA:1.6  Malinga to Gambhir, no run, tucked to square leg
INDIA:1.5  Malinga to Gambhir, no run, that's a vicious indipping yorker, Gambhir nearly made the fatal mistake of flicking across the line too early and only a soft leading edge saved him. Malinga has a wry smile on his face

INDIA:1.3  Malinga to Gambhir, 1 run, Gambhir calmly opens the face of the bat and guides it down to third man
INDIA:1.2  Malinga to Sehwag, 1 run, Dropped by Dilshan at point. Lazy stroke from Sehwag and an even more lazier effort from Dilshan. Sehwag threw his bat at a wide one outside off - it was a regulation catch above the head for Dilshan who leapt but it burst through his hands. A very easy catch by Dilshan's standards. Will Sehwag make the Lankans pay?Now a couple of slips with Sehwag on strike. The third man is very square as well
INDIA:1.1  Malinga to Gambhir, 1 run, full pitch outside off, Gambhir digs it out wide of cover and calls Sehwag through who responds. An easy single takenLasith Malinga, right-arm fast, comes into the attackSlight delay as a couple of policemen stroll behind the bowlers arm. Just a single slip in place for Malinga

INDIA:0.4  Nuwan Kulasekara to Sehwag, no run, left alone to a conventional outswinger. That's more sensible from Sehwag
INDIA:0.3  Nuwan Kulasekara to Sehwag, no run, that's a good delivery. Angles it in and it straightens just a bit, leaving Sehwag poking at it. The ball nearly doesn't carry to Sanga. A very nervous start from Sehwag who has now been beaten three balls in a row albeit one off a wide
INDIA:0.3  Nuwan Kulasekara to Sehwag, wide, this one is similar to the previous delivery and the exact sequence of events except that it has been called a wide this time
INDIA:0.2  Nuwan Kulasekara to Sehwag, no run, very loose from Sehwag and nearly a wide as well. Short and wide, going further away, Sehwag flashes without any footwork and nearly paid the priceSehwag v Nuwan Kulasekara now. A couple of slips in place
INDIA:0.1  Nuwan Kulasekara to Gambhir, 1 run, good length on the middle and leg, tucked away to Herath at deep backward square leg. India and Gambhir are awayGambhir and Sehwag are at the crease. Gambhir is on strike. Nuwan Kulasekara will open the attackThe Indian openers walk out. Kulasekara has the new ball. Third man will be waiting in anticipation for a Sehwag upper cut. Will Sehwag fall for the bait again - the short one outside off which has proved to be his bane in recent times. Alright. Here we go.Kohli: The break was good. It was good to get away from the game after a long season. We didn't have the best of tours in England and Australia so the break was much needed. I've been preparing the same way as I did before, so nothing much has changed. I don't like to throw away my wicket - that's something I learnt, batting at the number 3 position. I just go out there and analyse my game according to the wicket and the situation. I don't think about my batting when I'm waiting in the pavilion. I start thinking about it only when I walk in to bat. It is not going to be easy for us, hopefully we can start the series on a winning note.Sangakkara: The form has been good and it's all about adjusting to different formats and oppositions. It has been a great rivalry with India, we have played each other quite often in the last few years and it has always produced good matches. We've got a nice blend of new-comers and experienced players, but it's all about performing on the day. We're very happy to have been playing a lot of cricket in Sri Lanka, it gives us a good foundation for this series. The Indian team will be fresh after the break and they will want to start well. We have to maintain our energies throughout the series.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Rangana HerathIndia (Playing XI): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, MS Dhoni(w/c), Suresh Raina, Irfan Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Zaheer Khan, Pragyan Ojha, Umesh YadavIndia have won the toss and elected to batMahela: It has been a tough season for us but the boys are working really hard. The results have come our way so the boys are confident. We should try and match India in the energy level despite having a busy season so far. The youngsters have played a part in our successes so a lot of things to look forward to in the series. Jeevan Mendis goes out, Herath comes in.Dhoni: I've been practising tosses during the off days so it's good to win a toss! It looks a good pitch, it looks hard but not as hard as the practice wickets that we got. The breeze may be a factor as well. We'll bat first. We want Pathan to play - he will be an all-rounder and both Ojha and Ashwin are playing as well.14:03 We're still waiting for the toss to happen. We'll let you know as and when it happens..Pitch report: The wicket is hard, flat and dry. This wicket is not famous for producing high scoring games but there used to be moisture on this track. Today it is dry and flat and will remain the same throughout. The cross-breeze eases out as the match progresses so that might be a factor.It's India v Sri Lanka time again and the latest instalment is a 5 match ODI series which kicks off today at Hambantota. This match also kickstarts the season for Team India. Sri Lanka are coming off a winning run in the recently held series against Pakistan while India haven't played for quite a while - in fact the last international game they featured in was against Pakistan in the Asia Cup in March. Will India shrug off the rustiness? Or will they be outwitted by a confident Lankan side? The answers in a short while. Do stay tuned for the toss and the teams in a while.Preview by Siddharth PrabhakarIt is that time of the year when India and Sri Lanka meet each other in yet another bilateral series. The frequency with which these two teams have played each other in the past few years would put beach cricket battles between school children to shame, but that hasn't diluted the contests one bit. One would expect a certain feeling of blas? amidst the players while competing against a familiar opposition, but the contests have always been cut-throat. India-Sri Lanka ODIs have single-handedly contributed to the experience of young guns like Virat Kohli, R Ashwin, Angelo Mathews and their ilk. Most of them will be a part of this 5 ODI and 1 match T20I series where new challenges await both sides. India have had a rare 1.5 month break after one of their worst seasons in recent times, while Sri Lanka are in the process of rebuilding and identifying future talent. In short, expect another set of intense and interesting battles between the Asian neighbours. IndiaIndia's showing in the past one year, be it Tests or ODIs, has been discussed to no end. The 8-0 debacle apart, the team did not perform to expectation in recent CB series in Australia and the Asia Cup in Bangladesh. For a team which was supposed to be on a high post the World Cup win, the progress has gone a bit downward. Individually speaking, Virat Kohli has been the standout player in the side which is why his ascent to ODI vice-captaincy did not come as a surprise. MS Dhoni's form as a wicket-keeper/batsman or skipper in the shorter formats has never been questioned, but there is a growing discontentment against him. Gautam Gambhir, after leading his side to the IPL title, has found a new fan following in the general public and media, who want him to be elevated to the post of captain or vice-captain in either of the formats. All this will ensure that the spotlight is keenly focused on these three as far as leadership is concerned. The other batsmen to watch out for will be Rohit Sharma, Manoj Tiwary and Ajinkya Rahane. Sharma and Tiwary got their chances in the A tour to West Indies and did nothing extraordinary to catch everyone's attention. While Sharma's berth in the squad for the T20 World Cup in Septemeber might be booked, it will be a golden opportunity for Tiwary who has gotten the chance thanks to Sachin Tendulkar's absence. Rahane has become the darling of the masses after dream performances in England and the IPL, but with the settled opening pair of Virender Sehwag and Gambhir, it will be doubtful if he gets any chances. India's bowling reserves have come in for a lot of criticism recently. Despite that, there aren't any major changes in the bowling line-up except for the inclusion of Pragyan Ojha as R Ashwin's spin partner. The left-armer from Hyderabad has been impressive in the Tests and with Rahul Sharma failing miserably on the West Indies A tour, the selectors have thrown Ojha back into the mix for the shorter format. Irfan Pathan gets yet another chance and he has said that he is raring to go and 'prove his detractors wrong'. Zaheer Khan and Umesh Yadav have gotten a new ally in Ashok Dinda who might get limited chances as Dhoni might operate with 2 spinners on the slow pitches in Sri Lanka. Sri LankaWhen Sri Lanka lost the finals of the 2011 World Cup, Kumar Sangakkara was the skipper. After that, Tillekaratne Dilshan took over and in the CB series in early 2012, it was Mahela Jayawardene leading the side. The change of leadership itself indicates that it has been a difficult time for Sri Lanka cricket. On top of that, there were contractual problems and board politics distracting the players. Despite that Sri Lanka have remained a strong ODI side and their progress after a year, in comparison to India, has been way better. The biggest improvement for the island nation has been all-rounder Thisara Perera, who has now become a force to reckon with in international cricket. He was the Man of the Series in the 3-1 ODI series win when Pakistan had toured and even impressed in the one Test that he played. Along with Angelo Mathews he has lent strength to the lower middle order as well as contributing majorly with the ball. The other positive for Sri Lanka has been Dilshan's return to characteristic form. Relinquishing the captaincy turned out to be a smart decision indeed. The team looks stable under the able leadership of Mahela, although they should be worried about the lack of fresh talent blossoming through. The skipper, Kumar Sangakkara and Dilshan are still the mainstay of the batting and other than vice-captain Mathews, none of the other batsmen have really made a mark. On the bowling front, Lasith Malinga's presence in the shorter formats always provides a big boost to the confidence of the side. Off spinner Sachitra Senanayake is a good find, while Rangana Herath will lead the spin attack.
