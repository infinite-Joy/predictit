Parthiv Patel is on strike. Rampaul will open the attackRight. We're back. The momentum shifted quite dramatically in the last fifteen overs of the West Indies innings. India need a good start from their openers if they have to chase down this stiff target.This is West Indies' revenge for what India's last wicket pair - Aaron and Umesh Yadav - did with the bat in the last match, says my colleague Srivathsa. Let me remind you once again that they were 149 for 8 in the 31st over, and 170-9 in 36 overs. To bat out 50 overs from that position in itself was some achievement, and to bat the way they did was absolute brilliance. All credit to the man - Rampaul. He came in and started throwing his bat around, and when he sensed that he could stay till the end, became a bit more watchful and started rotating strike. A lot of praise for Roach as well, he stuck around and didn't try anything fancy till the last 2 overs. Also, don't forget what happened earlier in the innings - Umesh Yadav was brilliant with the ball, and Simmons scored yet another half century. India struggled to chase 212 in the last match, how will they do today? Join us at 7 PM to find out.4

WEST INDIES:48.6  Umesh Yadav to Roach, FOUR, shot of the day and it comes from the number 11 batsman! Wait, he doesn't look like a number 11.

This is Sid V to take you through for the first 25 overs.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Lendl Simmons, Adrian Barath, Darren Bravo, Danza Hyatt, Marlon Samuels, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy(c), Ravi Rampaul, Kemar RoachIndia (Playing XI): Virender Sehwag(c), Parthiv Patel(w), Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Vinay Kumar, Varun Aaron, Umesh YadavSammy: We would have bowled first. We have to put up a good score and we back our bowlers to defend anything over 250. This venue reminds me of the Queen's Park Oval in Port of Spain. We have to assess the conditions and put up a good score. Ravi Rampaul replaces Anthony Martin in the team.Sehwag: The wicket will stay the same and the groundstaff are saying that there will be a lot of dew in the night. It is good to see a lot of people cheering our team. We relaxed a bit in the previous match. Rohit and Jadeja played well and we are going with the same side.India have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report: There is a good cloud covering and Sunil Gavaskar reckons that there will be movement in the air for the pace bowlers. There will not be much dew. There are some cracks and they will loosen up as the game progresses. The batsmen will find it hard to score runs later in the day. It is an iffy kind of pitch.The toss will take place at 2:30 PM IST and the match will start at 2:45 PM IST. There will be no reduction in the overs.The drizzle has eased and the covers are slowly coming off. The umpires will come out in a short while and we are expected to have the toss in a very short while.Bad news folks. More covers are coming onto the field. The next inspection will be at 2:30 PM IST.In fact, due to the drizzle, the toss has been delayed. We will give you more updates as they come.There was a slight drizzle early on and the covers were in place. However, it looks like they have been removed. Meanwhile, both teams are continuing their fielding drills.The venue at Vizag has been lucky for India. They have played three matches and won all three of them. They defeated Pakistan in 2005, Sri Lanka in 2007 and Australia in 2010.Welcome to the 2nd ODI between India and the West Indies from Vizag. India just managed to cross the line at Cuttack when they won the match by one wicket. West Indies will be disappointed with their batting performance but they will take a lot of positives from their bowling. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Saurabh SomaniIndia may be leading the series 1-0 at this point, but both teams will go into the second ODI feeling pretty much neck-and-neck, given how close the previous ODI was. West Indies will also remember - as will India - that the Test match immediately preceding the ODIs was thrillingly close. Given that, both teams will go into the second ODI neither feeling over-confident about having a large advantage over the other and neither low on confidence. Also given that both previous close results were arrived at after many batsmen on either side played loose shots, this match could well come down to who makes fewer errors.India: The Indians are not likely to change the combination that won them the first ODI. The track at the ACA Stadium is expected to heavily favour batsmen, with the director of operations at the ground - former India keeper MSK Prasad - saying that there would be little help for slower bowlers and the seamers would have to step up for both teams. In such a scenario, India will stick to the pace trio of Umesh Yadav, Varun Aaron and Vinay Kumar. The batting selects itself, with none of Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Virender Sehwag or Gautam Gambhir droppable, and Ravindra Jadeja providing the all-round option.The only change Sehwag could mull over is one of tactics. Both Umesh Yadav and Varun Aaron consistently hit speeds of above 140 kmph in the first ODI, and throwing the new ball to both of them instead of to Umesh and Vinay Kumar might be a gamble worth taking. Aaron has not had the new ball in both ODIs he has played so far, but it's still a gamble worth taking.West Indies: They will feel good about how they have managed to compete with an on-paper superior Indian team, but they will also be a little hurt at the fact that they couldn't quite finish the job off. Darren Sammy will be justified in demanding more from his batsmen, many of whom perished to bad shots. The only shining exception was Darren Bravo, who enhanced the reputation he had built for himself in the Test series with another fine knock in the first ODI. Each of the other batsmen in the top 7 got to double figures but none could make it count - which is something West Indies will have to correct. The bowlers made them competitive in the first match, but if the batsmen had done their job, the bowlers would have not merely made them compete, but would have won them the match.The only bowler who didn't quite make an impact was spinner Anthony Martin - but then he did castle Man-of-the-Match Rohit Sharma, so he could yet save his spot in the eleven. If he doesn't though, West Indies have the exciting Sunil Narine in their ranks to take up the spinning duties.Forecast:Scattered thunderstorms have been forecast for tomorrow's match, which might cause a few disruptions. The many spectators who will throng the sold-out venue will, of course, be hoping for thunderstorms of a different kind - from the bat of Virender Sehwag.Teams:India (From): Virender Sehwag(c), Parthiv Patel(w), Varun Aaron, Ravichandran Ashwin, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Rahul Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar, Suresh Raina, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay KumarWest Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Adrian Barath(w), Darren Bravo, Kieran Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Marlon Samuels, Danza Hyatt, Anthony Martin, Jason Mohammed, Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Lendl SimmonsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
