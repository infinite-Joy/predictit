We would want to put up a good score. I think, South Africa rely only on one or two batters so we would like to put pressure on them. We are excited as well. Only one change - James Faulkner comes in for Kane Richardson."AB de Villiers: "We will bowl first, because we like to do it. Our team has a nice balance to it and chasing will suit us. It is a tough battle against Australia in the final and we are excited about it. It is more of a mental race. Imran Tahir comes in place of Rilee Rossouw."Pitch Report: "The day is nice and warm and beautifully sunny. This surface has not been used so far in the tournament. It is dry, only a little bit of green. Plenty of cracks too. The wicket will get better as the match goes on," reckons Shaun Pollock.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Phillip Hughes, Aaron Finch, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith, George Bailey(c), Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Nathan LyonSouth Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Aaron Phangiso, Imran TahirSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe news for Australia is that Kane Richardson is not on the ground warming up with the rest of the team. James Faulkner will be playing. Luckily for South Africa, both JP Duminy and Morne Morkel have passed their fitness tests.The track prepared for the final is an entirely new one and is expected to have plenty of carry and bounce. The weather is expected to stay cloudy all throughout the day. With the World Cup merely 5 months away, both teams will be looking forward to exert their dominance over each other. Will South Africa choke as they frequently do? Or will Australia surrender against spin? The answers are just a few minutes away. Hello and welcome to the final of the triangular series between South Africa and Australia. We will bring you the toss and teams shortly. Stay tuned...Meanwhile, by popular vote, Australia are favourites to win this contest. Although they lost their first encounter against South Africa, they came back strongly in the second to achieve a convincing 62-run victory. They definitely have the arsenal to take on any team in the world. Mitchell Marsh, who put up a spectacular all-round display in the last game, would be raring to go. Their bowling department, spear-headed by the intimidating Mitchell Johnson also boasts of the supportive Mitchell Starc and the handy Nathan Lyon. Maxwell can be a useful part-timer as well. They have an intelligent captain in George Bailey, who brings plenty of stability to the side. However, the Australians are not without problems of their own. Kane Richardson is suffering from side soreness and might be replaced by James Faulkner (who has not been impressive of late). Also, their batsmen are surprisingly weak against spin, a factor which the South Africans will readily take advantage of.The Proteas are a strong team. They finished at the top of the table with 14 points, their only defeat coming in their second game against Australia. Their loss was all about crumbling under pressure and choking while chasing, a phenomenon they are already too familiar with. Having said that, one cannot deny that South Africa have a formidable batting line-up. The likes of Quinton de Kock, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers, David Miller are more than capable of churning out big scores. Their main concern, however, will be the bowling attack, which has been left crippled by the absence of Ryan McLaren. To add further to the misery, both Morne Morkel and JP Duminy are not one hundred percent fit for the D-day. While Morkel has a rotator cuff tear, Duminy is troubled with a knee niggle. Their availability will only be clear after a late fitness test. Should neither of them play, South Africa will have to employ the services of Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw (both relatively inexperienced in such situations).When the triangular series began a week ago, it was all supposed to come down to this - a face-off between South Africa and Australia. While that has come true, the passage to the final was not a comfortable one for either of these teams. All thanks to Zimbabwe, who put up a noteworthy display of spin bowling and finally upped the batting performance in their historic win against Australia. The victory offered a very good chance for the hosts to seal a finals spot but South Africa soon made sure they crushed any hopes that Zimbabwe had of coming through.Preview by Bharath RamarajIn what can turn out to be a mouth-watering contest, South Africa, will take on Australia in the final of the tri-series to be played at Harare Sports Club. The two heavyweights of world cricket, between them, won five of their six games during the round robin phase to qualify for the final. The hosts, Zimbabwe, caused an upset by defeating Australia, but weren't consistent enough to qualify for the final.AustraliaAustralia have the necessary firepower in their ranks to overpower any opposition. Aaron Finch, Phil Hughes, Steven Smith/Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin and Glen Maxwell with those bazooka bats can play the big shots.George Bailey, the captain brings solidarity to the batting line-up. However, it has to be said that some of the Australian batsmen especially, Hughes, Finch and Maxwell tend to struggle against spin. Maxwell, known for his power-hitting up against Imran Tahir with his wrong 'un should turn out to be an interesting contest.In the bowling department, Australia depend on pace. Mitchell Johnson, will be relied upon to perform the role of a battering ram. Mitchell Starc is good at generating reverse swing with the old ball. He can also bowl from around the wicket to trouble right-handed batsmen. Kane Richardson though, is reportedly struggling with a side problem. Nathan Lyon is the lone spinner, and will be expected to stem the run flow, and take wickets in the middle overs.South AfricaSouth Africa certainly have the arsenal to match Australia in the final. The formidable trio of Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis can accrue big scores and also twin it by scoring at a good rate. Amla though, hasn't exactly fired on all cylinders in the tournament. Quinton de Kock, the youngster and JP Duminy too can scale great heights with the bat in hand.South Africa though, seem to have a bit more variety in the bowling line-up. Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Kyle Abbott/Wayne Parnell make up for a fine pace attack. However, they also have the option of turning to Tahir or Duminy in the middle overs. South Africa still would miss the services of their unsung hero, Ryan McLaren, who is injured.One factor that has to be always considered when South Africa meet Australia is that we will get to see some world-class fielding.Ground conditionsThe conditions on offer will depend on whether the groundsmen use a new track for the final or not. One expects for a final, the groundsmen to prepare a track with a bit of carry and bounce. Historically, Harare has helped seam bowlers first up, but that hasn't been the case in this tournament.QuotesWe know what they're like and they're pretty structured in their ways. They like to play a certain way and they do it most times. It gets brought up in most meetings that we have, that they have that structure. We're ready to adapt to any conditions and we've done that in the past. We go out there and play our own game: Mitchell JohnsonI've always had things like this as a kid and its one of those things if the physio gives you the all clear you go for it. Ill leave it in his hands, its not really up to me. They'll see how it pulls up and make a decision: Kane Richardson, on his injury.Teams:South Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Aaron Phangiso, Morne Morkel, Kyle Abbott, Mthokozisi Shezi, Imran TahirAustralia (From): Phillip Hughes, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, George Bailey(c), Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Kane Richardson, James Faulkner, Ben CuttingLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
