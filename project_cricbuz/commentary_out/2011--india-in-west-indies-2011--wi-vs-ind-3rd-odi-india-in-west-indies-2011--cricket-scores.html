Praveen Kumar will open the attackPitch report: A bit of grass on the wicket. There are a number of cracks as well. The wicket will be 2 paced and will have a bit of bounce. It will be slow and easier for the batsmen as the game progresses.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Lendl Simmons, Kirk Edwards, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Marlon Samuels, Danza Hyatt, Kieron Pollard, Carlton Baugh(w), Darren Sammy(c), Andre Russell, Kemar Roach, Devendra BishooIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Parthiv Patel(w), Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina(c), Rohit Sharma, Subramaniam Badrinath, Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Praveen Kumar, Amit Mishra, Munaf PatelRaina: The wicket does something initially and gets better as the game goes on. The team remains unchanged. The boys have been doing well in the absence of seniors. Mishra, Praveen and Munaf have been bowling well. We win the series if we win this but we will look to take it as just another game.Sammy: We were in a good position last game but didn't capitalize on the good start. Andre Russel comes in for Martin. Roach is back for Rampaul. Hopefully the pitch will help our type of bowlers.India have won the toss and elected to fieldChris Gayle is still in the sidelines despite West Indies staring at a series loss at the hands of India. West Indies though have brought back Kemar Roach in place of the rested Ravi Rampaul while Dwayne Bravo has been given a break. India might not make many changes to their winning line-up as they would look to seal the series today. Hello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the third ODI between West Indies and India from the Sir Vivian Richards stadium, Antigua. I am Pradeep and I will be joined by Srivathsa, Karthik and Ganesh as we bring you all the action. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates.The preview by Ganesh ChandrasekaranWest Indies aim to stop the Indian juggernaut from running away with the series as both teams head into the third ODI with India sitting pretty 2-0 up. The tour rolls into Antigua for the next two games and Windies selectors seem to be happy to stick to their rotation policy. Chris Gayle is, surprisingly, still out of favour while Dwayne Bravo and Ravi Rampaul have been rested for the next two games. Danza Hyatt and Kemar Roach make a return to the national team.Can WI break the jinx?West Indies have more problems apart from the selection issues, they are yet to taste success at the Sir Vivian Richards stadium in Antigua and the odds are stacked against them while they try to set that record straight and make a comeback in the series.Time for the batsmen to step it upDarren Sammy has conceded that their problems lie in the inconsistent batting and Sarwan has gone on record to say that the team was missing the presence of the mercurial Gayle. Lendl Simmons has gone past fifty five times this year but has not been able to convert even one of them into a ton. Being an opener it is imperative for him to go on and make a big score after getting a start. The middle order comprises of the experienced Ramnaresh Sarwan and the immensely talented Marlon Samuels but both have flattered to deceive. Sarwan may have fifties in both games but he has struggled to stamp his authority as he once did.No room for complacencyThe players' primary battle will be the one happening inside their head - many a time have we seen the Indian team losing focus after a good start and it is easier for a successful young team to drift a bit. Suresh Raina has been an able leader in the absence of the seniors and he along with Duncan Fletcher will be doing their best to keep the young turks on their toes. This is an ideal time for the young lot to make their presence felt at the international stage and the series itself has showed us the quality of the Indian bench strength. The likes of Badrinath, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan have grabbed their opportunities and will be looking to strengthen their case further.Quotes:The young Indians players want to handle pressure. We want to improve in every game. Take as much responsibility as we can. We want to make use of every opportunity - Virat Kohli after India won the second ODI.We can't fault the effort of the bowlers, they've been doing their job. Hopefully, in Antigua, we'll have a better surface for us to play our style of cricket - Darren Sammy looks for improvement after a disappointing loss.Teams:West Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Devendra Bishoo, Darren Bravo, Andre Fletcher, Danza Hyatt, Andre Russell, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Carlton Baugh(w), Anthony Martin, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Kirk Edwards, Kieron Pollard, Kemar RoachIndia (From): Suresh Raina(c), Harbhajan Singh, Ravichandran Ashwin, Subramaniam Badrinath, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Praveen Kumar, Amit Mishra, Munaf Patel, Parthiv Patel(w), Yusuf Pathan, Wriddhiman Saha, Ishant Sharma, Rohit Sharma, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay KumarLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
