Naveed will open the attackWelcome back. William Porterfield and Paul Stirling have walked out to the middle. Mohammad Naveed will open the attack for UAE. Two slips in place for him...Anwar: "It's a good total for the team and I wanted to put maximum runs on the board. I am really happy. We can now put pressure on the opposition and we will try to win the match. I was always comfortable at the crease, I trust myself. It's a big game. I think it's my best knock."Ireland then managed to pull things back a bit in the final overs. Stirling was the pick of the bowlers, registering figures of 2/27 in his 10 overs. Sorensen, Cusack and Kevin O'Brien picked up two as well but they were expensive. Overall a decent effort from UAE but Ireland have the batting fire-power to chase this down. Join us back in a few minutes for the run chase....Veteran Khurram Khan stabilized the innings in the middle overs along with Shaiman Anwar but Khan was not able to hang in for long. Shaiman Anwar continued and combined well with Amjad Javed to lift UAE from the slump. The duo accelerated in the batting powerplay and hit the bowlers all over the park. Javed was unfortunate to fall on 42, but not before the duo had put up the highest 7th-wicket stand in the history of the tournament. Anwar then went on to score his maiden ODI hundred and also became the first UAE batsman to register a ton in World Cups.UAE will be pleased to finish on 278/9 after surviving a bit of a wobble. After being put into bat, they started off steadily moving at a decent pace. However, a change in bowling from Ireland turned things around, with Stirling picking up Berenger and Karate in back-to-back overs. Soon after, Kevin O'Brien picked up two wickets in his two overs, reducing UAE to 78 for four.4

Very exciting to play at the Gabba. It was a good game of cricket against Zimbabwe. Looking forward to this game as well. Even a score of 350-360 is chased down nowadays. We need to bowl well and field well to restrict that. We wanted to bat first as well. It is a good toss to lose. Just put runs on the board and put them under pressure. It is a great event, mega exposure to all the guys. We need to play good and positive cricket. As I said, put runs on the board and put them under pressure."William Porterfield: "It was a very good win against West Indies. We had a lot of time to rest and get ready for this game. It doesn't count for anything unless you back it up. I think the long wait hasn't been too bad. Got a couple of days to relax and build up again for this game. We will bowl first. It is going to be a belter of a pitch today. We will make use of the swing, it is a bit humid. We want to go out there and do what we got to do. We want to put a big performance. We want to take each day as it comes."Pitch Report: "The pitch is a little bit thirsty after that washed out game between Australia and Bangladesh. There is not too much of a live grass. There is a little bit of cracking, but I don't think that will come into play much. The average score batting first in the last 5 games here is 250. If you can bat first, it can be 300 day," reckon Damien Fleming and Dean Jones.Both teams are expected to field the same sides, but we will only know for sure after the toss. Stay tuned.Ireland are the favourites here, especially after the dominating performance they put against the West Indies, who have since then won both their games. But, take UAE lightly at your own peril, they did put up a good show against Zimbabwe. Both teams are going to face each other for the first time in an ODI World Cup game. West Indies and Pakistan would also have great interest in this contest. A win for Ireland today would make it tough for both teams to progress to the quarterfinals.Weather update: Brisbane has been bright and sunny for the past few days, but today it's going to be a little cloudy. Some rain is expected during the final hours of the day, but hopefully, we will get a full game in. The maximum temperature is expected to be around 28 degree Celsius.IrelandIreland were magnificent in their first game. After West Indies posted a total above 300 against them, their batters came to the party and thrashed the West Indian bowlers all over the park. The Irish batsmen never looked in any sort of trouble against their Caribbean counterparts. Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce and Niall O'Brien all notched up fluent 70+ scores to help their team win. Even though Ireland lost 4 wickets for 18 runs during the final stages of their innings, Niall O'Brien stayed till the end to see his team through with 25 balls to spare.UAEThe team from the Middle East has only played one game so far and it was a closely fought contest between them and Zimbabwe. After being put into bat, UAE braved through the initial hiccups and went onto post 285/7 in their 50 overs. The star of their batting was Shaiman Anwar, who made a 50-ball 67 and it was his acceleration that helped his team reach the 285 mark. Their bowlers didn't start off well, but came back strongly in the middle overs to reduce Zimbabwe to 167/5 in the 33rd over. But, a 83-run partnership in quick time between Sean Williams and Craig Ervine, helped Zimbabwe beat UAE by 4 wickets in the end.Before we go forward, let's take a look at the form of both the teams:12:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: Yesterday, we witnessed the Gaylestorm's firepower as Chris Gayle notched up the first ODI double ton by a non-Indian batsman. He wreaked havoc on the Zimbabwean bowlers at the Manuka Oval. Today the World Cup party moves to the city of Brisbane. A few days ago, the Australia vs Bangladesh game was washed out due to Cyclone Marcia and torrential rains that followed the cyclone. Today, we are expecting to get a full game in at the Gabba. It promises to be an interesting game, with two associates, Ireland and UAE pitted against each other.PreviewIreland have a golden opportunity to strengthen their case for the knockouts when they play fellow Associates United Arab Emirates in a Pool B encounter at Brisbane in the ICC World Cup on Wednesday.The Irish's shock win against West Indies in their opener has given the group a big twist. India, Pakistan, South Africa and West Indies - due to their immense experience at the international level - were the pre-tournament favourites to advance from the group but the way Ireland chased down 305 - with 25 balls remaining and four wickets in hand - against the Caribbean team, the fourth spot in the group is not certain to go to a Test team anymore.While both Ireland and UAE are Associate nations, the chasm between their cricket standards is very big. Ireland are considered to be the best Associate nation by many, and there is big support for them in their bid for the Test status.UAE, on the other hand, impressed against Zimbabwe in their opener, even though they ended up on the losing side. After making a competitive 285, they made their opponents' life difficult and if it weren't for a sixth-wicket 83-run stand between Sean Williams and Craig Ervine, they result might have been different.Venue: The Gabba, BrisbaneStart: 9 am ISTWeather: Brisbane saw a washout without a ball being bowled between Australia and Bangladesh on February 21, but there has been good sunshine over the last few days. However, it's been predicted to be not so sunny tomorrow with the temperatures expected to hover between 20 and 30 degrees Celcius.Team News:IrelandThe possibility of Ireland changing their winning composition is very slim. In case of injuries, Alex Cusack and Craig Young, left out against West Indies, might be called upon.Probable XI: 1 William Porterfield (capt), 2 Paul Stirling, 3 Ed Joyce, 4 Niall O'Brien, 5 Gary Wilson (wk), 6 Andy Balbirnie, 7 Kevin O'Brien, 8 John Mooney, 9 George Dockrell, 10 Max Sorensen, 11 Andy McBrineUAEThey too are unlikely to make any changes. Captain Mohammad Tauqir would like to keep the same XI that gave Zimbabwe a good run for their money.Probable XI:1 Amjad Ali, 2 Andri Berenger, 3 Krishna Chandran, 4 Khurram Khan, 5 Swapnil Patil (wk), 6 Shaiman Anwar, 7 Rohan Mustafa, 8 Mohammad Naveed, 9 Amjad Javed, 10 Mohammad Tauqir (capt), 11 Nasir AzizPlayers to watch out for:Shaiman Anwar's 67 off 50 balls at No 6 against Zimbabwe was the reason why UAE reached a fighting total. Expect another cracker from him.For Ireland, it has to Ed Joyce. The left-hander's 84 went a long way towards getting the team over the line against West Indies. He must be eyeing another significant innings.Quotes:The squad are great. All the lads are firing. We have a full 15 to pick from again and it will be tough to pick the starting team. Four lads will miss out. We know that whatever eleven go out onto the park we know they will give it all and the lads on the sidelines will back them up. You need competition to keep everybody fresh and on their toes. That's the way it should be and will be for the next six weeks: Porterfield, when asked whether he was considering any changesThey'll be targeting us. We've played lots of games against them. I think it's a wonderful opportunity because it's a very important game for us as well. So we're definitely targeting this game: Khurram, when asked about his team's approach for the gameStats:1. Porterfield needs just 18 runs to overtake Kevin O'Brien as the leading ODI run-getter for the Irish team.2. The Irish beat UAE in the T20 World Cup last year in Bangladesh. However, in the 50-over World Cup, both are playing each other for the first time.Teams:United Arab Emirates (From): Amjad Ali, Andri Berenger, Krishnachandran Karate, Khurram Khan, Swapnil Patil(w), Shaiman Anwar, Rohan Mustafa, Amjad Javed, Mohammad Naveed, Mohammad Tauqir(c), Nasir Aziz, Manjula Guruge, Fahad Alhashmi, Kamran Shazad, Saqlain HaiderIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, Max Sorensen, George Dockrell, Andy McBrine, Peter Chase, Alex Cusack, Stuart Thompson, Craig YoungLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
