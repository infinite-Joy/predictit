This will need final confirmation. This is how it looks as at now.'Roshan Abeysinghe tweets: 'The cut off time is 11.15. And if a 20 over has to be played it has to start at around 9.45. The clearing takes 45 mts which means 9 pm.'7:40 local: It is still drizzling out there and looks like it may take a while before we get any play.Mahela isn't happy with the slippery conditions and the drizzle has gotten heavier which ensures the covers are on.

The lights are on as the sun sets slowly at Hambantota. We are all set for some actionRevised playing conditions: Match has been reduced to 42 overs a side. The powerplay will be for 9 overs and 4 overs of batting powerplay. Two can bowl 9 and three can bowl 8 overs.4:20 local: Roshan Abeysinghe has tweeted that there is an inspection scheduled in 10 minutes.3:35 local: Great news - the rain has stopped and the main cover has come off now.3:15 local: It looks to have brightened up in the middle. Rain seems to have stopped for the moment.2:40 local: The news isn't any better from Hambantota - it is still drizzling and it looks like a test of patience for everyone.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Mahela Jayawardene(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith MalingaNew Zealand (Playing XI): Rob Nicol, BJ Watling(w), Brendon McCullum, Ross Taylor(c), Kane Williamson, James Franklin, Andrew Ellis, Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Trent BoultTaylor: 'Obviously we would have liked to bowl first, but we need to get a good start. Hope the weather can stay away and would like to post a competitive total. Ellis comes in for Oram and Adam Milne makes his ODI debut, replacing Kyle Mills. Watling has been very good at the top and hope he can continue in the same vein.'Mahela: 'Looks a good wicket to bat, but the weather looks very scary and we would look to bowl first and capitalise. We have done it pretty well [chasing] in the last two games and we would look to continue that. Chandimal comes in for Dilshan.'Pitch report: Craig McMillan says that he heard some of the loudest thunder and plenty of rain last night. There are very dark patches which suggests that there is a fair bit of moisture. McMillan reckons that the surface will help the new ball bowlers and batting won't be easy. The captain winning the toss would like to bowl first.Live visuals from the ground show the covers are on and the skies look very dark. Not good signs, hopefully we will get some action.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to fieldA warm welcome to the fourth ODI between Sri Lanka and New Zealand from Hambantota. Sri Lanka lead the series 2-0 and would be looking to finish it off today so that they can give the fringe players a go in the final ODI. Dilshan who made a wonderful unbeaten 102 in the last game is injured and will miss the rest of the series. Will that be a big blow to Sri Lanka? We'll know pretty soon. Do stay tuned for the toss and the teams in a bit.PreviewNew Zealand will hope the weather doesn't play a part again and that they get back to winnings ways when they take on Sri Lanka in the 4th ODI at Hambantota. The visitors will hope that the change in venue will bring them some much needed luck as they face 2-0 deficit against the hosts. For Sri Lanka, it will be a matter of carrying forward their good run and they will want to seal the series and assert their dominance. New Zealand: The visitors have had some good performances coming into the make-or-break game. BJ Watling, Rob Nicol and Ross Taylor have had some good outings with the bat and will be confident of carrying on while James Franklin and Nathan McCullum's form lower down too will give them hope of performing well with the bat. Their main worry would be their display with the ball. Kyle Mills has led the attack admirably, but without the experience of the wily Daniel Vettori to fall back on, the bowlers have been unable to cut down on the SL scoring. Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka were dealt a big blow when the in-form Tillakaratne Dilshan was ruled out of the next two matches, but their batting still holds a lot of potential with the likes of Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews among others. Sangakkara's form so far would be a cause for concern, and with Dilshan missing out SL will hope for the stylish left-hander to come good. On the bowling front, Lasith Malinga has been performing well and has been ably supported by the likes of Jeevan Mendis and Rangana Herath. Mathews too has been hard to get away with his slower ones. Final word:Sri Lanka will go into the game as favourites, but the 2-0 scoreline only exaggerates the hosts' dominance in this series. New Zealand have been performing well and will be confident of pulling one back.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Dinesh Chandimal, Akila Dananjaya Perera, Shaminda Eranga, Tharindu KaushalNew Zealand (From): Rob Nicol, BJ Watling, Brendon McCullum(w), Ross Taylor(c), Jacob Oram, James Franklin, Kane Williamson, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Andrew Ellis, Ronnie Hira, Tom Latham, Adam MilneLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
