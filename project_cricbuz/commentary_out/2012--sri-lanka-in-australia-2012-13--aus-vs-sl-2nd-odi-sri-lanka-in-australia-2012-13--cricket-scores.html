Toss in a few moments.Hello and welcome to the coverage of the 2nd ODI between Australia and Sri Lanka. The hosts have dominated the emerald island throughout the Test series and in the first ODI, despite fielding just non-regulars in the latter. The World Cup runners-up are a strong side and they will come hard at the Aussies today. Stay tuned for the toss.Preview by Gokul GopalHaving silenced the critics - who labelled them as a second-string side - with a big win against Sri Lanka in the opening ODI, Australia will be looking to extend their domination as they head to Adelaide for the second match. The visitors, on the other hand, have their work cut-out as they look to prevent the hosts from taking a further lead in the series.Australia:Despite the absence of Michael Clarke, Shane Watson, David Warner and Matthew Wade, the ODI outfit, led by George Bailey, got off to a tremendous start with a thumping 107-run victory in the first of the five One dayers against Sri Lanka. Phil Hughes made most of the opportunity with a well-compiled century in his debut ODI. Stand-in skipper Bailey too came good with the bat at Melbourne, providing the fire-power. With the Australian selectors deciding not to include Michael Hussey in the ODI scheme of things, David Hussey was the key man in the Australian middle order and he showed why with a splendid knock that powered Australia to a score in excess of 300 at the MCG. Bailey will be hoping for a similar effort from his batsmen and will be expecting the ones who failed in the opening game - Aaron Finch, Usman Khwaja and Glenn Maxwell - to come good with the bat. With some of the senior members expected to return for the third ODI, this game may be the only chance for the likes of Khwaja and Finch to showcase their prowess.The Australian bowlers did not have to work too hard for the wickets in the opening game, with most of the Sri Lankans remaining as edgy as they were during the Test series. To add to that, there were three run-outs which made things even easier for the hosts. Clint McKay bowled good lines and picked up a four wicket haul in that game while Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc too stuck to their tasks. The spinners were not as effective though as the likes of Xavier Doherty, Maxwell and Dave Hussey, went for a few runs. While the pacers are expected to do their jobs as well as they have been doing so far, Australia will be hoping for the spinners to lend some assistance.Team News: Mitchell Starc will not be part of the Australian team for the remainder of the ODI series after picking up a soreness in his calf muscle. While Kane Richardson has been brought in as stand-by, Ben Cutting is in line for an ODI debut at Adelaide.Sri LankaThe visitors were utterly disappointing in the just concluded Test series that Australia won 3-0, and their lack-lustre display has continued into the limited overs game with the Lankans showing no signs of improvement whatsoever. One of the main reasons for their failure is the performance of the batsmen. While Upul Tharanga and Mahela Jayawardene fell after they pushed at deliveries out-side off, what was even more appalling was the running between the wickets and poor judgement shown by the Sri Lankan batsmen, which resulted in three run outs. While Dinesh Chandimal's sturdy presence and Dilshan scoring a half-century might be positive signs for the visiting team, the lack of intent on the part of the other batsmen, is something that skipper Jayawardene will be very worried about. He will be demanding better application from the batters, including himself, failing which, Sri Lanka's tour of Down Under will only go further down and under.Despite the presence of Lasith Malinga and Ajantha Mendis, the Lankan bowling department failed to make any sort of impact. Barring Dilshan, who bowled four tight overs, all the other bowlers had economy rates on the high. Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Jeevan Mendis and Thisara Perera, gave away quite a lot of runs - 194 runs came off 28 overs bowled collectively by these four. Kulasekara and Mathews did not concede as much, but they too lacked the sting. The bowlers need to step up quite a few notches and the batsmen also need to give something for their bowlers if Sri Lanka stand any chance of levelling the series.Team News: Sri Lanka's main concern will be that their in-form batsman Chandimal has injured his hamstring and the status of his availability for the 2nd ODI is still not known. Sri Lanka may hand a debut for Kushal Perera in case Chandimal is ruled out. With both Ajantha and Jeevan Mendis conceding quite a lot of runs, Sri Lanka might also think of bringing in Rangana Herath.Upcoming milestones:151: The number of runs Mahela Jayawardene requires to cross the mark of 11,000 runs in ODIs.6: Mahela Jayawardene needs to take 6 more catches to become the only player in ODIs with 200 catches.95: Tillakaratne Dilshan needs 95 more runs to become the seventh Sri Lankan with 7000 or more runs in ODIs.Quotes:It was a really great team effort to stand up on the back of some criticism from outsiders and some people who weren't sure if we were up to it: George Bailey reacting to comments of the current Australian squad being called a B-team.When you're chasing a score like that, you just can't have the guts of your batting taken out through run outs: Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford wants the Lankan batsmen to show better judgement while running between the wickets.Teams:Australia (From): George Bailey(c), Ben Cutting, Xavier Doherty, Aaron Finch, Brad Haddin(w), David Hussey, Clint McKay, Steve Smith, Phillip Hughes, Mitchell Johnson, Usman Khawaja, Glenn Maxwell, Kane RichardsonSri Lanka (From): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Dinesh Chandimal(w), Shaminda Eranga, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Kulasekara, Angelo Mathews, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Akila Dananjaya Perera, Upul Tharanga, Kushal Janith Perera, Ajantha MendisLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
