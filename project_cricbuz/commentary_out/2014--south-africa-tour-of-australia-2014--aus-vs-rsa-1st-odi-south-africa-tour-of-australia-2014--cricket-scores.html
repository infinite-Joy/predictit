Unfortunately, I have tweaked my hamstring. I will have a scan tomorrow. It's certainly something not nice. At the end of the day, I will have to wait for the scan. I set off for a run and hurt my hamstring. There is not much more I can tell you at this stage. Fortunately, I was running with Watto, who is not quick as well. The fact is I have had the injury for the third time in the past six weeks on the same leg . That is not positive. I will be in good hands and listen to the experts and doctors. That's unbelievable and he thoroughly deserves it (referring to Johnson winning the ICC Player of the Year award). For him to turn things around, he is magnificent. He deserves all the credit. He has worked exceptionally hard. When we have Mitchell Johnson fit and firing we are a different team. We are in for a great summer. I hope I can be a part of it. I would have loved to be out there fielding right now. I have good people looking after me. The public should be excited about the opposition coming and the Australian team. I like to get both these guys out. They are a class team."Meanwhile, he's what Michael Clarke said a few minutes ago.Drinks are on the field now

Toss, teams and all the action to follow shortly.If you are looking for battles within the war, don't miss Johnson vs Steyn on what is expected to be a spicy Perth wicket! Also with the World Cup 92 days away, both sides will be eager to revv up their preparations and figure out the ideal combination for the marquee tournament.Hello and welcome to the first of the five-match ODI series between Australia and South Africa. The hosts, who clinched the T20I series, will be strengthened by the return of David Warner, George Bailey, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke and Mitch Johnson. Bar the injured JPD, South Africa also have a full strength team at their disposal with the likes of Steyn, Amla, AB and Faf coming back.PreviewLethal fast bowlers Mitchell Johnson and Dale Steyn will spearhead the attacks as Australia and South Africa renew hostilities in a five-match one-day series opening in Perth on Friday.Johnson and Steyn are world cricket's most lethal speedsters and will look to create mayhem on an expected lively WACA pitch in the first of two ODIs in the Western Australia capital. No love is lost between the two cricket nations who are just shaded in the ODI rankings by India, with South Africa ahead of Australia by a single ranking point.The series comes just three months before the ICC Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand with the Proteas looking for another psychological edge over the Australians after beating them twice in Zimbabwe in August-September."There's always tension between the two sides," Johnson said. "It's probably going to be fiery again. There's a lot of history there. Both teams don't like to lose and you see that fire in the belly. A lot of the guys will talk after the game... but I think hate is too strong a word."Johnson showed his menacing streak ahead of Friday's first ODI when he struck team-mate Steve Smith a painful blow on a finger in the nets. Johnson is in line for a rare double as cricketer of the year after a shortlist of nominees was announced by the ICC last week. During the voting period of August 26, 2013 and September 17, 2014, the 2009 winner Johnson claimed 59 wickets in eight Tests at an impressive average of 15.23.South Africa's Dale Steyn bowls during an ODI match against New Zealand, at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, on October 21, 2014 ? AFPSteyn was formidable in his last tilt at the Australians, taking four for 34 with Proteas skipper AB de Villiers describing him as "the best bowler of reverse swing in the world by a long way". While Steyn is the tourists' key attack, Faf Du Plessis has an outstanding record with the bat against Australia with scores of 106, 126 and 96 during South Africa's recent triangular series win in Zimbabwe.Du Plessis, 30, realises that to continue his stunning form he'll have to do it with a target on his back."You can see they've got plans when you come out to bat, where they try to get you out. But in the same way, I plan for what they plan. So it's just trying to be smart and thinking on your feet," du Plessis said.Coach Russell Domingo, who has overseen South Africa winning 10 of their last 11 ODIs, is preparing for a feisty series."We expect the Australians to play a hard brand of cricket, that?s the way they play their cricket and it's not something we are too concerned about. We want to focus on how we carry ourselves and how we conduct ourselves on the field; we will try and do that in the best way possible," Domingo said.Australia skipper Michael Clarke heads into the series averaging just 14.25 during the recent two-Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, leading some to question his captaincy. But team-mate George Bailey said it is wrong to criticise Clarke given his strong overall record as a captain, which includes a 5-0 Ashes win over England and a Test series victory away to South Africa."If you look at his record it speaks for itself," Bailey said. "It's obviously a position people care a lot about. The Australian cricket team means a lot to a lot of people. But I'll back Pup (Clarke) to the hilt in terms of his performance and what he's done."After the two ODIs in Perth, the series heads to Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Rilee Rossouw, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Kyle Abbott, Wayne Parnell, Robin PetersonAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Josh Hazlewood, Kane Richardson, Steven SmithLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
