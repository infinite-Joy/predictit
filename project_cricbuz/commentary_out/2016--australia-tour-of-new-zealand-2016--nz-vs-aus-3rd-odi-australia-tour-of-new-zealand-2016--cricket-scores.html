AUSTRALIA:43.4 43.4Milne to Boland, out Boland Run Out!! Here it is. Thousands of people and the eleven on the field celebrate McCullum's farewell as a direct hit has found Boland short at the bowler's end. Slower delivery dragged down, Boland chopped it to backward point and tried to sneak in a single. Took on Nicholls who overwhelms with his spearing throw and finds Boland short. McCullum lets out a roar, runs in with his finger pointing to the heavens and forms the seed for that celebratory huddle. New Zealand retain the Chappell-Hadlee trophy with a 2-1 win. Boland run out (Henry Nicholls) 2(12)Milne to Boland, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!

AUSTRALIA:43.2 Milne to Boland, no run, ooh! How has that missed? That was as close to me clearing the GREs. Dipping slower delivery just outside off, Boland misses the jam out and it rolls past the off-stump. Just past it, just
AUSTRALIA:43.1 Milne to Boland, no run, gets his head low from the head-ripping zone and evades this short "dream farewell for BMac" bumper
AUSTRALIA:42.6 Corey Anderson to Hazlewood, no run, back-away, swing and miss. Play that record when you miss McCullum. Makes room with a slide outside his leg-stump, throws his bat at the upper cut and ends up swishing the thin air
AUSTRALIA:42.5 Corey Anderson to Boland, 1 run, opens the face of the bat but couldn't middle the steer. Off the outside edge and it scoots along the ground to third man
AUSTRALIA:42.4 Corey Anderson to Boland, no run, and he connects. Stop the press, please. Gets the width and the height, and flashes the ball to backward point
AUSTRALIA:42.3 Corey Anderson to Boland, no run, and another one. That's the order of the hour. Seems like the ball's a stalker and the bat's a stalkee. Goes for the steer to third man and sees the ball graze past his bat

AUSTRALIA:40.5 Corey Anderson to Zampa, out Caught by Brendon McCullum!! It pays to invest in your LIC premiums, it pays to study before your end terms and it pays to have a slip. Only McCullum. He was befuddled all this over and threw his bat at this length delivery and edged it behind. McCullum pulled off another beauty, as if the brainchild of having the slip wasn't enough. Dives in front of him and pouches this dying ball in front of him at first slip. Oh McCullum! Why McCullum? Zampa c Brendon McCullum b Corey Anderson 2(11)Corey Anderson to Zampa, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:40.4 Corey Anderson to Zampa, no run, the ugly swat. Widens his stance and looks to flog this lengh ball across the line. No where close

AUSTRALIA:39.6 Milne to Wade, out Caught by Guptill!! Straight to Guptill at mid-wicket! Oh my. Talk about placing it well. Slower bouncer it was, Wade swiveled to pull but couldn't time it as the ball hugged the pitch and ballooned up slowly.

AUSTRALIA:38.1 Corey Anderson to Hastings, out Caught by Elliott!! This wicket is as much Milne's as it's Anderson's. Only if the scorecards were more than just being a meter wide and an inch deep. Short ball outside off, Hastings fetches it with a swiveling pull, gets it high on the bat with his confidence shattered in the previous over by Milne. Gets it high on the bat and Elliott squats at deep mid-wicket to snaffle this. Hastings c Elliott b Corey Anderson 6(19)Corey Anderson to Hastings, THAT'S OUT!!

AUSTRALIA:33.4 Matt Henry to Mitchell Marsh, out Caught&Bowled!! Marsh is not a happy man. Lets McCullum know about his feelings. It was a very late appeal from the Black Caps. Maybe they saw it on the giantscreen and then went up. That is what is frustrating the Aussies. It was a yorker length delivery around off, Marsh jams it off the toe-end onto the boot, the ball carries to Henry, who collects it and appeals gently. Ian Gould sends it upstairs and after a number of replays, TV umpire Ravi gives the marching orders for Marsh. Might be the turning point in the game. Don't be surprised if there is plenty said about this dismissal post-match. Mitchell Marsh c and b Matt Henry 41(42) [4s-4 6s-1]Matt Henry to Mitchell Marsh, THAT'S OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!Henry thought about appealing for caught and bowled. That looks very close. The umpire has gone upstairs. Or has he? Gould is conversing with McCullum. It is going be umpire referral. The Kiwis are not interested by the looks of it. The crowd are excited. Yes, it has been sent upstairs. Smith doesn't look happy in the dressing room. It is a fair delivery. The ball has gone straight onto the boot. Different angles being replayed to the TV umpire. The Zoomer is in. It's OUT says umpire Ravi.

New Zealand have done well to pull things back post Khawaja's departure. The Aussies were off to a flier of a much lesser intensity than their counterparts. But both openers have now been removed and it gives the hosts a look into this middle order. Still, pretty much Australia's game to lose.

AUSTRALIA:15.3 Doug Bracewell to Bailey, no run, length ball on off, defended after moving inches forward

AUSTRALIA:15.1 Doug Bracewell to Bailey, no run, climbing nicely from a short of length and hitting Bailey's bat hard as he employs a back foot defenceClouds are gathering overhead. Dark ones.

AUSTRALIA:11.2 Doug Bracewell to Khawaja, out Caught by Ronchi!! His exuberance gets the better of him. So often happens to players with plenty of shots in their quiver, just can't refrain from exhibiting them. This time Khawaja is tempted into driving a ball which cannot be termed "full" by any means. As a result, he can't get on top of the bounce of it while playing away from the body. Ends up nicking it to Ronchi's left who moves across smartly and pouches. Khawaja c Ronchi b Doug Bracewell 44(36) [4s-4 6s-2]Doug Bracewell to Khawaja, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

AUSTRALIA:10.4 Matt Henry to Khawaja, FOUR, just grunts a loud "no" in anguish and turns back rather than watching a gutter ball being whipped away fine. That's what I would do too

AUSTRALIA:8.1 Matt Henry to Smith, no run, length ball just outside off, punched to mid-off

AUSTRALIA:7.5 Milne to Khawaja, SIX, excellent short ball which goes soaring over fine leg off a thick top edge. Moral win for the bowler but unfortunately there is no place for it on the scorebook.

AUSTRALIA:4.6 Matt Henry to Warner, out Caught by Elliott!! He's chipped one straight to cover. What was Warner trying to do there? Such a half-hearted shot. Banged in on a short of length just outside off, might have held up on him slightly as he tried to punch it away. Slices it off the outside half of the bat and Elliott has an easy offering. Warner c Elliott b Matt Henry 16(14) [4s-3]Matt Henry to Warner, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

AUSTRALIA:4.1 Matt Henry to Khawaja, SIX, brilliant catch from Williamson running backwards from mid-off. Kept his eyes on the ball right through after Khawaja mistimed his loft off the toe-end. The direction of his head and the body were in constant conflict but he overcame the odds and plucked it superbly. Only that he ends up crossing the boundary ropes in the process. So desperately unlucky. Seddon Park's diminutive size comes to Khawaja's rescue
AUSTRALIA:3.6 Milne to Warner, no run, short of length delivery just outside off, stabbed to backward point
AUSTRALIA:3.5 Milne to Warner, FOUR, can't do that with fine leg up. Falls away down the leg-side with this round the wicket angle. All Warner has to do is roll his wrists and glance it wide of short fine leg

AUSTRALIA:1.1 Milne to Warner, no run, dished up full and way wide outside off, would have been a wide if Warner left it alone. Instead, he stretches out to meet with a drive.

AUSTRALIA:0.3 Matt Henry to Khawaja, no run, much better. Sees the ball leaving him and shoulders arms
AUSTRALIA:0.2 Matt Henry to Khawaja, no run, and again. Careful Khawaja, careful. Give yourself time. Back of a length delivery pushed into the channel, unfurls those rubber wrists looking to whiplash the punch into the off-side, beaten again with the angle
AUSTRALIA:0.1 Matt Henry to Khawaja, no run, he's in such form at the moment that every delivery carries a boundary label on it. Goes flashing after a fullish ball angled across with no feet, is beaten on the edgeKhawaja and Warner are at the crease. Khawaja is on strike. Matt Henry will open the attackRight, so this is it. 247 to chase. Shouldn't be much of a struggle on what looks a really good wicket. Unless of course a couple of these Kiwi bowlers produce an inspired effort. The crowd's there of course. Right behind them, with everyone foaming at the mouth and wanting some Kangaroo meat. Can this fairytale come to life? Can they do it for McCullum? Here's Henry steaming in..So, New Zealand underwhelm. With 246 runs on the board when modern ODI trends suggest at least 275+ on any ground. Even on two MCGs stacked along each other. The self-inflicted pressure to bid a fairytale farewell showed and after a quick start, powered by McBomb for the last time and IPL-ignored Guptill, New Zealand swung arms and kept finding fielders waiting under it. Grant Elliott covered up for Anderson's struggles as he registered a half-century but couldn't stay the distance to effect the slogathon at the end. Mitchell Marsh ends up with 3 wickets, mostly giftwrapped ones but expect New Zeland to roar back. It's McCullum's swansong. Fasten your seat belts and get back to us in about 30 minutes..4
NEW ZEALAND:45.3 Hastings to Ish Sodhi, out Bowled!! This double blow seals the innings for New Zeland. A 246-all out effort. Slow ball strikes again. This time on a yorker length, Sodhi stoops to dig it out, does well to stop the ball with an angled bat only to see the ball dribble back and carress the stumps' base to flick the bail off. Ish Sodhi b Hastings 0(1)Hastings to Ish Sodhi, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Ish Sodhi, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:45.2 Hastings to Doug Bracewell, out Bowled!! That's how you welcome your guests. Open the door, the bat-pad gap here, to let it through you.

NEW ZEALAND:45.1 Hastings to Doug Bracewell, no run, walks across his stump to clip this full ball on middle and leg, misses and Wade clears his throat with a marooned singing appeal. Going down legJohn Hastings [7.0-0-42-0] is back into the attack
NEW ZEALAND:44.6 Boland to Matt Henry, no run, what's more baffling than reverse swing in New Zealand is the regularity with which Kiwis have found the fielders this morning. Driven straight to mid-on again
NEW ZEALAND:44.5 Boland to Matt Henry, no run, makes room to drive but gets an inside edge onto his pad, thanks to the late inward curl
NEW ZEALAND:44.4 Boland to Matt Henry, no run, slides deep in his crease and clips it to mid-wicketMatt Henry, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:44.3 Boland to Milne, out Lbw!! All the reverse swing has left this umpiring business on bit of a shaky ground. Tailing in full delivery, Milne aims to flick it into the leg-side and misses. Ball takes the front boot and definitely looked like going down leg. Milne has a mini-discussion before unfastening his gloves while walking off. That was going down leg by a distance, roars out the HawkEye. Milne lbw b Boland 5(4) [4s-1]Boland to Milne, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
NEW ZEALAND:44.3 Boland to Milne, wide, reverse swing? Tails in but the movement takes it down leg, Milne misses on what looked like a brutal glance

NEW ZEALAND:43.2 Mitchell Marsh to Elliott, out Caught by Maxwell!! And Marsh is on a hat-trick. Are they going all-attack a little too early? Or have they left their luck back in the dressing room? Fullish delivery outside off, Elliott stoops with a big front foot stride, fetches this ball with an intended uppish swipe and finds Maxwell at deep square leg. Cricket thrives on placement but not when you time them straight to the fielders. Elliott c Maxwell b Mitchell Marsh 50(62) [4s-1 6s-1]Mitchell Marsh to Elliott, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Doug Bracewell, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:43.1 Mitchell Marsh to Ronchi, out Caught by Boland!! This was a pie-catch. For Boland at long-on. Length ball, Ronchi all excited swings across the line, hardly gets a wood on this as the bat turns in his hands and finds a half-squatted Boland waiting reverse-cupped. This is such an anti-climax for an innings that could have potentially exploded. Ronchi c Boland b Mitchell Marsh 5(8)Mitchell Marsh to Ronchi, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
NEW ZEALAND:42.6 Hazlewood to Elliott, no run, gets forward and push-drives it back. Hazlewood tips it away whilst trying to stop and it is parries to cover
NEW ZEALAND:42.5 Hazlewood to Elliott, no run, jeers from the crowd as a leg-side delivery isn't called in a wide. Wade did well to dive to his left and cut that off. Can't fathom why it wasn't a wide, couldn't hear a noise either
NEW ZEALAND:42.4 Hazlewood to Elliott, no run, that was a mighty swing that bordered on the ugly. Shimmied, swung his arms and missed it out altogether. Then looks back and watches the keeper glove it
NEW ZEALAND:42.3 Hazlewood to Ronchi, 1 run, that high and dipping full toss should have seen the choked stands. Not to be. Patted to long-on for a lowly single
NEW ZEALAND:42.2 Hazlewood to Ronchi, no run, stabbed off the back foot to the right of the bowler and there's no run
NEW ZEALAND:42.1 Hazlewood to Ronchi, no run, loud, loud appeal for an LBW and Australia went up for the review. This yorker curled in to hit the boot on the full and HawkEye showed that the impact was just outside off. Technology, oh technology! And Smith was furious after that. Furious. That's the wordReview: For an LBW against Ronchi. Not out onfield. Fair delivery. IT has hit the toe on the full. Impact was outside off and it stays that way..
NEW ZEALAND:41.6 Mitchell Marsh to Elliott, SIX, that's how you embarrass something. Average length ball, Elliott stays put, swung his arms and thumped it over long-off.

NEW ZEALAND:41.3 Mitchell Marsh to Ronchi, 1 run, more room outside off this time and slashes to third man for a single

NEW ZEALAND:40.6 Hazlewood to Elliott, no run, backs away to free his arms but ends up chopping it to cover
NEW ZEALAND:40.5 Hazlewood to Elliott, no run, that tailed into Elliott and Hazlewood has his tongue out wagging to appreciate it. Elliott slid back to dig it out to cover-point

NEW ZEALAND:40.4 Hazlewood to Ronchi, wide, veering down the leg-side, Ronchi turns to tickle and missesLuke Ronchi, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:40.3 Hazlewood to Corey Anderson, out Caught by Khawaja!! That was like a daily soap's Friday mini-break only to resume on Monday with much disappointment. Looked like a clobber that had been middled but was hit straight down the throat of Khwaja at long-on. Pouched safely just inside the ropes. Anderson's struggle gets a lid now.

NEW ZEALAND:39.6 Mitchell Marsh to Corey Anderson, 1 run, taps it to gully and hares to the other end
NEW ZEALAND:39.5 Mitchell Marsh to Elliott, 1 run, this bounces just in front of Bailey at deep mid-wicket and he does well to stop it from going through. Flungs in front to reach but couldn't and then gets his body behind the ball. Gets up and spears back the throw to invite a heartful applause from Marsh. The ball was short and Elliott had pulled to allow Bailey to display all the agility there
NEW ZEALAND:39.4 Mitchell Marsh to Corey Anderson, 1 run, shows his bat face to third man and dabs it for the singlathon to continue
NEW ZEALAND:39.3 Mitchell Marsh to Corey Anderson, no run, back of a length ball ballooning up slowly off the pitch, Anderson holds back and then belatedly cuts it only to mistime it to backward point

NEW ZEALAND:38.6 Boland to Elliott, 1 run, a misfield at backward point by Maxwell means that this Elliott open-batted steer gets to third man
NEW ZEALAND:38.5 Boland to Elliott, FOUR, and there's some timing finally. The cabinet doors are open. Charges down, gets under this fullish ball and thumps it over mid-on for a one-bounce four

NEW ZEALAND:38.3 Boland to Corey Anderson, no run, charges down the pitch, Boland followed him and Anderson was cramped up for room. Sees the ball zoom back to the keeper between his bat-pad gap

NEW ZEALAND:9.3 Mitchell Marsh to Brendon McCullum, out Caught by Hastings!! In the air, it's gone many a mile .. and it's over. That's the last of Brendon McCullum in ODI cricket. A giant of this format is walking back to a standing ovation and he gives them a nice wave while sauntering away into the sunset. Came down the track to slog, but didn't get on top of the bounce and sliced it off a thick outside edge. The ball skied up, swirled and swirled, and never looked like coming down. There is confusion between Hastings and Maxwell, the former calls for it. Moves to his left and ends up having to dive with both hands. Plucks it safely to break a lot of hearts. Actually on a second glance, it looks like Hastings ran a long way from mid-on, and ended up taking it at mid-off. Should have been Maxwell's catch but for some strange reason he backed off.

NEW ZEALAND:8.5 Hazlewood to Guptill, FOUR, Guptill's starting to get hold of these pull shots now. Banged in on a short of length, rises till around chest height but it's not enough to trouble the tall frame of Guptill. Slaps it behind square
NEW ZEALAND:8.4 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, length ball outside off, knocked into the off-side

NEW ZEALAND:8.2 Hazlewood to Brendon McCullum, no run, short of length delivery wide of off, McCullum makes room and glides it to backward point
NEW ZEALAND:8.1 Hazlewood to Guptill, 5 runs, geez that's sloppy! Zampa is slow to back up at mid-on and allows the overthrows. Short of length delivery around off, Guptill drops it with soft hands towards Wade and is called through for the run. He looked to be struggling at the non-striker's end as Wade rifled in a throw. Couldn't effect a direct hit though and no backing up means overthrows
NEW ZEALAND:7.6 Boland to Brendon McCullum, SIX, 200 ODI sixes for Brendon McCullum! Shimmies down the track while moving across the stumps, manages to convert it into a half-volley while getting right behind the line and whips it over square leg. Furious wrists. And now Baz is cooking
NEW ZEALAND:7.5 Boland to Brendon McCullum, no run, length ball on middle, forward and defended
NEW ZEALAND:7.4 Boland to Brendon McCullum, no run, how has he managed to get beaten on the outside edge by a length ball down leg. Credit to Boland for smartly following him, then holds its line from a length as Baz switched to defence and left him squared up
NEW ZEALAND:7.3 Boland to Brendon McCullum, SIX, here he comes, here he comes! Dances down while making some room and hoists a length ball just over the wide long-off fence. The aim was to go much straighter but the bat-face turned slightly on impact. Enough though
NEW ZEALAND:7.2 Boland to Brendon McCullum, no run, length ball angled in on middle, tucked to mid-wicket
NEW ZEALAND:7.1 Boland to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, he's looking a determined fellow. Not at all playing like a slogger today. Much prepared to take his time and maintain his balance. Low full toss just outside off, McCullum capitalizes on Boland's benevolence by unleashing a gorgeous cover drive
NEW ZEALAND:6.6 Hazlewood to Guptill, FOUR, he's got it away this time. After missing out on two previous pull strokes, Guptill swats this one away behind square. Sped off the willow
NEW ZEALAND:6.5 Hazlewood to Guptill, SIX, ho, that's gone for six. Has to do with these short boundaries I guess. Just a mere pick-up over the on-side. Fullish on off, Guptill flogs it with a whiplash of the wrists over wide long-on
NEW ZEALAND:6.4 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, punched off the back foot but not past the umbrella of fielders in the off-side

NEW ZEALAND:6.2 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, half forward to a length ball just outside off, drives it softly to cover

NEW ZEALAND:5.6 Boland to Brendon McCullum, SIX, oh, sweet! Pitched up in his half and McCullum goes bang. Clears his front leg so that it doesn't hinder his batswing and pumps it over long-off. Lands in those grass banks well beyond the ropes
NEW ZEALAND:5.5 Boland to Guptill, 1 run, tight run but Guptill has picked the right man. Dinks it in front of mid-on where Hastings is a little stiff. Also caught on his heels slightly. Enables Guptill to make his ground at the non-striker's end
NEW ZEALAND:5.4 Boland to Guptill, no run, half a stride forward to gently drive a length delivery towards mid-off
NEW ZEALAND:5.3 Boland to Brendon McCullum, 1 run, has been a rather cautious start by McCullum's standards. Just pushes a length ball down to long-on to rotate strike

NEW ZEALAND:5.1 Boland to Brendon McCullum, no run, fullish on off, pushes it with a closed bat-face to mid-wicketScott Boland, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack

NEW ZEALAND:4.5 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, stays rooted in the crease to stonewall a back of a length delivery
NEW ZEALAND:4.4 Hazlewood to Guptill, FOUR, just trying to be a bit too premeditated.

NEW ZEALAND:4.3 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, turns this back of a length delivery into the on-side defensively
NEW ZEALAND:4.2 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, through with the pull too early. Expected the short ball to come a lot quicker than it did. Also the fact that he was picking it up from just outside off made it difficult. Bobs it towards first slip off the absolute bottom of the bat
NEW ZEALAND:4.1 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, angling in on the hips, tucked to mid-wicket
NEW ZEALAND:3.6 Hastings to Guptill, 1 run, good work at cover. Saved a few runs. Driven ferociously by Guptill, and Marsh was standing close-in as well. Dives to his right and gets a hand to make a half-stop
NEW ZEALAND:3.5 Hastings to Guptill, no run, length ball outside off, chopped towards cover. Went too hard on that cross-batted drive
NEW ZEALAND:3.4 Hastings to Guptill, SIX, he's launched that over long-off! Pitched up outside off, and Guptill lays into it. Plonks his front foot forward and swings it through the lineHastings loses the ball in his run-up, just slipped out of the fingers causing the crowd to get all worked up. Not really sure why though. Just too much excitement out there given the context
NEW ZEALAND:3.3 Hastings to Brendon McCullum, 1 run, full ball on middle and leg, McCullum whips it down to long-on who has been pushed to the ropes
NEW ZEALAND:3.2 Hastings to Guptill, 1 run, fraction full outside off, enough to tempt Guptill into carving it through the off-side. Slices it off the outside edge instead and it soars down towards third man

NEW ZEALAND:2.4 Hazlewood to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, this is actually well bowled from Hazlewood. Saw McCullum making some room and cramped him with a short of length delivery which nipped back in slightly. McCullum still tries to go through with the cut but has no room to play with.

NEW ZEALAND:1.3 Hastings to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, wow, just sit back and treasure every moment of this. The iconic charge down the wicket, and heaves it through mid-wicket. Couldn't quite get hold of the slog and ended up dragging it off the inside half of the bat, but it raced away after clearing the infield
NEW ZEALAND:1.2 Hastings to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, there he goes. It took all of four balls to open his arms. A hint of swing back in but the length was very full, McCullum just slaps it over the bowler's head

NEW ZEALAND:0.5 Hazlewood to Brendon McCullum, no run, edgy, edgy. You can feel the tension. It's palpable. Length ball angled in towards leg, McCullum again is left flat-footed as he tries to work it through the on-side, inside edges it onto pad and the ball rolls away towards the cordon
NEW ZEALAND:0.4 Hazlewood to Brendon McCullum, no run, ha, he's getting a look-in. On a back of a length around off, stays leg-side of it and punches to backward point. The bottom hand came off the handle

NEW ZEALAND:0.1 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, and straightaway in the channel. Curls away beautifully from a length, has Guptill engrossed in a loose drive with no feet and he chops it off an inside edge back down the pitchGuptill and Brendon McCullum are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Hazlewood will open the attackMcCullum walks through a guard of honour given by Steve Smith and his men. Huge ovation for the man from the crowd. Okay, it's Hazlewood to start off with a couple of slips..Hearing that Boult is unwell today. Even Mitchell Santner isn't a 100%. Fairly big blows for the Kiwis given how well they have performed so far. The Aussies, however, are unchanged. Believe me when I say that I haven't been this excited for covering a match. Just five minutes before McCullum walks out with bat in hand.Baz: "We would have bowled first as well. Boulty is out with a niggle. Sodhi is an exciting talent and on this surface he will get bounce. Series on the line, playing in front of a big crowd is exciting. Weren't too bad in the last game, just a little off in a few areas. Been a long time representing the country. Would be a tinge of sadness later on when it is over. But first, we have a job to do."Smith: "It's quite a small ground and we have been chasing pretty well. Pretty evenly matched statistics wise. Same team as the last one."Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Usman Khawaja, David Warner, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), John Hastings, Adam Zampa, Scott Boland, Josh HazlewoodNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Kane Williamson, Henry Nicholls, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Doug Bracewell, Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Ish SodhiAustralia have won the toss and have opted to fieldAs it happens, it's also the deciding 3rd match of this Chappell-Hadlee ODI series which is tied at 1-1. Boy, how New Zealand would like to gift their hero a farewell gift! Seddon Park is the setting for today's rubber game and I am hearing it will be a sellout. The man who motivated and galvanized an entire nation during the World Cup, the man who made watching cricket a cool thing in a Rugby nation, has got an entire army behind his back.ODI Cricket will attract a lot more bowlers after today. There won't be anyone charging with a chainsaw in hand threatening to blast them to hell. It's a poignant moment in our sport where one of the pioneers of modern batting will be playing his final innings in coloured clothing for New Zealand. Thank You Baz, for all the thrills and spills. For the exhilaration. For the ruthlessness.Teams:New Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Henry Nicholls, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell, Colin Munro, Ish SodhiAustralia (From): David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), John Hastings, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland, Marcus Stoinis, Joel Paris, Shaun MarshLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
