Malinga will open the attackRight, we are set for the Malinga v Watson contest first upAustralian bowlers have had their say restricting Sri Lanka for a modest 208. They have Shane Watson at the top of the order. This match can finish very quickly if he starts to fire. SL have a bow of their own in the form of Lasith Malinga.It has been another impressive performance from the Aussie bowlers. Every bowler managed to pick up atleast one wicket. The Sri Lankans never got going at any stage. Sanga looked good when he was out there but perished to a poor shot. A few lusty blows from Kulasekara in the end ensured that they got past 200. The Australians will back themselves to chase it down comfortably but this is a more potent attack. If Malinga gets it right in his opening spell then it will be a tough task for the Aussies. Join us in a short while to see what happens.4

There is a sparse crowd at the moment but many more might trickle in after the news goes around that SL are batting.Hambantota is one of the biggest stadiums that one will come across in any part of the world.Mahela Jayawardene:  There are some wonderful facilities here at Hambantota. I enjoyed playing on this pitch though it was against Canada. I want to spend time out in the middle, I enjoy batting at the top of the order, but I am prepared to go according to the situation and the game plan. Australia are a fine side, we did not bat well in the 1st match. We need to bat in partnerships and post a decent score. I am a Man Utd fan and I hope they will start in a winning fashion though I might not be able to watch the match.Shane Watson: The bats nowadays are big and beautiful. I use a pretty heavy bat. It is a Gunn and Moore bat. It weighs around 2 pounds 10 ounces to 2 pound 11 ounces. It is a little heavier than that of Ricky and Hussey. I am loving every bit of the opportunity that I have been provided with. We are loving the conditions over here and we are playing as a settled unit. Our batting was a bit light in the 2 T20 games but the presence of Ricky, Mike Hussey and Clarke has been great for the teams. We hope to continue to do well in the remainder of the tour.Pitch Report: It is very hot today and there is a lot of breeze blowing over. There are a lot of cracks on the surface which have opened up thanks to the heat. The pitch will be slow and low and there will be some uneven bounce. The spinners should enjoy bowling on this surface. A score of around 250-260 should be very competitive.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke(c), Michael Hussey, David Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Xavier Doherty, Doug BollingerSri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha MendisClarke: Same team. No change for us. I'm a little concerned about the lights. They are a fair distance away and it could be a little difficult to spot the ball. I would have probably batted first too.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batDilshan: I'm going to bat first. The last two days have been the same. The wicket is a bit dry. Malinga is back and it is good news. It is a plus for our side. He is going to enjoy the wind. Herath is in for Randiv.Hello and welcome to our coverage of the second ODI between Sri Lanka and Australia. Sri Lanka are the wounded lions after being thrashed in the first game. They were a confident lot after winning the two T20Is but the bolstered Aussie ODI side showed that they were not going to be pushovers in this format. Malinga could come in to boost the Sri Lankan attack. Wait to find out if he is in and other team updates along with the toss in just a short while.Preview by Gokul GopalFollowing the back-to-back losses in the T20 games, Australia bounced back in style to trash Sri Lanka in the opening ODI. While the visitors would be hoping to continue in the same vein, The home team would want to consider the loss as an one-off game and look to hit back hard at the Aussies.Australia: While Cameron White could not quite inspire the Aussies in the T20 matches, the Michael Clarke led side turned the heat on the Lankans in the opening game to secure a comfortable 7-wicket victory. Mitchell Johnson was the wrecker in chief as his career-best figures of 6/31 rattled the home team and restricted them to a below par total of 191. The other bowlers too did their part with Brett Lee, Doug Bollinger and Xavier Doherty keeping things tight and also chipping in with wickets. The bowlers had to be commended as the Sri Lankan opening pair got off to a good start but the Aussies' perseverence paid off and wickets kept falling at regular intervals.Australia's batting effort was both explosive and solid. Shane Watson blew the Lankans away with a quick-fire half century while Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke put on an intelligent partnership while going past their fifties. Clarke, who was there till the end to see the team through, would have been delighted with the effort of the team. The Kangaroos, who have a very balanced batting and bowling attacks, would be hoping for a similar performance to go 2-0 up.Sri Lanka: Tillakaratne Dilshan and his team were impressive in the Twenty20 matches. But, witnessing the opening ODI, they seem to be stuck in the T20 mindset with most of their batsmen perishing to ill-advised strokes instead of trying to settle down first and then playing the extravagant shots. The start provided by the openers was impressive but the performance from the middle order left a lot to be desired. Despite having the experienced pair of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, the home team collapsed badly and it required a 60-run stand for the 8th wicket between Suraj Randiv and Nuwan Kulasekara to lend the Sri Lankan total some kind of respectability.The Sri Lankan bowlers did not have much to defend after a poor showing from their batsmen. But whatever little score they had was quickly eaten away by the aggressive Shane Watson and any thoughts of Sri Lanka fighting back after the opener's wicket was put to rest by Ponting and Clarke. The Lankan bowlers had nothing much to show apart from Randiv who picked up a couple of wickets. Dilshan would be hoping from a better all-round effort from his team and would particularly demand better discipline and judgement from the batsmen.Quotes:I'm happy with our performance, but we've still got a long way to go and I hope that (this) is just the start of what's to come: Michael Clarke, following the team's win in the opening ODI.You know it's always going to be a challenge in these conditions. It's always hot, the wickets are always pretty flat and slow: Mitchell Johnson, relishes the challenge of bowling on flat Sri Lankan wickets.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Shaminda Eranga, Rangana Herath, Mahela Jayawardene, Suraj Randiv, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Jeevan Mendis, Thissara Perera, Chamara Silva, Lasith Malinga, Upul TharangaAustralia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Brad Haddin(w), John Hastings, David Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Shaun Marsh, James Pattinson, Steven Smith, Shane Watson, Doug Bollinger, Ricky Ponting, Xavier Doherty, Michael HusseyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
