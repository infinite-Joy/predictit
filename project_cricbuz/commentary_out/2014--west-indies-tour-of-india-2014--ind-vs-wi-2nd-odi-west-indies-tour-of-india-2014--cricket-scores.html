Bhuvneshwar will open the attackDwayne Smith and Darren Bravo are walking out to the middle to open. It was his brother opening in the previous match and it's junior Bravo's turn today. Bhuvi will open the bowling for India, two slips in placeWelcome back for the chase...Dhoni would be relatively happy to see 263/7 on the board, considering that the ball is not coming onto the bat. Though openers Dhawan and Rahane failed, Kohli and Rayudu combined well to steady the ship for a while, before the latter threw it away. Kohli and Raina then recorded their 4th 100+ stand in ODIs to lift the Indian dressing room. Both registered fifties, 31st and 30th respectively and Kohli, who was batting at number four, had a big smile on his face after getting to the milestone. The West Indies bowlers then took pace off the ball and made life really difficult for the batsmen. In the end, Dhoni scored a fighting 50 to push the score past 260. Taylor was the pick of the bowlers for the visitors as he accounted for three wickets. Interestingly, the last time India played at Delhi, they defended 167, against Pakistan. Can MS Dhoni & Co. register a win here? Or, will West Indies make it 2-0? We'll find out soon...4

Rahane is on strike. Rampaul will open the attackIndian openers Shikhar Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane have walked out to the middle. Rampaul will start proceedings for West Indies with 2 slips in place. Here we go with the first ball...Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Dwayne Smith, Dwayne Bravo(c), Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Darren Sammy, Sulieman Benn, Ravi Rampaul, Jerome TaylorIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Umesh YadavDwayne Bravo: "We wanted to bat first as well. We will have to restrict them as low as possible and chase it down later in the night. We have to be consistent. We have won four ODIs in a row. The boys are in good spirits. We are playing the same team."MS Dhoni: "We are looking to bat first. It looks a good wicket. It would stay the same. It is very important to take wickets in the middle overs. It means the slog starts early (if you don't take wickets in the middle). You will always accumulate more than what's the par score. We have a forced change. Umesh comes in for injured Mohit.India have won the toss and have opted to batHeads is the call from DJ Bravo. Tails it isPitch report: "This looks like a regular Delhi pitch. There is a little bit of grass, the ball will carry through. The batsmen will enjoy it as well. The pitch will remain the same throughout. Any team that bats first will want to get closer to 300" reckon Sunil Gavaskar and Michael HoldingDespite being troubled by pay disputes, Marlon Samuels was simply outstanding a couple of days ago. Denesh Ramdin has been in the form of his life. Though Sunil Narine is missing from the line-up, the bowling is well equipped to topple any side on their day. Is Lendl Simmons available for selection? We'll find out soon as the toss is just moments away. Stay tuned...Meanwhile, all eyes will be on India's star batsman, Virat Kohli. Shockingly, he has not crossed 50 in his last 7 ODIs and it is high time that he gets his form back in familiar conditions. In fact, playing at his home ground, he would look to turn the tables around today. Interestingly, the last time Ishant Sharma bowled an over in India, he went for 30 runs. Yes! That match against Australia at Mohali, when James Faulkner took him to the cleaners. But, that was almost an year ago and hopefully he is an improved bowler now.During the toss at Kochi, Dhoni clearly mentioned that he is still unsure of who the third seamer would be for India at the World Cup. The injury to Mohit Sharma, who has been ruled out for the rest of the series, has further deepened the crisis. Interestingly, Ishant Sharma has been roped into the side and is most likely to take the field today. With Dhoni stating that he wants to have a look at three seamers in this series, it will be interesting to see Kuldeep Yadav's chances as well.Hello and a warm welcome to game number two of the 5-match ODI series. West Indies are on a high after their thumping win in the first ODI at Kochi and they would be keen to repeat their performance here in Delhi as well. On the other hand, MS Dhoni's men, who have been playing well in the 50-over format barring the Kochi ODI, will be keen to quickly leave the loss behind and put up an impressive all-round show today.PreviewStill licking their wounds after a sound thrashing in the opener, India will have to regroup quickly and plug the loopholes when they take on a determined West Indies in the second cricket one-dayer in New Delhi on Saturday. Starting the series as overwhelming favourites, India's inept batting in the first match led to a crushing 124-run defeat against a side, which was threatening to pull-out of the series due to a payment dispute with their parent body and cricketers union.The Caribbean players did a commendable job, leaving behind distractions and disappointment of not having at least their top two players -- Chris Gayle and Sunil Narine -- in the side. If Gayle was recovering from a hamstring injury then off-spinner Narine, who had to miss the Champions League T20 final for Kolkata Knight Riders because of being called twice for chucking, was withdrawn from the series to work on his action.India though will hope to draw level at Feroz Shah Kotla, where pitches have improved off late and a keen contest is on the cards.However with India's World Cup preparations starting with this series, Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be looking to set his combination in order before the team travels Down Under in six weeks time. The batting slots are more or less fixed even though the side was shot out for a paltry 197 on a belter of a track at Kochi.The biggest concern is Virat Kohli's prolonged lean patch since the tour of England. Even former skipper Sunil Gavaskar has spoken openly about Kohli's technical flaws but opined that the talented batsman should be dropped down the order to make him get back to his run-making ways.India's fortunes in this series and their title defence in the upcoming 50-over showpiece event depends a lot on Kohli's form.The only spot that is not confirmed is that of Ambati Rayudu, who has got a break due to Rohit Sharma's injury. Rayudu has not exactly set the stage on fire and would like to make best use of the opportunities before a fit-again Rohit is available for selection. The opening slot is also a matter of concern as Shikhar Dhawan, who was top-scorer in the first match, didn't look convincing with his shot selection. With Murali Vijay in the dressing room and Unmukt Chand waiting in the wings, the team management would expect Dhawan to pull up his socks.Bowling is also a big worry for India as the hosts conceded 321 runs -- another 300 plus score on home soil in the past one year. The spinners leaked 142 runs in 22 overs in Kochi and that cost India dearly. The hosts would expect their spinners to do better in home conditions. While Dhoni did not criticize his bowlers, the spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Amit Mishra performed below-par while Mohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami, who did bag a four-wicket haul, bowled too many loose deliveries. Ishant Sharma's return will bolster the bowling attack, though it remains to be seen whether Dhoni inducts the lanky pacer into the XI. Sharma has been drafted into the team in place of an injured Mohit Sharma. It will be interesting to see if chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav is blooded since Dhoni does not believe in too much chopping and changing.West Indies, on the other hand, are heavily dependant on senior players like captain Dwayne Bravo, Marlon Samuels and Kieron Pollard. With acrimonious relation with their WIPA chief Wavell Hinds reaching an all-time low, the West Indies will be hoping that they can keep their on-field focus intact despite the off-field distractions.The way Marlon Samuels and Denesh Ramdin batted, the Windies have actually shown that other issues do take a back seat when they take field. While the Caribbean side is looking to keep the momentum going, India cannot afford to lose another match, as trailing 0-2 in a five match series would put the hosts under tremendous pressure.Teams (from):India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (C), Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Murali Vijay, Kuldeep Yadav.West Indies: Dwayne Bravo (C), Darren Bravo, Jason Holder, Leon Johnson, Kieron Pollard, Denesh Ramdin, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Andre Russel, Darren Sammy, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Smith, Jerome Taylor.Match starts at 2.30 pm (IST).Teams:West Indies (From): Dwayne Smith, Dwayne Bravo(c), Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Darren Sammy, Sulieman Benn, Ravi Rampaul, Jerome Taylor, Lendl Simmons, Kemar Roach, Leon Johnson, Jason HolderIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(c/w), Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Kuldeep Yadav, Murali VijayLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
