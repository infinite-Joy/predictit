The WC campaign was not great, we want some more momentum and finish the campaign on a highPitch Report: It is a fairly docile pitch. The ball should come on nicely to the bat. It might slow down as the match progresses. The team winning the toss might opt to bat first.James Pattinson makes his ODI debut for Australia. He replaces the rested Brett Lee.

Australia cruised towards an easy 9 wicket victory in the second ODI thanks largely to an one man show from Shane Watson to wrap up the series 2-0. Watson recorded the highest individual run score for Australia as well as creating a new World Record for the most number of sixes in an innings. It remains to be seen as to how the Bangladesh bowlers have coped up to the brutal assault. Australia might well rest either Lee or Johnson and hand an international debut for James Pattinson, the younger brother of Darren Pattinson who has played a test match for England. Bangladesh might replace Raqibul with either Alok Kapali or give an international debut to Shuvagoto Hom. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates.By Karthik LApart from being Michael Clarke's first full series as skipper, the Australia v Bangladesh series didn't have much to look forward to. The first game did nothing much to change that, as Australia completed a comfortable win over the hosts. But 96 balls and 15 sixers in the 2nd game made sure that all the attention was back to Mirpur.Bangladesh: To be fair, Bangladesh couldn't have done anything better. They backed their strength - spin - but were simply outclassed by 2 individual brilliances in 2 games. Michael Clarke played a captain's knock in the first and Shane Watson went berserk in the next. The pacers didn't have enough teeth while the spinners, apart from skipper Shakib Al Hasan, have all struggled to penetrate a mighty batting line up. The woes of Bangladesh is best described by Suhrawadi Shuvo - he picked up 3 wickets in the first game but went for 46 runs in 3 overs in the next, which included 4 consecutive sixers from Watson.
Compared to their bowling, they have been much better with the bat. Their 2 reliable stars - Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan have scored fifties, while Mushfiqur Rahim looks in terrific touch with unbeaten knocks of 44 and 81 in the 2 games. The 2nd one in particular was a class act and helped Bangladesh recover from dire straits to post a decent total(230 was decent before Watson decided otherwise). The home team could take heart from the fact that such knocks don't occur everyday and would desperately be looking up to their other top order batsmen to rescue some pride.Australia: Australia have done most things right in the series so far. Powered by Clarke's century, they managed to post a big total on a slow track in the first game. Then followed a thumping performance in the next. Most of their batsmen have got off to starts and would be looking to convert them if the opportunity arrives in the final game.
The bowlers have been clinical at the top but have had some finishing problems. In both the games, they have allowed the lower middle order to revive after removing the top order early. Their spinners have been economical but Clarke would like them to be among the wickets. As the series is already won, they may look to rest a pacer to give James Pattinson a debut game.Quotes:"It would be best if we don't think about this Watson innings and instead think about continuing our batting positives." Shahriar Nafees"I was thinking I hadn't seen consistent hitting like that since probably Gilly in the World Cup final in 2007."
