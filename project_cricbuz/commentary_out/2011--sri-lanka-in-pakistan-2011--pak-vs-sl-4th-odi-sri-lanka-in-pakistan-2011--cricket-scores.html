Tharanga is on strike. Umar Gul will open the attackRight, the players are back on the field. The chase will begin in a few moments.Sri Lanka have bowled exceptionally well at Sharjah today. Their fielding, barring a few dropped catches and fumbles, was sharp. What stood out was the effort of the young 'part time' spinner Jeevan Mendis who bowled 9 overs for 40 runs. He picked up 2 crucial wickets of Malik and Umar Akmal. Both of his wickets came of googlies and considering that he got them against players who can play spin really well, he will feel happy about himself. But undoubtedly, the standout bowler was Fernando who bowled 3 maidens on the trot and picked up 3 wickets giving away just 26 runs in his 10 overs. Had it not been for an excellent counter-attacking half century from an uncharacteristic Afridi, Pakistan might well have gotten less than 200. It will be an interesting chase, do join us in half an hour.4

Sid V here to start off proceedings.Pitch Report: The outfield is thick and there will be some dew in the evening. There is less grass on this wicket and it has been rolled in. The pitch will get slower and it will get lower. The best time to bat will be during the new ball. Russell Arnold reckons that a score of 260 is a good score on this track.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Farhat, Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Umar Gul, Aizaz Cheema, Saeed AjmalSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Thissara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara FernandoDilshan: I would have batted first and we are unchanged. We need to restrict Pakistan to just 240-250. The fast bowlers are doing well and we have to continue bowling well.Misbah: This pitch is better than the one on which the Test match was played. Shoaib Malik and Aizaz Cheema are back. Sohail Tanvir is not playing.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to batSharjah is hosting their 201st ODI today, which is the most for any venue in the world. The last time an ODI was played here was between Afghanistan and Canada in February 2010.Hello and Welcome to the 4th ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka from Sharjah. Pakistan will be looking to seal the series today at a venue where they have enjoyed tremendous success in the past. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will be very disappointed with their batting in the previous ODI and they have an uphill task to keep the series alive. Once again, it is the 'Two Sids' show here. I, Sid V, will be joined by Sid P. Stay tuned for the toss and the team news.Preview by PradeepThe series moves from Dubai to Sharjah, but there seems to be no end to the woes of Sri Lanka. They went into the third ODI with some confidence, started slowly, hit back in the middle and towards the end of the Pakistan innings, set up a reasonable chase. Despite not starting the chase brightly, they looked well in control until the mandatory batting powerplay in the 36th over. Things began to change in that little passage of play and Sri Lanka ended up losing a match that was well in their grasp.The series has now reached a tipping point for Sri Lanka. They need nothing short of two straight wins to go back home with something to show for their efforts. Pakistan have grown in confidence as the series has progressed and will quietly fancy their chances of sealing a series victory at a venue that has been a home away from home for them.Pakistan: One of the biggest positives to have emerged from the Test and ODI series is the unity of the current Pakistan team. This can be attributed to the fact that they have been led by a man who has displayed a very calm and collective mindset during times of crisis. The solidity of the opening pair is another area which had bogged down the team from a number of years. Imran Farhat and Mohammad Hafeez seem to have solved that problem at least for a certain amount of time. The solidity of the opening pair has allowed the middle order to blossom. The power-hitters deceived to flatter during the 3rd ODI, but if there is one lower middle order the bowlers across the world fear, it must be that of Pakistan.The bowling unit looks very settled. Umar Gul has lead the attack with aplomb and has been well supported by the likes of Cheema and Razzaq. Saeed Ajmal is adding to his reputation while Afridi continues to dazzle with the ball in his hand. The revelation though has been Hafeez. One expected the experienced Sri Lankan batsmen to prosper against him, but Hafeez has troubled them with clever variations. He has been the most economical of the bowlers and has wickets to boot as well.Sri Lanka: The team from the island nation looks like a ragged outfit at the moment. Their spirits were up after the 2nd ODI only to be punctured by some poor cricket in the final 15 overs of the chase in the last game. Most of the batsmen have got starts but have not converted it into something bigger. They have not been helped by some of the team management's bizarre tactics like the one in the last match where they promoted Lasith Malinga to No.7 during the batting PP. Ideally, in such a scenario one would expect a power-hitter to be up the order and the visitors did have one in the form of Thissara Perera. He was instead somewhat wasted at No. 9. Sri Lanka rely heavily on their top-order and one of them must get a big ton if they are to challenge their formidable opponents in the do or die encounter. The bowling continues to remain a problem. Perera has been their best bowler so far while their pace spearhead Malinga was off colour in the last match. With the series hanging by the thread, Sri Lanka will hope for their champion to rise up to the occasion. Dilhara Fernando has been very expensive in the matches so far while the spinners have kept the batsmen honest without troubling them in any manner.Team News: Pakistan has no major worries to think about. Abdul Razzaq seems to be the only weak link at the moment but may retain his place. For Sri Lanka, Dilhara Fernando has been very expensive and might be benched in favour of either Suraj Randiv or Chanaka Welegedara.Final Word: Pakistan has played 108 ODIs at Sharjah which is more then the number of matches they have played in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi put together. They have won a whopping 74 of those and have a W/L ratio of 2.24:1. Sri Lanka's task has just got tougher.Teams:Pakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdur Rehman, Aizaz Cheema, Asad Shafiq, Imran Farhat, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Malik, Umar Gul, Younis Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shahid Afridi, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Sohail Tanvir, Umar AkmalSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene, Suraj Randiv, Kosala Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dilhara Fernando, Dimuth Karunaratne, Lasith Malinga, Jeevan Mendis, Thissara Perera, Upul Tharanga, Seekkuge PrasannaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
