Clint McKay will open for Australia.England will be really happy to keep Australia to a paltry total on a good batting surface. From 209/5, Australia have collapsed tremendously to lose 5 wickets in the next 18 runs. England skipper Eoin Morgan mentioned at the toss about using the moisture on the surface. His bowlers did exactly that and removed the top-order for almost nothing. But Bailey batted sensibly and made a fine fifty alongside Adam Voges. With Matthew Wade at the other end, it looked like Australia were easily going to go past 260, but James Tredwell cameback really well after being thrashed earlier in the spell. His three wickets came at a very vital time as England did really well in the death overs. England should have this easily if they bat well. Take a break and join us back for their reply.4

Good length delivery outside off stump, very similar to the previous one, Bailey again pokes at this one and this time he gets a faint edge which goes through to Buttler at a very good height. Bailey will be kicking himself. All the hard work done by him has been undone in the last 15 minutes by England.
