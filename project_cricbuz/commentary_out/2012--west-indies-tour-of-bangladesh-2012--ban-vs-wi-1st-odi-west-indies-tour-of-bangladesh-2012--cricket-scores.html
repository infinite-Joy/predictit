We will back ourselves to put up a big score on the board. We have done well to adapt to the conditions.'Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Naeem Islam, Mahmudullah, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza, Sohag Gazi, Abul Hasan, Abdur RazzakWest Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Lendl Simmons, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Darren Sammy(c), Sunil Narine, Devon Thomas(w), Ravi Rampaul, Kemar RoachWest Indies have won the toss and elected to batHello and a warm welcome to the coverage of the 1st ODI between West Indies and Bangladesh. The hosts were completely outplayed in the 2 Test series, but their expertise lies in the shorter formats and they would like to prove just that against the T20 Champions. They will however, have to do without their star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who is out with an injury. Stay tuned for the toss and pitch reportPreviewA 2-0 drubbing in the Test series by West Indies, would have surely lowered the morale in the Bangladeshi camp. However, the fact that the drubbing was dished out on Bangladesh's home soil, would have definitely left Mushfiqur Rahim and his side hurting. There is no doubt then, that Bangladesh will be eager for vengeance.West Indies on the other hand have pretty much everything going their way. Before dominating Bangladesh in the recently concluded Test series, the men from the caribbean have managed to beat New Zealand in Tests, clinch the World T20 2012 title and are currently on a terrific run. With some big hitters coming in to join the One Day squad, the visitors might just be able to come up trumps in the limited overs series.Team NewsBangladesh: The hosts will be missing a key player in Shakib Al Hasan, someone who hasn't missed an ODI since 2008. The absence of a Shakib will surely leave a hug void in Bangladesh's line up, one they might struggle to fill. Mominul Haque has been called in to replace the all rounder but there is sure to be some pressure on the uncapped 21 year old.The batting will depend heavily on the likes of Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim. Iqbal has been a regular feature in Bangladesh's limited overs outings and has the experience and the ability to put together a big innings at a good pace. Bangladesh has the benefit of being able to field a few all rounders, in Mahmudullah and Naeem Islam.As far as the bowling is concerned, the pace attack should be spearheaded by Mashrafe Mortaza and the experienced campaigner should be backed up by Rubel Hossain. As usual, Bangladesh will look to employ a lot of spin by playing Abur Razzak and could include Sohag Gazi, someone who made quite an impact in the Test series. The side looks like a balanced one, however, the absence of Shakib is bound to deplete the team of some quality.West Indies: Darren Sammy and his side are coming of a fine period of cricket and the morale in the dressing room is bound to be on a high. Chris Gayle wasn't at his fiery best during the Test series, however, the left handed opener should feel a lot more comfortable in the limited overs format. Dwayne Smith could be asked to open alongside Gayle and in that case, West Indies would have an opening pair that could devastate just about any attack. The likes of Lendl Simmons and Darren Bravo add a lot of stability to this batting line up, while the lower middle order comprises of some all rounders who can really give the ball a whack.Marlon Samuels, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell and Sammy add a lot of balance to this side by contributing immensely with the bat and ball. The bowling looks quite the part as well, with Kemar Roach and Ravi Rampaul leading the pace attack. One man who will be under the spotlight is Sunil Narine. The mystery spinner had a rather mysterious time in the Test series as he failed to make a bug impact and Narine will be required to contribute a lot more in the limited overs format. However, considering that the spinner did make his mark in the shorter formats, it will not be a surprise if his form changes for the better in the ODI series.Final Word: West Indies are a side bursting with confidence at the moment and with Bangladesh not having the services of their key man, the visitors could turn out to be the better side in the 1st ODI.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Abdur Razzak, Naeem Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mahmudullah, Shafiul Islam, Sohag Gazi, Abul Hasan, Rubel Hossain, Anamul Haque, Mashrafe Mortaza, Jahurul Islam, Mominul HaqueWest Indies (From): Lendl Simmons, Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Devon Thomas(w), Kieron Pollard, Darren Sammy(c), Veerasammy Permaul, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Andre Russell, Kieran Powell, Kemar Roach, Jason HolderLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
