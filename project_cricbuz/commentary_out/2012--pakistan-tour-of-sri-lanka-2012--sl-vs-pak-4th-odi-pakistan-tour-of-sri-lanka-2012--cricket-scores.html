Malinga will open the attackWelcome back, the players are out in the middle and are ready for the chaseThat ends Sri Lanka's innings and they have managed to put up a decent total on this wicket. The hosts started off quite slowly and the game was interrupted with a bit of rain. After that break though, Sangakkara and Mahela took the game by the scruff of its neck and added on a partnership over 100. At that stage it looked as though Sri Lanka would run away with the game, however, Pakistan's bowlers came back well to pick up a few wickets towards the end and restricted the opposition to a score that can be chased. Mahela was bowled off a no ball which wasn't spotted by anyone and maybe the correct decision there could have taken Sri Lanka to a much better total. Anyway as it stands Pakistan have to chase 244, do join us for the same in about 30 minutes.4

We are set for the start of the 4th ODIPitch Report: It is clear at the moment and the forecast is for some showers later. The pitch looks good, there are runs to be scored on the surface. A score around 240 will be good for the team batting first.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi, Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul, Saeed AjmalSri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene(c), Thissara Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Sajeewa WeerakoonMisbah: Not too worried about losing the toss. Our new ball bowlers have done very well in the series so far and hope to do the same again. We must play as a unit to get a positive result. No changes in our team as well.Mahela: We cannot control the situation regarging the forecasts. We will bat first. We have no changes in our team. We have to play a tactical game against Pakistan. This is a tough series and we need to play well.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batHello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the 4th ODI between Sri lanka and Pakistan from the R Premadasa stadium. It is another hot day at Colombo, but we cannot predict the forecasts in this part of the world. Both teams are locked at 1-1 after rain had the final say in the 3rd ODI. However, we do have a reserve day for the remaining two games. As of now, we should have the toss in 10 minutes time.PreviewThe 4th ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which will be played out in the host nation's most successful venue, R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, should have ideally been one to watch out for. The 2 match T20 series was tied at 1-1 and both teams outplayed each other in the first two ODIs respectively. But this is when the third uninvited entity, rain, decided to make its presence felt and washed out the third ODI. The forecast for this game isn't any better, with the rain threatening a washout once again. Despite reserve days being announced for the remaining two ODIs, it remains to be seen if either of the teams will get a chance to prove their supremacy.Sri LankaThe biggest takeaway for Sri Lanka from the second ODI was all-rounder Thissara Perera's bowling performance. Till then, he had always shown glimpses of being as effective with both bat and ball. While he has continued to play those crucial finishing knocks in the death overs, the wickets column never justified his billing as a genuine all-rounder. That perception is sure to take a beating after he virtually ran through the Pakistan middle order picking up 6 wickets in the process. He completely overshadowed Tillekaratne Dilshan's composed century which was responsible for the hosts putting up a score of 280. Skipper Mahela Jayawardene's call to demote himself down the order worked as he kept the scoreboard moving after the 30 over mark. In the washed out 3rd ODI, Sri Lanka had included left arm spinner Sajeewa Weerakoon. It will be interesting to see how he uses the opportunity.PakistanThe visitors lost the second ODI by 76 runs, but at one point of time, when Azhar Ali and Misbah-Ul-Haq were batting, it looked like they would coast to victory. Ali displayed immense patience and application as he compiled a solid 96 after coming in to bat at the start of the innings. Unfortunately for his side, no other batsman put up even half a fight with Perera and the other bowlers making the most of a few bad shots. On the bowling front, Saeed Ajmal's no show and Umar Gul's indiscipline should be a cause of worry for them. Mohammad Hafeez was his usual economical self, conceding just 30 runs in 8 overs, but the side will want him to shine with the bat as well. What they said"We have to work hard in the bowling and fielding department. Sri Lanka outplayed us in all the three departments."Misbah-Ul-Haq, skipper of Pakistan"Depending on the situation and opposition we will keep changing the batting order. It is always important that one of the top order stays till the end."Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lanka captain.Teams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Sami, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Akmal, Umar Gul, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdur Rehman, Aizaz Cheema, Asad Shafiq, Azhar Ali, Imran Farhat, Rahat Ali, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Younis KhanSri Lanka (From): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Thissara Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Sachithra Senanayake, Upul Tharanga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Pradeep, Dilhara Fernando, Sajeewa WeerakoonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
