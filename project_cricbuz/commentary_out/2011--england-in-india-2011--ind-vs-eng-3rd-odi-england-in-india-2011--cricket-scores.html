Play!Teams:England (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Ravi Bopara, Jonathan Bairstow, Samit Patel, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Steven Finn, Jade DernbachIndia (Playing XI): Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Vinay Kumar, Umesh YadavDhoni: We would have bowled first. The wicket won't change much and the spinners will come into play as dew may be a factor later. It is a fresh game and we have to do everything well again. Fielding has improved a lot. There are a lot of players who started playing when the infrastructure became good, which helps their fielding. We are unchanged.Cook: It is time to deliver now, hope to do well. It is a must win game for us, but we are not looking too far. We have to do the basics well and hope for a good start. We are unchanged, we feel good balance in the side, we just haven't delivered.England have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: There is some grass on the track, and it will help the pacers. The bounce will be good and consistent, which means the ball will come on to the bat nicely. Despite the grass, this will be a 250 + pitch. England's pacers will enjoy bowling on this track, but don't forget that India have bowlers who can make use of the conditions as well. (Courtesy: Sunil Gavaskar).India 2, England 0. Hello and welcome to the coverage of the third ODI between the latest arch rivals in cricket. After having a nightmare in England, India have turned things around with 2 crushing wins and need just one more to take the series. England need to pick themselves up pretty soon, and they can't get a better chance than today to start it, as the Mohali wicket will help the seamers. Stay tuned for further updates..Preview by Vishaal LoganathanWith a 2-0 lead in their bag, a host of confident displays backing them up and the chance of exacting revenge of their humiliating defeat at England the Men in Blue will be eager to finish the series at Mohali against a battered England. IndiaBilled as the 'Revenge Series' India have gone about their work in stunning fashion, damaging England's morale to a large extent. They have also gone ahead of England in the ODI rankings and they will want to ensure they keep it that way with another win. It came as no surprise that the selectors chose to put faith in the squad and play them for the remaining ODIs. The Indians have turned in two clinical performances to upstage the English and this is no real need to tinker with the line up ahead of the crucial game. Perhaps India's biggest headache will be the form of their openers, both Ajinkya Rahane and Parthiv Patel, who impressed in England, have failed to give the hosts a solid start in the first 2 games and the team will hope the young duo click.India will be very happy with the work done by their inexperienced bowling line-up. Vinay Kumar has been the surprise package for India with the medium pacer taking 4 wickets to help India restrict England in the last game. Praveen Kumar and Umesh Yadav too have handled their responsibilities well which will please the team as well as the fans.On the batting front, India will be delighted with the form shown by the middle order - Virat Kohli, Gautam Gambhir, MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina have all had good outing with the bat in the last 2 outings and they will be hoping the top 6 are enough to do the job in the 3rd ODI.EnglandEngland on the other hand will know that they have to do everything to ensure that they come out victors in the game. Trailing 2-0, it is make or break for England if they are to dispel comments that they are not good enough in the ODI format, especially away from home. England form has taken a huge dip and they do not have one particular department to blame, their batting, bowling and fielding has been below what one has come to expect from England and they will need all three to click if they are to stop the marauding India side. Ian Bell, one of England's best players of spin will most likely be brought into the team but that will leave Alastair Cook with a tough decision of whom to leave out or how to tinker with the line up.The English bowlers are clearly struggling without James Anderson and Stuart Broad and will hope Tim Bresnan and Steven Finn pull up their socks and put in a much better show. Pitch and ConditionsAccording to the curator, the pitch will be a 'typical Mohali pitch' and will produce enough pace and bounce for the faster bowlers to trouble the batters. Dew is also likely to play a part later in the game and the team that win the toss would most likely bowl first.QuotesThe dressing room is a happy one. In England also I didn't find anything abnormal. That's the plus point of our team. The captain (Dhoni) backs everyone - Vinay KumarWe want to get them out of their comfort zones. No one likes to target India in India because of the crowds and our guys would like to do that.
