ZIMBABWE:49.6 49.6 Hafeez to B Vitori, no run, that's it. Game over and Pakistan inch closer to white-washing Zimbabwe in all formats. Still a couple of T20Is to come though. It has been a season of drubbings. Hopefully folks will get what Iam talking about. Pakistan have won 3-0 as the game ends in near darkness. The last ball was pulled, but B Vitori inside edged it onto his pad and it dribbled back to Hafeez. Hafeez has a word with the umpire and walks off.
ZIMBABWE:49.5  Hafeez to B Vitori, 2 runs, Malik at backward square leg has dropped a sitter and has a reason to smile about it. Not sure what is there to be smiling when you have dropped an easy catch. It was swung straight to him and he got both hands to it, but it went down. Pretty poor from Malik who is one of the best in the Pakistan team
ZIMBABWE:49.4  Hafeez to Utseya, 1 run, turns the straight ball from middle to leg
ZIMBABWE:49.3  Hafeez to B Vitori, 1 run, slams a ball from outside off to long offBrian Vitori, left handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:49.2  Hafeez to Jarvis, out Bowled!! As easy as it gets. Jarvis made room to cut and missed a straight ball. The ball went on to clip off and middle. Yet another cheap wicket for Hafeez. Jarvis b Hafeez 6(12) Hafeez to Jarvis, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
ZIMBABWE:49.1  Hafeez to Jarvis, 2 runs, short and wide outside off, cut away to the sweeper cover man for a coupleMohammad Hafeez [8.0-0-31-0] is back into the attackHafeez will finish off the game. The game is completely dead and the light is pretty poor
ZIMBABWE:48.6  Khan to Jarvis, 1 run, jammed straight down the ground
ZIMBABWE:48.5  Khan to Utseya, 1 run, full ball on the stumps, driven to long on
ZIMBABWE:48.4  Khan to Jarvis, 1 run, slogs a slower delivery to deep square
ZIMBABWE:48.3  Khan to Jarvis, no run, good yorker length delivery following Jarvis who digs it out
ZIMBABWE:48.2  Khan to Jarvis, no run, Jarvis is groping and floundering against the slower ones. This one is way outside off and should have been called a wide, but it isn't
ZIMBABWE:48.1  Khan to Utseya, 1 run, driven to sweeper coverSohail Khan [8.0-0-32-1] is back into the attackThis is getting boring now. Zimbabwe realistically don't have a chance to win the game and the over-rate of Pakistan has been poor. They should have ended the game 10 minutes back, but they are still 2 overs behind. Sohail to have a crack now.
ZIMBABWE:47.6  Tanvir to Utseya, 1 run, short and outside off, Utseya dabs it down to third man
ZIMBABWE:47.5  Tanvir to Jarvis, 1 run, drags a full ball from middle stump line down to backward square leg
ZIMBABWE:47.4  Tanvir to Jarvis, no run, goes back to the seam-up delivery and beats Jarvis' cut
ZIMBABWE:47.3  Tanvir to Jarvis, no run, now the slower delivery flies over middle stump. Once again Jarvis isn't picking the change of pace from Tanvir and is beaten all ends up
ZIMBABWE:47.2  Tanvir to Jarvis, no run, Jarvis is miles early into the loft and the slower delivery bounces over the off stump
ZIMBABWE:47.1  Tanvir to Utseya, 1 run, turned to YK at short mid and Utseya has to put in the hard strides to make it. He was in even as YK missed
ZIMBABWE:46.6  Aizaz Cheema to Utseya, 1 run, end of a superb spell from Aizaz Cheema who continues to impress. Full and Utseya drives down to long on to keep strike
ZIMBABWE:46.5  Aizaz Cheema to Utseya, 2 runs, What sort of a shot is that? Utseya came down the track, the short ball was heading towards the badge of his helmet, initially he aimed for the pull, but the ball hurried onto him and it flew off the outer edge over mid off. A ducking off bunt calls the commentator on air. It had even the fielders on the off side confused, who were looking in the direction of mid wicket
ZIMBABWE:46.4  Aizaz Cheema to Jarvis, 1 run, YK called into action from mid off and he nearly runs out Jarvis. If he had hit, Jarvis was miles out. Missed despite having 3 stumps to aim at
ZIMBABWE:46.3  Aizaz Cheema to Jarvis, no run, what a good first up delivery. Straight and yorker length. Jarvis somehow managed to keep it out and has a look at his bat after that.Kyle Jarvis, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:46.2  Aizaz Cheema to Price, out Bowled!! Aizaz Cheema has been the find of the tour for Pakistan. Straight and pacy. Beats Price's ambitious attempt to cut and the ball hits the side of off stump. Aizaz Cheema looks up to the heavens. Can he get 5? Price b Aizaz Cheema 10(8) [4s-1] Aizaz Cheema to Price, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
ZIMBABWE:46.1  Aizaz Cheema to Price, 2 runs, Price pulls and pulls well, but finds Malik running to his left at deep mid to cut it offA slight delay in play as the umpires are changing the ball. The light isn't getting any better. Looks quite gloomy.
ZIMBABWE:45.6  Tanvir to Utseya, 2 runs, swatted straight down the ground, for a well run couple
ZIMBABWE:45.5  Tanvir to Price, 1 run, Tanvir hurls a low full toss that catches Price on the glove. He is wringing his hand in pain. Hopefully he should be fine
ZIMBABWE:45.4  Tanvir to Price, FOUR!!, That's a good shot. Made room and carved a length ball beating the dive of Malik at cover point. That was hit hard and the ball raced away to the fence
ZIMBABWE:45.3  Tanvir to Utseya, 1 run, Utseya isn't to the pitch of the slower delivery and ends up chipping it early, but he gets it in the gap
ZIMBABWE:45.3  Tanvir to Utseya, wide, down leg, wide called
ZIMBABWE:45.2  Tanvir to Price, 1 run, another slower delivery, Price nudges it to the mid wicket region. Singles won't help at this stage
ZIMBABWE:45.1  Tanvir to Utseya, 1 run, slower delivery down the legs, Utseya taps it softly and they taken an easy single
ZIMBABWE:44.6  Aizaz Cheema to Utseya, 1 run, goes back to the short ball and Utseya hooks and finds the vacant deep square leg
ZIMBABWE:44.5  Aizaz Cheema to Price, 1 run, how can every Pakistani seamer do this - get it right up there at international level beats me. This one is tailing back in and at pace. Price's hopeful prod from the crease finds an inside edge that runs down to short mid
ZIMBABWE:44.4  Aizaz Cheema to Price, no run, full and outside off, Price drove outside the line and the ball whistled past the edge
ZIMBABWE:44.3  Aizaz Cheema to Utseya, 1 run, comical stuff from Ian Gould. He is standing next to Umar Akmal at cover point. The cut shot is coming in his direction and he has to move quickly out of the way even as Umar dives to his left and saves a couple of runs. Umar did well not to collide with Gould.
ZIMBABWE:44.2  Aizaz Cheema to Price, 1 run, tries the short one to Price who pulls it wide of mid on to get off the markRay Price, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:44.1  Aizaz Cheema to Waller, out Bowled!! Cleaned him up! Waller knew he had to go for the big hits and has failed to connect. Made room and tried to slog across the line. But the ball was too pacy and knocked out the leg stump. The leg stump presents a sorry sight. Waller b Aizaz Cheema 19(18) [4s-2] Aizaz Cheema to Waller, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
ZIMBABWE:43.6  Tanvir to Waller, 1 run, finally Tanvir produces the perfect yorker. Swerving in to off stump, Waller calmly guides it down to short third to retain strike
ZIMBABWE:43.5  Tanvir to Waller, FOUR!!, Another fab strike from Waller. It is on a length outside off and Waller went up and over cover. Beautifully struck and he will get consecutive boundaries.
ZIMBABWE:43.4  Tanvir to Waller, FOUR!!, Top stuff from Waller. It was a foot short of being a yorker and he cashed in. Made room slightly, opened the face and drove it past the couple of men in the backward point region
ZIMBABWE:43.3  Tanvir to Waller, no run, how did that miss leg stump? Full and down leg, Waller tried to drive down the ground after making room, but the ball sneaks past his bat and hits the pad before Adnan makes a good stop to his right. He was wrong-footed, but recovered well
ZIMBABWE:43.2  Tanvir to Utseya, 1 run, this one jumps off a length, Utseya does well to drop with soft hands in front of point to take a quick single
ZIMBABWE:43.1  Tanvir to Waller, 1 run, a bit of van der Merwe in that from Waller. Closes his eyes and tries to swing to leg, but is fooled by the slower delivery, the lame shot runs down to long on
ZIMBABWE:42.6  Aizaz Cheema to Utseya, no run, good short delivery. Lifting outside off, Utseya lets it go
ZIMBABWE:42.5  Aizaz Cheema to Waller, 1 run, now does the reverse, moves to off and tries to go over mid wicket. But the length is too full and Waller edges his hoick onto his boot
ZIMBABWE:42.4  Aizaz Cheema to Waller, no run, Aizaz Cheema follows Waller who was making room to go over the off side field, Waller swings and missesProsper Utseya, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:42.3  Aizaz Cheema to Chigumbura, out Caught by Shafiq at long on!! An epic jinx and that's the end of Chigu. Tried to take on the short ball, but couldn't keep the pull down, Shafiq moved to his right and held on comfortably. Could be the difference between a consolation win and a white-wash. Chigumbura c Shafiq b Aizaz Cheema 9(15) [4s-1] Aizaz Cheema to Chigumbura, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:42.2  Aizaz Cheema to Chigumbura, FOUR!!, bad ball and with all up on the off side its a pretty poor delivery. Short and wide outside off, Chigumbura went hard and over backward point. Easily done by Chigumbura - who has to be there till the end, if his side are to make a match of this
ZIMBABWE:42.1  Aizaz Cheema to Waller, 1 run, short of length delivery down leg, Waller helps a swat down to fine legAizaz Cheema [7.0-1-27-1] is back into the attackZim have taken the batting PP. A fresh pair of gloves come out for the batsmen. Cheema comes on. He is good at the death. Has the ability to bowl right up there. All are up on the off side. Fine leg is back and the rest are on the on side fence too.
ZIMBABWE:41.6  Tanvir to Chigumbura, no run, Chigumbura didn't know much about that well disguised slower delivery from Tanvir. In the end his ungainly grope from the crease meets thin air as the ball passes past his bat. Not far from the off stump either
ZIMBABWE:41.5  Tanvir to Waller, 1 run, deliberately angles the bat and guides it down to third man
ZIMBABWE:41.4  Tanvir to Waller, 2 runs, full and wide outside off, Waller gets forward to lace a cover drive down to sweeper cover for an easy couple
ZIMBABWE:41.4  Tanvir to Waller, wide, good short ball, but its marginally outside leg and the umpires are pretty harsh on those. Waller didn't connect with the pull too
ZIMBABWE:41.3  Tanvir to Chigumbura, 1 run, that's where he is good. Short and wide outside off. Cut away hard down to sweeper cover
ZIMBABWE:41.2  Tanvir to Chigumbura, no run, Chigumbura tries to be cute, but his attempted steer to a short of length delivery that is angling in, misses and doesn't make contact
ZIMBABWE:41.1  Tanvir to Waller, 1 run, Tanvir starts from round the wicket and Waller works it with the angle down to square leg region. It is that man - YK again - running after it and sliding to cut off the possibility of a secondSohail Tanvir [5.0-0-23-0] is back into the attack
ZIMBABWE:40.6  Khan to Chigumbura, no run, this innings is going nowhere. The asking rate is rising and that over wouldn't have helped at all. Punched back to the bowler who goes to his right to stop
ZIMBABWE:40.5  Khan to Chigumbura, no run, good short ball - an effort ball. Chigumbura lets it go as it is outside off. One short ball signalled for the over
ZIMBABWE:40.4  Khan to Chigumbura, no run, now bowls the slower delivery on the stumps, Chigumbura waits for it and keeps it out
ZIMBABWE:40.3  Khan to Chigumbura, no run, short of length delivery outside off, Chigumbura defends from the crease to backward point
ZIMBABWE:40.2  Khan to Waller, 1 run, that shows how unpredictable the Pakistan side is. On the one hand we have the veteran YK who is brilliant on the field. On the other Hafeez at point lets go of a regulation stop - conceding a single. He went to his right, but didn't bend down to stop it
ZIMBABWE:40.1  Khan to Chigumbura, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, cut down to third man
ZIMBABWE:39.6  Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, 1 run, flat and short outside off, Chigumbura cuts hard and straight to the fielder at sweeper cover
ZIMBABWE:39.5  Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, no run, gets forward and defends
ZIMBABWE:39.4  Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, 2 runs, once again it is YK who is called into action. If Yasir Shah had collected it, Waller would have been gone. It was a risky 2nd and Waller was struggling, but Yasir Shah couldn't collect a wide throw from YK who charged at the ball from deep mid wicket
ZIMBABWE:39.3  Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, no run, well tossed up outside off, driven crisply, but finds cover
ZIMBABWE:39.2  Yasir Shah to Waller, 1 run, gets the bat in front of the bat to get it wide of cover
ZIMBABWE:39.1  Yasir Shah to Waller, no run, short and skidding on, Waller goes on the backfoot and defends it back to Yasir Shah
ZIMBABWE:38.6  Khan to Chigumbura, no run, full delivery on off stump, driven straight to the fielder at coverElton Chigumbura, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:38.5  Khan to Masakadza, out Caught by Misbah-ul-Haq!! The Zimbaweans are imploding here. All because of their own fault. Nothing great with that delivery. It was the slower short delivery on off stump. Sat up to be pulled and Masakadza found Misbah at mid wicket with a lame pull. No power or any elevation on that shot and Khan has his first ODI wicket. He sports a smile too. Masakadza c Misbah-ul-Haq b Khan 21(26) [6s-1] Khan to Masakadza, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:38.4  Khan to Waller, 1 run, opens the face of the bat and gently guides it down to third man to get off the mark
ZIMBABWE:38.3  Khan to Waller, no run, fuller length delivery outside off, Waller plays an open faced defence to backward point
ZIMBABWE:38.2  Khan to Waller, no run, short and wide outside off, Waller doesn't make contact with the upper cut. He was trying to dab that actually and was nowhere close to it
ZIMBABWE:38.1  Khan to Masakadza, 1 run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Masakadza backs away and cuts hard, finds sweeper cover
ZIMBABWE:37.6  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, 1 run, short arm pulled from outside off to long onMalcolm Waller, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:37.5  Yasir Shah to Taibu, out Caught by Younis Khan!! Magnifico from Younis! What an all-round fielder that man is. He always has a cheerful visage, but boy isn't he one of the best in this ordinary Pakistan fielding side. Taibu would feel disappointed that he found YK. It was short and Taibu pulled, YK running to his right from deep mid kept his eyes on the ball and then lunged out with a dive at the opportune moment to grab it with both hands. It was dying on him and he got the dive right superbly. Takes it and gets up in one motion too. He always wears a watch on his left hand. Wonder whether they are any scratches on that or not. But that could be a game winning catch. Taibu c Younis Khan b Yasir Shah 27(26) [4s-2 6s-1] Yasir Shah to Taibu, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:37.4  Yasir Shah to Taibu, no run, makes room and cuts, but finds backward point
ZIMBABWE:37.3  Yasir Shah to Taibu, FOUR!!, Rameez reminds us of the absence of Ravi Shaz by calling that a tracer bullet. Taibu skipped down the track and belted that flat and hard, wide of long off, the fielder had no chance. It was sensationally struck by Taibu too.
ZIMBABWE:37.2  Yasir Shah to Taibu, no run, fired in down leg, Taibu misses the flick, was going down for sure
ZIMBABWE:37.1  Yasir Shah to Taibu, no run, comes down the track and has to defend it back to Yasir Shah as he isn't to the pitch
ZIMBABWE:36.6  Khan to Taibu, 1 run, drops it in front of his feet and Masakadza responds. Easily done in the end
ZIMBABWE:36.5  Khan to Masakadza, 1 run, Adnan's screeching confused the batsmen there - who were looking to run a couple. Adnan shouted keeper keeper and though the 2nd was on, the batsmen declined to take the risk. Ah - the Akmals and their screeching. Never get tired of it!
ZIMBABWE:36.4  Khan to Masakadza, no run, back of a length delivery on the stumps, Masakadza nudges the ball towards short mid - there is no chance of a run there
ZIMBABWE:36.3  Khan to Masakadza, no run, short of length delivery outside off, punched to that man - cover again
ZIMBABWE:36.2  Khan to Masakadza, no run, short and wide outside off, Masakadza wants to do an encore, but reaches out and mistimes the attempted cut straight to the fielder at cover
ZIMBABWE:36.1  Khan to Masakadza, SIX!!, Masakali has become Sehwag for an instant and sends this upper cut over deep point. A friendly short ball outside off, a loosener from Khan to start off and that has been punished. Masakadza arched back and got under it, before that fierce upper cut landed beyond the ropes. He timed the pants off it. A good start to the over for ZimbabweSohail Khan [5.0-0-20-0] is back into the attack
ZIMBABWE:35.6  Yasir Shah to Taibu, 2 runs, Adnan to Yasir Shah just before this ball - 'Yasir sochke bowl isko' [Yasir think and bowl to Taibu]. Yasir Shah drags this short and Taibu pulls it wide of long on for a couple
ZIMBABWE:35.5  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, 1 run, gets off strike with a miscued pull down to long on
ZIMBABWE:35.4  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, no run, the pressure is getting to Masakadza who finds cover again
ZIMBABWE:35.3  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, no run, and again. And what on earth was that appeal for? Masakadza repeated his previous stroke, off the previous delivery and was hit on the pad. He was miles down the wicket and the umpire rightly negated the appeal
ZIMBABWE:35.2  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, no run, now comes down the track and tries to waft across the line to a straight ball on the stumps, misses
ZIMBABWE:35.1  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, no run, flat and skidding on, punched straight to the fielder at cover
ZIMBABWE:34.6  Malik to Taibu, FOUR!!, Taibu has pulled off another stunning shot. It was full and on the stumps, Taibu in one fluid motion - swivelled and then sent it with a half flick/half smear. The ball went to the right of deep square and beat him easily. The loopy friendly stuff of Malik being taken to the cleaners by Zimbabwe
ZIMBABWE:34.5  Malik to Masakadza, 1 run, swept hard, but straight to the fielder at deep backward square leg
ZIMBABWE:34.4  Malik to Taibu, 1 run, tries to repeat the stroke, but ends up pulling it down to deep square
ZIMBABWE:34.3  Malik to Taibu, SIX!!, now the dimunitive Taibu takes on Malik and makes it count. Comes down the track and hoicks it across the line. Gets enough on it to clear deep mid wicket. A much needed boundary six for Taibu and Zim. They were under the cosh, but that strike should ease the pressure a tad.
ZIMBABWE:34.2  Malik to Masakadza, 1 run, plays with the turn and gets it wide of square leg
ZIMBABWE:34.1  Malik to Masakadza, 2 runs, short and flat outside off, Masakadza punches it wide of long off and an easy couple is on the offering
ZIMBABWE:33.6  Yasir Shah to Taibu, no run, well tossed up delivery on the stumps, Taibu lunges forward in defence
ZIMBABWE:33.5  Yasir Shah to Taibu, no run, rocks back and punches it straight to the fielder at cover
ZIMBABWE:33.4  Yasir Shah to Taibu, no run, pushed through quicker, Taibu defends from the crease
ZIMBABWE:33.3  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, 1 run, Masakadza again isn't to the pitch of the ball, but manages to nudge it down to square leg
ZIMBABWE:33.2  Yasir Shah to Taibu, 1 run, gets forward and drives on the up to sweeper cover
ZIMBABWE:33.1  Yasir Shah to Taibu, no run, Taibu opens the face of the bat and his steer finds short third
ZIMBABWE:32.6  Malik to Taibu, 1 run, uses his feet and bunts it down to long on
ZIMBABWE:32.5  Malik to Masakadza, 1 run, pushes down the track and pats it down to long on
ZIMBABWE:32.4  Malik to Masakadza, no run, that stopped on Masakadza who closed his face quite early, the ball fell way in front of Malik who made no effort to go forward and catch it
ZIMBABWE:32.3  Malik to Taibu, 1 run, makes room and steers a turning delivery, down to short third
ZIMBABWE:32.2  Malik to Taibu, no run, now misses the hard sweep to a ball well down leg
ZIMBABWE:32.1  Malik to Taibu, no run, was there any bat on it? No is the answer. Taibu looked to improvise and tried his favorite reverse paddle sweep. The ball bounced a tad extra and hit his left shoulder, fell safely and in front of a charging short fineDrinks are on the field now. Zimbabwe need 130 off 108 balls with a batting powerplay in hand. They would fancy themselves since Pakistan aren't playing Junaid and Ajmal today - two of their best death bowlers and arguably the best in the world. But they need a stand to get them closer, before a finisher like Chigu can do his job.
ZIMBABWE:31.6  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, no run, Masakadza isn't to the pitch and taps it straight to the fielder at cover
ZIMBABWE:31.5  Yasir Shah to Taibu, 1 run, angles the bat and drives on the up wide of backward point
ZIMBABWE:31.4  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, 1 run, short and flat outside off, cut away to sweeper cover
ZIMBABWE:31.3  Yasir Shah to Taibu, 1 run, skidding onto middle and leg, Taibu whips this through square leg
ZIMBABWE:31.2  Yasir Shah to Taibu, 2 runs, reverse swept down past short fine for a couple. More of a reverse paddle actually
ZIMBABWE:31.1  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, 1 run, flat and skidding on, Masakadza punches it off the backfoot down to long on
ZIMBABWE:30.6  Malik to Taibu, 2 runs, deliberately chipped over mid wicket for a couple
ZIMBABWE:30.5  Malik to Taibu, no run, defends it back to Malik
ZIMBABWE:30.4  Malik to Taibu, no run, Malik is gutted. He kept on appealing and is still appealing. But that was a good decision from Tiffin. Taibu missed the regulation off break, but made sure he got outside the line. Malik appealed up and down, he was within shaking distance of Taibu. But Tiffin got it spot on. Though it was hitting Taibu in front of the stumps, he made sure he got outside the line.
ZIMBABWE:30.3  Malik to Taibu, no run, nudged to leg, there isn't a quick single on offerTatenda Taibu, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:30.2  Malik to Chibhabha, out Caught by Younis Khan!! Mirza Malik strikes and Sania would approve of that huge smile! A soft dismissal in the end really. Chibhabha looked to go inside out and just ended up slicing a simple catch to cover. Younis won't drop those and a significant contribution from Chibhabha has come to an end. He needed to kick on, but has fallen in the effort to up the tempo. Chibhabha c Younis Khan b Malik 62(88) [4s-7] Malik to Chibhabha, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:30.1  Malik to Masakadza, 1 run, flatter delivery on the middle and leg, worked wide of mid wicketShoaib Malik, right-arm off break, comes into the attackShoaib Malik - more famous now for being married to Sania Mirza comes on. A pretty defensive field in place for him.
ZIMBABWE:29.6  Yasir Shah to Chibhabha, FOUR!!, now Chibhabha is timing the ball well. He may have started off slowly, but is turning it on now. Kneels down and slog sweeps a flighted delivery outside off to the deep mid wicket fence, one bounce over the ropes. The kind of over that the Zimbabweans needed as they were falling behind the rate. That over should keep them in the hunt.
ZIMBABWE:29.5  Yasir Shah to Chibhabha, 2 runs, shortens the length by going back and pulling just over and to the left of mid wicket, good fielding from Umar Akmal prevents the boundary
ZIMBABWE:29.4  Yasir Shah to Chibhabha, no run, fires it down leg and Chibhabha couldn't whip it away
ZIMBABWE:29.3  Yasir Shah to Chibhabha, FOUR!!, Supreme from Chibhabha! Now and then he unleashes a corker. This is one. Comes down the track and then flat bats it on the up over cover. The ball went to the fence like a Ravi Shaz tracer bullet!
ZIMBABWE:29.2  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, 1 run, again chips down the wicket and clips a straight ball to the square leg region
ZIMBABWE:29.1  Yasir Shah to Masakadza, no run, Masakadza comes down the track and isn't to the pitch of the ball, so has to pad it away
ZIMBABWE:28.6  Aizaz Cheema to Chibhabha, no run, that's a top over from Aizaz Cheema. Short and rising, Chibhabha backed away, but the ball flew past his nose as he backed out of the upper cut at the last moment
ZIMBABWE:28.5  Aizaz Cheema to Chibhabha, no run, Chibhabha comes down the track and simultaneously makes room, but he can only punch it to cover as the ball follows him - good bowling from Aizaz Cheema again
ZIMBABWE:28.4  Aizaz Cheema to Masakadza, 1 run, gets off the mark with a soft tap off the ribs down to short mid wicketHamilton Masakadza, right handed bat, comes to the creaseA slip in place for Masakali. That's good captaincy from Misbah.
ZIMBABWE:28.3  Aizaz Cheema to Taylor, out Caught by Adnan Akmal!! The persistence of Aizaz Cheema has been rewarded. Taylor tried to manufacture a shot from nothing there and perished. It was a short of length delivery that was seaming back in, there wasn't much room to steer or to cut. Taylor did both - arching back and trying to get it down to third man. A soft nick settles in Adnan's mitts and Pakistan have struck again. Taylor c Adnan Akmal b Aizaz Cheema 6(14) Aizaz Cheema to Taylor, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:28.2  Aizaz Cheema to Taylor, no run, Aizaz Cheema isn't doing anything extraordinary - just keeping it straight on the stumps, Taylor defends again
ZIMBABWE:28.1  Aizaz Cheema to Chibhabha, 1 run, another quick single taken, but it is an easy one in the end. Backs away and punches a short of length delivery on leg stump down to mid off. The call is early and they make it easily in the end
ZIMBABWE:27.6  Yasir Shah to Taylor, no run, a highly optimistic shout that from Yasir Shah. It was fired in down leg and though Taylor missed the pull, he was never in danger of being ruled LBW.
ZIMBABWE:27.5  Yasir Shah to Taylor, no run, flat delivery on the stumps, defended back to Yasir Shah
ZIMBABWE:27.4  Yasir Shah to Chibhabha, 1 run, chips down and flicks through mid wicket
ZIMBABWE:27.3  Yasir Shah to Taylor, 1 run, Sohail Khan did well to account for the spin and save some runs. It was swept hard to his right at deep backward square and he did well even as the ball was spinning away from him
ZIMBABWE:27.2  Yasir Shah to Taylor, 2 runs, comes down the track and miscues a lofted hit straight down the ground. They push and come back for the second
ZIMBABWE:27.1  Yasir Shah to Chibhabha, 1 run, punched to long off and that brings up Chibhabha's 9th ODI fifty. A solid yet slow innings from the sturdy Zimbabwean opener. He acknowledges the cheers from the sparse crowd
ZIMBABWE:26.6  Aizaz Cheema to Taylor, no run, that's a top top over. A maiden as Taylor's forceful cut goes without any timing to Hafeez
ZIMBABWE:26.5  Aizaz Cheema to Taylor, no run, Aizaz Cheema is giving nothing away, stump to stump line and Taylor defends

Join us in a while to find out..Shafiq: We are just looking to bat on. We have put on a decent total on the board. We could have made around 290 but this is a good enough total.
