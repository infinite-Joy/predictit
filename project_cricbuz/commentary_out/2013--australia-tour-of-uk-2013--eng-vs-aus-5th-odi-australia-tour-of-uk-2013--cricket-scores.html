It was a good win but its another day and couple of players coming in hopefully we continue the way we played in the last match"Clarke: "We are going to have a bat. Looked good on television (the 156 by Finch in T20) and hopefully it will play the same. I think I can play here and perform when asked about his fitness. It has been a good summer off the field but we have to win this and take something out of this series. Hughes and Fawad Ahmed come in for Marsh and Coulter-Nile"Australia have won the toss and have opted to bat13:38 Local Time: The covers are off and the sun is out. We are almost ready for the toss.13:32 Local Time: The toss has been delayed as a shower blows through and the captains who were heading for the toss are getting back in. The covers are coming on.Hello and welcome to the final international match of the English summer. The series is level at 1-1 and this will be the decider. England carry the moment with them, after they won the last match and drew the series. Morgan has lead them from the front by getting runs in crucial stages. Buttler has been impressive in both matches, by scoring fifties in both. For Australia, Clarke will be a doubtful starter for this ODI, as he has a back problem. The Aussie top order batsmen have to give a good start, so that the likes of Bailey, Voges and Wade can finish the innings well. Join us for the toss in a few minutes.Teams:England (From): Eoin Morgan(c), Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Michael Carberry, Steven Finn, Boyd Rankin, Chris Jordan, Jamie Overton, Kevin Pietersen, Ben Stokes, James Tredwell, Luke Wright, Joe Root, Jonathan TrottAustralia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Matthew Wade(w), George Bailey, Nathan Coulter-Nile, James Faulkner, Fawad Ahmed, Aaron Finch, Josh Hazlewood, Phillip Hughes, Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges, Shane WatsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
