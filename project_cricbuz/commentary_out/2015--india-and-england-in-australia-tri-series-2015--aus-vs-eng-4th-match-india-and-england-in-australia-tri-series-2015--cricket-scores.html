The bowlers struggled against England's top-order but made up with some sensational bowling towards the end. Starc and Faulkner were the key and they were well supported by Sandhu. England have got the runs on the board but the Australians, despite missing Warner and Watson, will back themselves to chase the score down. Join us in a while for the chase..Australia will be pretty chuffed with their effort in the last 10 overs. England just added 59 runs and lost 6 wickets in the process.

Ravi Bopara struggled against some disciplined death over bowling from Starc and Faulkner. Jos Buttler lost his fluency as well and England might feel they have ended up at least 25 short of a challenging score.4

ENGLAND:0.1 Starc to Moeen Ali, no run, length delivery to start off, wide of off, Ali opens the face of the bat and helps it behind pointMoeen Ali and Bell are at the crease. Moeen Ali is on strike. Starc will open the attackThe Australian players are taking their places on the field. Moeen Ali and Ian Bell have walked out to the middle. Mitchell Starc to start off. Two slips to assist him...Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Cameron White, Shaun Marsh, Steven Smith(c), Glenn Maxwell, Moises Henriques, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Gurinder SandhuEngland (Playing XI): Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Steven FinnEoin Morgan: "The pitch is looking good. Don't think it will change much so we are not too concerned about having to bat first. We have the capability to chase down scores as well. The guys are in a good place at the moment and they are looking to improve. Hopefully, we can grab a bit of momentum and perform like the previous game. Yeah, Mitchell Starc is a threat, he is an excellent bowler."Steven Smith: "We will bowl first. There is a little bit of moisture in the wicket so we will try to use it. It was disappointing for George (Bailey) not to play in front of his home crowd but we are not too worried. We have the same bowling attack. Shaun Marsh, Cameron White and Moises Henriques come in."Australia have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe news from the Australian camp is that Moises Henriques will be replacing an injured Shane Watson. England are unchanged.Meanwhile, England have a firing James Anderson and back to form Steven Finn. The four-man pace attack did an excellent job against India. However, it will have to be seen whether England will go in with the same combination. The batting looks good with Ian Bell and James Taylor helping themselves to fifties in the previous game and Eoin Morgan scoring a hundred in the first game. Nonetheless, can they stop a fiery Mitchell Starc? Hello and welcome to the fourth ODI of the tri-series, being played at the Bellerive Oval. Stay tuned as the toss and teams are not far away...Steven Smith will lead Australia in Bailey's absence. Shaun Marsh and Cameron White have been drafted into the 15-member squad. The latter is back in the ODI side after a span of more than three years. It looks most likely that Marsh and White will get a game. Australia may go in with an extra bowler and push James Faulkner up the order.England's huge win against India should boost their morale as they take on an Australian side that is without three key players. George Bailey has been handed suspension due to a slow over rate against India at Melbourne. David Warner who scored a belligerent 127 when these two teams met for the first time in the series has been rested with a hamstring scare. Shane Watson, on the other hand, was a late back-out as he complained of hamstring tightness during training.PreviewThe equation for Australia at Hobart's Bellerive Oval on Friday is simple: Win and secure a spot in the Carlton Mid Tri-Series final on February 1. For England, coming off a massive win over India, the challenge is to repeat that against the team that beat them with three wickets and 61 balls remaining in the series opener last week. Australia have bossed England in limited-overs cricket in recent years, but without three first-choice players for game four of the competition they will need to play harder to beat England. With two wins out of two, Australia lead the points table with nine while England are second after taking a bonus point from a nine-wicket thrashing of India at the Gabba earlier in the week. That win was their biggest win in terms of balls remaining (135) in the ODI format and Eoin Morgan will hope it proves a catalyst for a turnaround in fortunes after a chastising 2014.Considering the ease with which England bowled out India 153 in 39.3 overs, with Steven Finn and James Anderson sharing nine wickets, and then chased down the target in 27.3 overs, there is no need to tinker the team. Australia will be without captain George Bailey, who is serving a one-match suspension for poor over-rate against India, David Warner and Shane Watson. Shaun Marsh will fill in for Warner at the top while Bailey's absence has created an ODI opportunity for batsman Cameron White after nearly four years, and the Victorian comes into the match with good limited-overs form this season. The pair now has the chance to stake their claim for a last-minute inclusion to Australia's ICC World Cup squad should Michael Clarke fail to meet the February 21 deadline to recover from a hamstring injury.Watson's latest injury means that the management will likely slot in an extra bowler and bump James Faulkner up a spot to No 7. Steven Smith will captain in place of Bailey - the first time he has got the chance in ODIs - and will be key to the batting prospects. Australia have lost one ODI in Hobart in the last five and half years, to India in 2012.
