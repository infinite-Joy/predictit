The captain who wins the toss today will want to bowl first.Hello and Welcome to the match between South Africa and Netherlands. South Africa will be looking to continue their domination, while the Dutch will be seeking inspiration from Ireland and cause a major upset.By Karthik LakshmananThe World Cup is well into its 2nd week and there hasn't been an upset yet. None of the minnows have been able to trouble the big teams and prove the ICC (which had earlier reduced the number of teams in the upcoming World Cups) wrong. Forget winning, barring Netherlands against England and Ireland against Bangladesh, none of the associate members have even come close to competing against the major nations. An upset seems unlikely as Netherlands take on South Africa, but cricket isn't called a funny game without a reason.Team NewsSouth Africa: South Africa have done everything right ever since they landed in India. Victories against Zimbabwe and Australia in the warm ups were followed by a comfortable outing against the West Indies. The batting, bowling and needless to say, fielding have all looked almost perfect. The return of Kallis has given stability to the side and allows them to play an extra spinner. Hashim Amla, Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis have got off to starts since the practice games started and would be looking to make big ones against Netherlands to warm up for bigger contests ahead. The middle order looks solid in the form of AB de Villers(who opened his World Cup campaign with a won against West Indies), and JP Duminy. The problem for the Proteas comes after that, as they carry a long and inexperienced lower middle order.
Quite surprisingly, spinners have dominated South Africa's bowling attack so far in the tournament. Robin Peterson, Johan Botha and Imran Tahir have all chipped in with wickets in their tour. South Africa surprised everyone by playing all the 3 spinners and even opened with Botha in their game against the West Indies. Imran Tahir, the Pakistan born leg spinner, made a memorable debut by picking 4 wickets and would look forward to settle his spot in the playing eleven. The Mohali wicket offers more pace than other Indian tracks and Lonwabo Tsotsobe may come in for Robin Peterson. South Africa had a few minor injuries to worry about during the week - Steyn (side), JP Duminy (back) and Tahir (throat infection) - but all three have recovered and are expected to play.Netherlands: Netherlands have put on contrasting performances in their 2 games so far. ten Doeschate's spirited century and useful contributions from the middle order helped them post 292 against England in their opening game. England did manage to survive the scare, but the Oranje has made a statement - that they can compete. High on confidence, they took on Windies in their next game, but played like true minnows. The bowlers struggled against the West Indies top order, and were ruthlessly punished by Pollard who blasted away to 60 in just 27 balls. But even amidst the carnage, Pieter Seelar, the slow left arm spinner, impressed. When every bowler went for atleast 6 runs an over, Seelar returned with impressive figures of 10-1-45-3. The batsmen, who put up a brave fight against England, had no clue to Kemar Roach's quick bowling in the next game, and would have to find answers pretty soon if they are to compete against the likes of Steyn and Morkel on a faster track.Head to headThe 2 teams have met twice before, and South Africa have completed huge victories both times - a 160 run win in the 1996 World Cup and a 221-run margin in the 2007 edition.Quotes"It is very difficult coming into a competition to play Full-member teams when we haven't for a long while. The same countries that say we shouldn't be at World Cups are the same ones that don't play us between World Cups and that's difficult." Netherlands captain Peter Borren."It won't be an easy game."
