Two slips in place for McKay.Phil Hughes has been the cornerstone of this Australian batting effort. He walked in early at the fall of David Warner, saw Wade fall as well, was lucky that the stumps and the bails were intact even as one of his inside edges crashed onto it. Inbetween he stitched together useful stands with Bailey and Hussey before expoding towards the end. Australia will be happy with this total, on a pitch that looks two paced while the visitors will fancy a chase. Join us in 40 minutes time for the resumption.4

We are set for the final ODI here at the Blundstone Arena.Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews, Kushal Janith Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Rangana HerathAustralia (Playing XI): Phillip Hughes, David Warner, George Bailey(c), David Hussey, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), Moises Henriques, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Clint McKay, Xavier DohertyGlen Maxwell has replaced the injured Michael Clarke for Australia.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to fieldHello and welcome everyone. Big day ahead for both teams. Sri Lanka are in with a chance to become the first team ever to win more than one bilateral series in Australia. The hosts will not be willing to give it up so easily. They will be wanting to square the series. Michael Clarke is injured and will not be taking part in this crucial tie. George Bailey will be leading in his absence. The toss and other team updates coming up shortly.PreviewWith a washout at Sydney and a couple of loses already in the 5-match ODI series, hosts Australia go into the final game v Sri Lanka at Hobart, not just desperately to win, but also to avoid another humiliating moment in the cricketing history. After all, a Sri Lankan win will mean that the Emerald Isles will be the first team to win two bilateral series down under. The Australian top-order has been under constant threat in recent times and often has led to the side's downfall, leaving the lower-middle too much to do. George Bailey, with 137 runs in four innings, has scored the most number of runs among the Aussies and with David Warner getting into form straight away with a 60 at the SCG, both need to fire all guns blazing and also hope for a collective effort from the rest of their pals. The bowling department though has not been a big worry with Clint McKay and Mitchell Johnson amongst the wickets alongside a promising Mitchell Starc. On the other hand, Sri Lanka just need to continue their good work, especially with the ball. Nuwan Kulasekara, has been near unplayable throughout the series with his sharp in-swingers and quite understandably is the leading wicket-taker in the series with ten Aussie scalps. Lasith Slinga-Malinga runs him close with a wicket less, and the deadly combo is well backed up by Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera. The Lankan batsmen have not had to workout long in the middle, thanks to their over-working bowling unit. Australia: The Australian side is already under pressure even before the toss at the Bellerive Oval as skipper Michael Clarke is a doubtful starter after suffering an ankle sprain during the team's practice session on Tuesday. This would add immense pressure on George Bailey, who is likely to lead the side in Clarke's absence, and with an already out-of-form batting unit, the quality of Clarke will certainly be missed. The team management is in no hurry to take a call, giving Clarke enough time to recover and have added that he will take the field if his fitness is proven. Should Clarke be sidelined, it is likely that Glenn Maxwell will team-up with Moises Henriques as the second all-rounder in the side. Sri Lanka: Wednesday will be an important day in the history of Sri Lankan cricket as skipper Mahela Jayawardene will be seen walking out for a toss for the last time in his career. He is not expected to make changes to the side in his 145th limited-overs international as the side has been fairing well. The inclusion of Dinesh Chandimal as a wicket-keeper batsman and Kushal Perera playing as a specialist batsman in the side is likely to remain while Rangana Herath is expected to roll the arms over ahead of Ajantha Mendis. Wrecker-in-chief for bundling Australia to their lowest ever ODI team total a few days ago, all eyes will be on Nuwan Kulasekara when he takes the new ball on a wicket that is presumed to play as a decent batting strip. On the whole, the Islanders would be keen to repeat their show in a place where they have sweet memories against Australia in 1999 and 2012. Stats: * Opening batsman Tillakaratne Dlishan needs just 13 more runs to get to 7000 ODI runs. * Four more wickets to Nuwan Kulasekara will take him to the 150 ODI scalps.Teams:Australia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Matthew Wade(w), George Bailey, Jackson Bird, Ben Cutting, Xavier Doherty, Moises Henriques, Phillip Hughes, David Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Starc, David WarnerSri Lanka (From): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Kushal Janith Perera(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Shaminda Eranga, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Kulasekara, Angelo Mathews, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Akila Dananjaya Perera, Upul Tharanga, Ajantha MendisLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
