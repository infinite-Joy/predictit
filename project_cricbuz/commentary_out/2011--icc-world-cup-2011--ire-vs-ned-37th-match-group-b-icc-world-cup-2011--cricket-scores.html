Bukhari will open the attackPorterfield will be cursing his decision to field first on this flat wicket. Ryan ten Doeschate made hay as he carted the Ireland bowlers to all parts of the Eden Gardens. He has been the one man show for the Men in Orange in this World Cup and he stamped his class with a brilliant century, his 5th in ODIs. He was joined by Borren and they increased their scoring rate after a relatively slow start. Ireland bled a lot of runs in the Batting PP as they conceded 39 runs in five overs. After the fall of Doeschate, Borren carried on the good work with some innovative stroke-play and propelled the Netherlands to 306. The last over bowled by Kevin O Brien featured four consecutive run-outs as Ireland finished the innings on a high. The Men in Green have a huge task ahead of them. However, they will back themselves to chase this down. Will the Netherlands score their first victory in this competition? Join us in a short while for the run-chase.4

We are slightly disappointed that we did not win some close games but we are improving. We have played some good, consistent cricket and we would be looking for a win.Ireland have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report: Slightly overcast conditions in Kolkata and there is a light breeze blowing.

There will be some help for the spinners and some help early on for the seamers. The team that wins the toss will want to bat first.Hello and Welcome to the game between Ireland and the Netherlands at the Eden Gardens, Kolkata. This is a chance for both teams to end their tournament on a high. Ireland have given us some memorable moments in this World Cup and they will want to show that they are higher than the other associates. Netherlands, on the other hand, have faded away after their great first game against England. They will want to register a win and end the tournament with their heads held high. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.The preview by Gokul GopalBefore they bid a final farewell, both Ireland and Netherlands would be hoping to end their World Cup campaign on a positive note. While both sides are out of contention for a berth in the knock-outs, Ireland can boast of having secured two points after their shocking win against England. The Dutch, on the other hand, are yet to open their account after suffering five consecutive losses.Head to Head: Ireland and Netherlands have faced each other on 7 occasions. The Dutch have lost 5 times while ending up victorious only once. One game yielded no results. The game in Eden Gardens would be the first time that these two sides play against each other in a World Cup.Ireland: Although the Irish would be heading back home after the game against Netherlands, they have a lot of positives to take back. Amongst the minnows from both groups, Ireland are by far the best during this World Cup. Their biggest moment of the tournament came when they pulled off an upset win against England in a high-scoring encounter in Bangalore and the star was Kevin O' Brien, who hit the fastest hundred in all World Cups. Ireland could have had a couple of more wins, but fell agonizingly short of that in the games against Bangladesh and West Indies. Even in the matches against the tournament favourites such as South Africa and India, Ireland showed that had the sting in them to trouble the bigger sides. Ireland, having proved that they are not a side to be taken lightly, go into their final game of the tournament as the favourites.Netherlands: The Dutch, despite not securing a single win so far, have been impressive in some parts of the tournament. Like the Irish, Holland's best moment of the World Cup also came against the English. ICC's associate player in 2008 and 2010, Ryan ten Doeschate was the thorn for England in their opening game. Doeschate cracked a 110-ball 119 to help Netherlands set a challenging target of 293, which England did manage to chase down, but not without a lot of hiccups. Doeschate also scored an unbeaten half-century against Bangladesh, despite the other players failing to provide him support. Netherlands put up a fighting performance against India, but failed to impress and were blown away in the matches against West Indies and South Africa. As they get ready to pack up their bags, the Dutch would look to at least go back home with 2 points under their belt.Pitch and Ground Conditions:After the hiatus at Eden Gardens, which saw the India-England match moved to Bangalore, the historic ground hosted its first World Cup game of this edition when South Africa faced off against the Irish. The pitch, as seen in that game, was a batting friendly track and the same can be expected for the Ireland-Netherlands match. Clear skies and sunny conditions are predicted for the day and one can expect a high-scoring game in this inconsequential tie between the minnows.Quotes:"We've done a lot of good things in this World Cup. We've gained experience and will be taking back a lot from this tournament. We have been in several winning positions. Beating England was the highlight of the World Cup for us. Our bowling and fielding have been right up there with anyone. We were right in the game against the West Indies and should have won the match against Bangladesh: William Porterfield, speaking about Ireland's performance in the World Cup
It was pretty special for me. Personally, it is about as close to a perfect innings as I want to play in one-day cricket.
