He's elated, takes the helmet off and shouts "woo hoo" before raising his bat. The Zimbabwean dressing room stands and applauds. This has been an incredible knock, but there is still work to be done though.

ZIMBABWE:44.6 Nathan McCullum to Chigumbura, out Caught by Guptill!! Guptill makes no mistake this time. Flighted delivery cramping Chigumbura for room as he advances, the batsman goes for the loft again, but doesn't get the elevation, long-on runs forward and completes a good low catch.

ZIMBABWE:44.1 Nathan McCullum to Chigumbura, SIX, in the airrrrr and just tipped over the bar! Guptill has misjudged that.

Flighted delivery on the stumps, Chigumbura advances and sends it over the long-on fenceNathan McCullum [8.0-0-49-2] is back into the attack10 off that over as well. 56 needed off 36, Chigu surely has to take some pressure off Ervine.

Although they lost the ODI series 3-2, they were very competitive in almost each game. A few players are missing this tour though. Their original skipper Brendon McCullum has been rested alongside a few others, while the likes of Trent Boult and Corey Anderson are missing due to injuries. Kane Williamson will be leading the side in McCullum's absence. We'll get you the toss and teams in a while. Stay tuned...Having had a tough time in international cricket, Zimbabwe finally managed to win a game as they beat India in the final T20I of the recently concluded series. Can they take some confidence from that win into this series against New Zealand? Hello and welcome to the first game of the 3-match ODI series. As was the case against India, all three games will be played in Harare. Zimbabwe had their moments in every match of the ODI series against India. They lost the series because they could not capture key moments. Captain Elton Chigumbura stressed about learning from past mistakes. Can they use the experience to good effect and do well against New Zealand?PreviewZimbabwe plan to tap into the renewed energy that sparked a victory over India recently as they take on an under-strength New Zealand side in a three-match one-day international series that starts on Sunday. After sleepwalking their way through a one-day series whitewash at the hands of India, Zimbabwe came to life in the final match of the tour as a fresh desire drove them to a 10-run victory in a Twenty20 match.While New Zealand will be without regular captain Brendon McCullum, new-ball bowlers Trent Boult and Tim Southee, and top all-rounder Corey Anderson, Zimbabwe coach Dav Whatmore says his team need to repeat the energy from their last game to have a chance."I just think we can do a bit better than what we did against India," Whatmore said. "To win the last game was very good, there was a different energy out there, and I think if we can reproduce that against New Zealand then we should have a little bit more joy. Despite McCullum, Southee and Boult not being here, they've still got a pretty decent team, but it's our home conditions so we have the ability to surprise."The hosts have been bolstered by all-rounder Luke Jongwe's recovery from injuries sustained in a car crash, and the return of fast bowler Tinashe Panyangara from a side strain, while off-spinner John Nyumbu has been recalled.Whatmore said that he planned to make an unexpected tweak to the batting line-up, but felt the bowling department was the one with the most room for improvement. "We gave India too many runs - we had them in trouble two out of the three ODI games and they still ended up scoring 25 or 30 runs too many, which put our batsmen under pressure chasing," said Whatmore.Having rested McCullum and Southee, and seen Boult and Anderson forced out of the tour by injury, New Zealand will get a glimpse of some future talent as they plot their path from a World Cup final appearance earlier this year to the 2019 edition of the tournament.Kane Williamson will captain the Black Caps on the tour, which also comprises a T20I match against Zimbabwe followed by two T20Is and three ODIs in South Africa. All-rounder George Worker could make his international debut and leg-spinner Ish Sodhi is in line for his first ODI appearance."If we are looking ahead to four years' time and the next World Cup, this is the perfect opportunity to start that development," New Zealand coach Mike Hesson said. "Two years ago we did the same with Corey Anderson, James Neesham and Mitch McClenaghan on their first tour."Sunday's game will see New Zealand play with "Aotearoa" on their shirts for the first time to mark the end of Maori Language Week back home. All three ODIs as well as the Twenty20 match will take place at Harare Sports Club.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Colin Munro, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan, James Neesham, Ish Sodhi, Ben Wheeler, Doug Bracewell, George WorkerZimbabwe (From): Chamu Chibhabha, Regis Chakabva(w), Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Craig Ervine, Prosper Utseya, Neville Madziva, Tinashe Panyangara, John Nyumbu, Luke Jongwe, Chris Mpofu, Graeme Cremer, Vusi SibandaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
