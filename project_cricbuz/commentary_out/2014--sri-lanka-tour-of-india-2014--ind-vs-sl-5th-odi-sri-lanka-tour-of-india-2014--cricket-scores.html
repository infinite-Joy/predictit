We will find out soon. Rahane and Rohit will open the innings for India.Kohli spoke about the dew factor in the second innings. Will it come to dent Sri Lanka's hopes? If it does come, batting will certainly be a little easy for the Indians. Take a break and join us back for the second innings.He helped Sri Lanka score 73 runs in the last 5 overs. In fact, 60 of them came from his bat. The pitch aided the slower bowlers and it turned square for the spinners at times. One end is quite dusty and all the spinners beat the bat regularly. However, Mathews hung around and fought hard to keep all the bowlers at bay, en route to recording his maiden ODI hundred in his 138th match and 116th innings. He hit 10 sixes in his knock and also had the chance to equal or break Jayasuriya's record of most sixes (11) against India, but Kulkarni bowled a good last over to deny him. Akshar was the pick of the Indian bowlers with 2/45, while Kulkarni bagged three wickets. Ashwin too bowled well, but Karn had an off day again, conceding over 60 runs in his quota of 10 overs.Finally in the series, Sri Lanka have done well with the bat. The conservative approach in the batting powerplay, in which they scored just 26 runs, has paid off. Early on, it was not all too easy for the visitors though. They were 85/4 at one stage, but skipper Mathews and Thirimanne combined well to stitch together a 128-run stand for the fifth wicket. India were put under serious pressure when Mathews went berserk.4

SRI LANKA:30.1 Karn Sharma to Thirimanne, no run, S Ravi is under pressure from Karn Sharma, but again he keeps his composure and gives it not out. That turned in sharply and pinged Thirimanne on the back foot, rapped on the pads on middle, but the turn would've taken it down leg. The bowler was convinced, but the ump wasn't

SRI LANKA:26.3 Karn Sharma to Thirimanne, no run, Karn Sharma belts out a huge lbw appeal but S Ravi doesn't give it. It pitches outside off and turns in sharply, the question was whether it hit Thirimanne in-line? Replays show that it may have struck the batsman just outside off. Good call? I'll leave that to you to judge
SRI LANKA:26.2 Karn Sharma to Mathews, 1 run, gets forward and drives sweetly to long-off
SRI LANKA:26.1 Karn Sharma to Mathews, no run, the leggie rips and spins past the probing outside edge of Mathews. It hit the crack and that produced the big turn

SRI LANKA:22.3 Ashwin to Mathews, no run, ooh! That kept very low, but Mathews managed to get his bat down in time, or else he would've been in serious trouble. Did close the bat face, but the leading edge bobbled down the track
SRI LANKA:22.2 Ashwin to Mathews, FOUR, that is a risky stroke. Shows all three stumps while going down to sweep, manages to get good bat on it to get it down to the fine leg fence
SRI LANKA:22.1 Ashwin to Mathews, no run, was there an outside edge on that? The reactions from Uthappa and Ashwin suggests so. Replays show that it may have missed the edge. The sound was that of bat hitting the boot. Missed the outside edge and Uthappa fumbled, and dropped it. Even if he had caught it, it wouldn't have mattered

SRI LANKA:18.3 Ashwin to M Jayawardene, out Caught by Rahane!! That is a big wicket. Turned sharply from outside off, Jayawardene was shaping to play the late dab towards third man, it hit the pad first - which forced an lbw appeal - but then went off the bat to slip, good call by the ump to spot the double noise.

SRI LANKA:17.1 Karn Sharma to Mathews, 2 runs, starts with a short and wide one outside off, Mathews cuts to deep backward point, for a couple of runsKarn Sharma, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackDrinks are on the field now. Familiar story for Sri Lanka. Their batting is in a mess at the moment and they are three down after 17 overs. Dilshan tried to hit everything too hard, while Chandimal mistimed everything. Both their struggling innings show how Sri Lanka's tour has panned out. It is left to the redoubtable pair of Jayawardene and Mathews to do the repair work once again. Whether they can do so remains to be seen..
SRI LANKA:16.6 A Patel to M Jayawardene, no run, goes back and glides it, but straight to the fielder at short third, that's 4 dots in a row after back-to-back boundaries off the first two
SRI LANKA:16.5 A Patel to M Jayawardene, no run, fired in flat and straight on the stumps, Jayawardene comes on the front foot and defends

SRI LANKA:16.3 A Patel to M Jayawardene, no run, gets forward and defends
SRI LANKA:16.2 A Patel to M Jayawardene, FOUR, consecutive boundaries for Jayawardene, he rocks back and pulls, Rohit gives chase but can't pull it back. In frustration he kicks the ad-cushions
SRI LANKA:16.1 A Patel to M Jayawardene, FOUR, that is a Jayawardene special. Just relies on timing and lifts it inside out over cover. Wanted to go over the man to get a boundary and does so effortlesslyExcellent captaincy by Kohli a couple of overs ago. He kept the mid-wicket area vacant, that tempted Chandimal to go for the big hit. But as he had done all innings, the timing was awry and he could only top-edge it.
SRI LANKA:15.6 Ashwin to Mathews, no run, fuller and flatter on the stumps, Mathews is content to defend, that is a maiden over from Ashwin
SRI LANKA:15.5 Ashwin to Mathews, no run, one hand comes off the bat handle as he adjusts for the sharp turn, played to the right of short mid-wicket, they thought about the single, but the fielder was quick
SRI LANKA:15.4 Ashwin to Mathews, no run, gently turns it to short mid-wicketA slip and a leg gully in place for Ashwin

SRI LANKA:15.1 Ashwin to Mathews, no run, gets half-forward and pushes it back to the bowler

SRI LANKA:14.5 A Patel to M Jayawardene, no run, gets forward and defendsAngelo Mathews, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:14.4 A Patel to Chandimal, out Caught by Rohit!! Chandimal's struggle comes to an end. Probably the last ball that turned sharply played on his mind. He went to slog-sweep this and top-edged it, a steepler but Rohit went back from mid-on and kept his eyes on it to grab. He kisses the ball after taking it and that makes it three down. Chandimal c Rohit b A Patel 5(31)A Patel to Chandimal, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:14.3 A Patel to Chandimal, no run, extravagant turn for Axar. Pitched on a crack and then turned sharply past Chandimal's defences. That will put a seed of doubt in the mind of the batter
SRI LANKA:14.2 A Patel to M Jayawardene, 1 run, takes it from outside off and sweeps to deep backward square leg
SRI LANKA:14.1 A Patel to M Jayawardene, no run, defended to the right of the bowler
SRI LANKA:13.6 Ashwin to M Jayawardene, 1 run, turned in, but Jayawardene went back and knew what he was doing so opts to glide it to the left of point, that keeps him on strike next over
SRI LANKA:13.5 Ashwin to M Jayawardene, no run, presses forward and defends it back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:13.4 Ashwin to M Jayawardene, FOUR, that is a fine stroke! Jayawardene at the last instant opened the face to send it wide of the diving slip. Knew what he was doing all the while. That is a trademark Jayawardene shot, always plays it late and inevitably gets it in the gapA slip in place for Ashwin
SRI LANKA:13.3 Ashwin to Chandimal, 1 run, uses his feet and flicks it past the square leg umpire
SRI LANKA:13.2 Ashwin to Chandimal, no run, spin for Ashwin too, Chandimal got outside off and missed the whip to leg, it rolls off the pads wide of slip
SRI LANKA:13.1 Ashwin to M Jayawardene, 1 run, gently opens the face of the bat and guides it wide of backward point, to the left of the fielder and a single is takenRavichandran Ashwin, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:12.6 A Patel to Chandimal, no run, pushed to short cover, a bit of a yes no from the batsmen, but eventually they remain at their ends as Virat Kohli fieldsA slip and a short cover in place
SRI LANKA:12.5 A Patel to Chandimal, no run, superb delivery! Beats Chandimal all ends up, slower and tossed up, it lures Chandimal on the front foot and then beats the batsman's defensive push. Uthappa had the bails off in a flash, but Chandimal was going nowhere
SRI LANKA:12.4 A Patel to Chandimal, no run, goes on the back foot and punches it to mid-on
SRI LANKA:12.3 A Patel to M Jayawardene, 1 run, plays an angled steer square of the wicket on the off-side and gets a single
SRI LANKA:12.2 A Patel to M Jayawardene, no run, that spun! Since the length was short, it allowed Jayawardene to go on the back foot and adjust, steered away to the off-side
SRI LANKA:12.1 A Patel to M Jayawardene, FOUR, very short and dragged down, Jayawardene goes on the back foot and hammers the pull to the vacant deep mid-wicket fence, one bounce over the ropesAkshar Patel, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:11.6 Binny to Chandimal, no run, that has been smashed straight back and before Binny could bend down, it hit the boot - I guess of the bowler. The ball ricochets away and one has to be a very hard man to call that a dropped chance, or a chance at all. It hit the right ankle of Binny before he could react
SRI LANKA:11.5 Binny to Chandimal, no run, slower delivery outside off, chopped straight to the fielder at point. No timing on that again
SRI LANKA:11.4 Binny to Chandimal, no run, what was that? Binny has a stare accompanied by a wry smile at Chandimal. The batsman advanced and slogged, missed it totally and was lucky that the ball moved away to miss the off stump. That wouldn't have looked good if he had got out
SRI LANKA:11.3 Binny to Chandimal, no run, loud shout for lbw, but Oxenford rules it not out. The off-cutter from Binny, raps Chandimal on the back leg, after missing the pad, but struck the batsman high on the leg and it would've gone over. The right call was made
SRI LANKA:11.2 Binny to Chandimal, no run, that should've been put away to the fence, instead Chandimal has completely mistimed the pull to short mid-wicket, where Rahane makes a fine stop. Took it from outside off and didn't get hold of it at all
SRI LANKA:11.1 Binny to M Jayawardene, 1 run, shuffles across a tad to off and then defends it wide of mid-on for a comfortable single
SRI LANKA:10.6 D Kulkarni to M Jayawardene, 1 run, another off-cutter, down leg, a single to deep backward square leg will keep Chandimal on strike next over

SRI LANKA:10.3 D Kulkarni to M Jayawardene, 1 run, picks the slower delivery on off and middle, turned past short mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:10.2 D Kulkarni to M Jayawardene, FOUR, looks like Jayawardene was waiting to play that stroke. Once he saw it was pitched up on off, he went through with the lofted hit over wide long-on, the ball bounces away to the ropes
SRI LANKA:10.1 D Kulkarni to M Jayawardene, no run, defended with soft hands to the left of the short mid-wicket fielde
SRI LANKA:9.6 Binny to Chandimal, no run, now Binny does something different. Goes wide of the crease and angles it in, Chandimal is squared up and the thick outside edge rolls to point. Very unconvincing so far has been Chandimal in this innings
SRI LANKA:9.5 Binny to Chandimal, no run, much better - gets forward and shows the full face of the bat to drive to mid-off
SRI LANKA:9.4 Binny to Chandimal, 2 runs, Chandimal gets away with an ugly swipe across the line. Tried to slog and the bat turned in his hand as the shot was completed, lobs over mid-on and it's a couple of runs
SRI LANKA:9.3 Binny to M Jayawardene, 1 run, down leg, lovely flick of the wrists, but picks out deep backward square leg

SRI LANKA:8.3 D Kulkarni to M Jayawardene, no run, slower delivery, the off-cutter, Jayawardene defends solidly
SRI LANKA:8.2 D Kulkarni to M Jayawardene, 2 runs, turned past mid-wicket, played with soft hands and that allows a couple past the fielder
SRI LANKA:8.1 D Kulkarni to M Jayawardene, no run, S Ravi the umpire isn't interested despite a big appeal from Kulkarni, it was going down leg and that was the right call from Ravi after Jayawardene missed the flick
SRI LANKA:7.6 Binny to Chandimal, no run, maiden over from Binny, Chandimal tries to go hard on the shot through the off-side, mistimed it to mid-off
SRI LANKA:7.5 Binny to Chandimal, no run, angled into off and middle, Chandimal flicks nicely but can't beat mid-on
SRI LANKA:7.4 Binny to Chandimal, no run, gentle swing for Binny, Chandimal drives without any timing to mid-on

SRI LANKA:6.6 D Kulkarni to M Jayawardene, no run, presses forward and defends solidly to short cover
SRI LANKA:6.5 D Kulkarni to M Jayawardene, no run, he definitely played at it, fullish outside off, Jayawardene dangled the bat at it and then pulled out of the shot, by then the ball had gone past
SRI LANKA:6.4 D Kulkarni to Chandimal, 1 run, that hurried onto Chandimal, down leg and the short ball was awkwardly played by Chandimal, as he swivelled on the shot, off the toe-end, maybe a bit of glove too, the ball runs wide of square leg
SRI LANKA:6.3 D Kulkarni to Chandimal, no run, gets forward and pushes it towards mid-on, no chance of a quick single
SRI LANKA:6.2 D Kulkarni to Chandimal, no run, nip-backer, but Chandimal covers his off stump and lets it go

SRI LANKA:5.6 Binny to Dilshan, out Bowled!! Binny has broken through here. The off-cutter has gone on to hit the stumps. Played the flick too early, closed the face and missed the flick, the ball brushed the pad en route to hitting the stumps. Poor dismissal that and Sri Lanka are in familiar trouble. Binny is all smiles. Dilshan b Binny 35(24) [4s-7]Binny to Dilshan, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
SRI LANKA:5.5 Binny to Dilshan, no run, probing fuller length delivery outside off, Dilshan wanted to play and then left it alone
SRI LANKA:5.4 Binny to Dilshan, FOUR, the shot of the innings so far! It was not a half-volley, but Dilshan just leant forward and played a superb off-drive, caressing the ball past mid-off, who didn't even dive. The rich timing fuels it to the fence
SRI LANKA:5.3 Binny to Dilshan, no run, in the corridor of uncertainty, on a fuller length, left alone
SRI LANKA:5.2 Binny to Dilshan, no run, short of length outside off, guided to point with an open face
SRI LANKA:5.1 Binny to Dilshan, FOUR, smashed! Picks the harmless short delivery and blasts it wide of square leg, it was in the air, but no chance for the fielder as it was well wide of him. The ball rockets to the fenceReplays for that Dickwella dismissal show that it was a slower delivery by Kulkarni. Also good to see the batsman walking off trusting the fielder's word, instead of asking the umpire to check whether it was a clean grab. I can remember a certain Jacques Kallis doing that. Good on you Dickwella. Saves time too.
SRI LANKA:4.6 D Kulkarni to Chandimal, no run, presses forward and defends it back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:4.5 D Kulkarni to Chandimal, no run, another short delivery, but this one is not so high so Chandimal can duck under it and let it go
SRI LANKA:4.5 D Kulkarni to Chandimal, 5 wides, that is almost Ambrose-esque from Kulkarni. He digs it in very short and the leaping Uthappa had no chance as the ball flew away to the fence. 5 runs for Sri Lanka, but Kulkarni really tested the pitch hard and extracted good bounceDinesh Chandimal, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:4.4 D Kulkarni to Dickwella, out Caught by Rayudu!! Well caught at square leg. It was flicked uppishly in the air and Rayudu had to dive forward to get his fingers under the ball, he does so and claims the catch which is good enough for Dickwella, he walks off. A disappointing debut for him. Dickwella c Rayudu b D Kulkarni 4(10)D Kulkarni to Dickwella, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:4.3 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, 3 runs, cut to point where Axar hits the stumps at the bowler's end direct, but Dilshan was well in, the ball ricochets away and that allows another couple of runs - bonus ones for Dilshan and Sri Lanka
SRI LANKA:4.2 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, no run, now Kulkarni beats Dilshan for pace with a delivery that is sliding down leg, catches the batsman on the pads, beating his flick, no real appeal for lbw as it was going down
SRI LANKA:4.1 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, FOUR, this is a strange sort of innings from Dilshan so far. After a streaky stroke off the previous delivery, he has creamed this to the sweeper fence on the off-side. Made his own width and cracked the cut over the left-hand of the leaping cover point fielder
SRI LANKA:3.6 Binny to Dilshan, 1 run, if gully was there, it would've been straight to him, Dilshan going hard at one outside off and outside-edging it in that vacant area
SRI LANKA:3.5 Binny to Dilshan, no run, Dilshan is trying to smash the leather of the ball, here he comes forward and drills it straight to the fielder at mid-off
SRI LANKA:3.4 Binny to Dilshan, FOUR, width from Binny and that was what Dilshan was waiting for. He carves it over the infield on the off-side, only one result and that was a boundary
SRI LANKA:3.3 Binny to Dilshan, no run, stump to stump line from Binny, Dilshan can only defend it back to Binny
SRI LANKA:3.2 Binny to Dilshan, no run, again tries to do something extraordinary, to a back of a length delivery that is rising, the bottom-handed whip doesn't contain any timing and again he finds mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:3.1 Binny to Dilshan, no run, that is a good delivery, forced Dilshan to play a false stroke, tried to push with his feet stuck, the inside edge rolls away to mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:2.6 D Kulkarni to Dickwella, no run, looked like a cutter on the stumps, Dickwella gently defends it back to Kulkarni
SRI LANKA:2.5 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, 1 run, whipped off the hips down to deep backward square leg
SRI LANKA:2.4 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, no run, Kulkarni cramps Dilshan for room, punched back to the bowler without any timing
SRI LANKA:2.3 D Kulkarni to Dickwella, 1 run, angled across Dickwella on a short of length, the batsman opens the face of the bat and guides it wide of point, for an easy single
SRI LANKA:2.2 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, 1 run, tries to punch-drive through cover, on-the-up, mistimed wide of extra cover, good enough though to take a single
SRI LANKA:2.1 D Kulkarni to Dickwella, leg byes, 1 run, drifts down leg, bobbles off the pads as the batsman misses the flick, they take a leg-bye
SRI LANKA:1.6 Binny to Dickwella, 1 run, if Kedar Jadhav had picked it up cleanly first time, he would've got Dilshan out. It was turned to him at square leg, he juggled the take and that allowed Dilshan to make up time, got in and beat the direct hit. Binny looks a tad disappointed. A chance and a half-one at that goes abegging
SRI LANKA:1.5 Binny to Dickwella, no run, angling into the pads, flicked, but straight to the fielder at mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:1.4 Binny to Dilshan, 1 run, short of length outside off, bit of extra bounce, but Dilshan plays it well, opening the face and guiding it down to third manShort cover in place for Binny against Dilshan
SRI LANKA:1.3 Binny to Dickwella, 1 run, gets forward and drives it wide of mid-off, easy single
SRI LANKA:1.2 Binny to Dickwella, no run, pitched up on off, Dickwella shows the full face of the bat and pushes it to mid-offJust a slip in place for Binny. Regulation field with point, cover and mid-off in place
SRI LANKA:1.1 Binny to Dickwella, no run, good length on off stump, Dickwella gets forward and plays a solid forward defensive to coverStuart Binny, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:0.6 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, FOUR, third boundary of the over for Dilshan. This is not as well-timed as the first one, but he got it wide of a diving cover and that was enough. Too much width from Kulkarni and he was made to pay by the Lankan
SRI LANKA:0.5 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, no run, outswinger, nice shape on that, Dilshan lifts his bat and lets it go after watching it
SRI LANKA:0.4 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, FOUR, very streaky and Dilshan gets away. Went hard at it, the inside edge missed the leg stump and raced away beating fine leg, who had no chance. Back-to-back boundaries for Dilshan
SRI LANKA:0.3 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, FOUR, nice stroke! It was angling in to off and middle, but he used his wrists to flick it wide of mid-on. All timing and it raced away. Confident stroke that
SRI LANKA:0.2 D Kulkarni to Dilshan, no run, very loose from Dilshan. First ball he faces and he has aimed for an extravagant slash through the off-side. The ball seams back in and misses the inside edge, before going through to Uthappa, who does well to bend down low and collect
SRI LANKA:0.1 D Kulkarni to Dickwella, 1 run, that's a misfield first up! Driven straight to the fielder at mid-on who is Rohit Sharma, he bends down to field, but is hit on the wrist, the ball bobbles away and that allows Dickwella to get off the mark on his debutDickwella and Dilshan are at the crease. Dickwella is on strike. D Kulkarni will open the attackThe players are walking out to the middle. Dilshan and Dickwella shake hands before coming out. The crowd is in good voice. Dhawal Kulkarni will begin and it will be the left-hander who will face off first up. Here we go..Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Niroshan Dickwella, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Ajantha Mendis, Shaminda Eranga, Lahiru GamageIndia (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Ambati Rayudu, Virat Kohli(c), Robin Uthappa(w), Kedar Jadhav, Stuart Binny, Akshar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Karn Sharma, Dhawal KulkarniRussel Arnold tweeted that Dickwella will make his ODI debut for Sri Lanka.Kohli: "Quite happy. I am happy to bowl first. The locals have said that dew factor comes into play in the evening. We are playing 3 spinners. We want to make the best use of the dry conditions. Jadhav makes his debut in place of Raina. Umesh has been rested, Ashwin comes in. Right now, I am happy to drop down to four. MS is not there and it is important to ensure that the new guys are confident for the World Cup. If I get to 60,70, today I will ensure that I convert it."Mathews: "It looks a pretty dry wicket. It might turn later on and I want to put runs on the board and bat first. Pride keeps us motivated. We are not a team to be beaten 0-5. We have played well this year. We will have to get a big total."Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to bat'Heads' calls Mathews. Heads it is.The two captains walk out for the toss.Pitch report: "Even in the afternoon in Ranchi, you can feel the coolness. The pitch looks famine-stricken. It is dry and cracked. The cracks have not broken up a great deal. However, there is quite a bit of grass at the other end. It is a Jekyll and Hyde pitch" reckon Sanjay Manjrekar and Michael HoldingOn this day last year in Mumbai, Sachin Tendulkar bid adieu, ending his decorated 24-year career.The pitch at Ranchi has predominantly been slowish and is expected to aid the spinners. It remains to be seen if the dew factor unsettles the bowlers in the second half.STAT ALERT: The last and only time India blanked Sri Lanka in a bilateral series was in 1982 when India won 3-0.Hello and welcome to the fifth and final ODI between India and Sri Lanka. Suresh Raina has been rested ahead of the bigger battles in Australia. Kedar Jadhav is primed for his international debut.On the contrary, it has been all gloom and doom for Sri Lanka in all three departments. As Mathews put it, the Islanders have been no match for the hosts. The series is in India's pocket, but Sri Lanka have pride and respect to play for. Can Mathews' men pull off a consolation win and gain much-needed confidence ahead of the ODI series against England? Or will India sweep the series 5-0?There have been quite a few positives for the hosts in this hastily-arranged series. The form of Dhawan, Rahane and Rohit of course, comes as a welcome headache to the selectors. Rayudu too had stepped up to stake his claim for a permanent World Cup berth. Meanwhile, young Axar has made a statement of sorts, out-bowling Jadeja.It has been India all the way. Their dominance hit its peak in the penultimate ODI with Rohit Sharma smashing 264 of his own, while Sri Lanka fell 13 short of Rohit and 153 short of India's total. Kohli though has urged his team not to let the intensity down and keep playing ruthless cricket.PreviewHaving decimated the opposition with clinical precision in all four matches, India will be aiming to complete a clean sweep when they take on a struggling Sri Lanka in the fifth and final cricket one-dayer in Ranchi on Sunday. With the series already in their pocket, the Virat Kohli-led team would like to finish with a 5-0 scoreline which will be a confidence booster with the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 starting in less than 100 days time.If India has been thoroughly professional in their first three outings, the penultimate one at Eden Gardens, turned out to be historic, with Rohit Sharma smashing his way into the record books with a highest individual ODI score of 264. India went on to rout the islanders by 153 runs.Rohit made merry on his return to international cricket after sustaining a finger injury during the ODI series in England. The Mumbaikar unfortunately missed out on the first three ODIs as the team had already been picked by then but he had made his intentions clear with a 111-ball 145 in the warm-up match against Sri Lanka, his first competitive game since recovery. He was brought in place of Shikhar Dhawan, the leading run-getter in the series so far, in a slew of changes for the last two ODIs and he has seized the opportunity to perfection. It was a lesson to watch Rohit pace his innings - he took 100 balls for his first hundred and took 73 balls for the next 164 in an incredible innings.The knock would have left the Lankans shell-shocked, and India will hope to capitalize on that in the final game. India's batting looks as solid as solid can be, with everyone in the top-order looking in good form.In the bowling, Umesh Yadav has been a revelation with the new ball and leads the tally with 10 scalps, while rookie left-arm spinner Axar Patel is posing to be a tough competitor for Ravindra Jadeja with nine victims from four matches. It remains to be seen whether the team think tank chooses to tinker in the line-up bringing in the likes of Ranganath Vinay Kumar and Kedar Jadhav to have a look-in.Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews has admitted that nothing was going their way after a string of embarrassing failures. The worst part was that they were never able to give India any competition. If the bowling has lacked the venom in absence of their sling-arm fast bowler Lasith Malinga, its better not to say something about the fielding which has failed to give them the back-up.After their most insipid effort during the last match, the Sri Lankans will have to regroup and at least play for respect in order to end the series on a positive note. It would start with their bowling attack that conceded 233 runs in the last 18 overs in Eden Gardens while in batting too their top order have to get back to runs.According to the curator, the pitch has a bit of bounce and will aid spinners later on but its the dew which may turn out to be a big factor.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Nuwan Kulasekara, Shaminda Eranga, Ajantha Mendis, Chaturanga de Silva, Ashan Priyanjan, Lahiru Gamage, Niroshan DickwellaIndia (From): Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Ambati Rayudu, Virat Kohli(c), Robin Uthappa(w), Kedar Jadhav, Stuart Binny, Akshar Patel, Karn Sharma, Dhawal Kulkarni, Umesh Yadav, Ravichandran Ashwin, Vinay KumarLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
