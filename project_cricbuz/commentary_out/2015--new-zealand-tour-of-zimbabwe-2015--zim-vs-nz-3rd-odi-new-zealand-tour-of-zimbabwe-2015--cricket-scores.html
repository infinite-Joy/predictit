H Masakadza is on strike. Ben Wheeler will open the attackWelcome back.. Zimbabwe have not won an ODI series since 2013. Last time was versus Bangladesh when they won 2-1. This is their best chance? Can they pull one over the World Cup runner's up? The openers stride out to the centre. Ben Wheeler to start proceedings. Just one slip in place. All set to go...Cremer: "I am happy with my bowling. The wicket assisted the spinners more than what we thought. We knew spin was always going to play a big part and that's why we played an extra spinner. I think this is a par score and we can chase it down."The spinners were brilliant. With the pitch offering bit of assistance, the trio of Cremer, Nyumbu and Williams shared the wickets to fall. Zimbabwe need 274 to win the series. Join us back in a few minutes to find out if they can haul this total down.Chigumbura expected his fast bowlers to do the job in the first hour. However, it was the spinners who delivered. Guptill and Latham got the visitors off to a steady start, but the introduction of spin brought about the downfall of Latham. Guptill and Williamson added a 50-plus stand before the former was snaffled by Cremer. Munro didn't last long and it was left to Elliott to support his skipper. The duo added 70 runs, but fell in succession. Some late striking from Neesham and Nathan McCullum took the total past the 270-mark. 4

Off we go...Williamson: "We would have had a bat. It looks a lot drier than the previous wicket. Unfortunately, Ross Taylor suffered an injury and is out for the remainder of the series. James Neesham comes in and Ben Wheeler replaces Matt Henry."Chigumbura: "We are going to bowl first. We have to make sure we use the first hour to our advantage. The first session in the morning does a bit. I hope we can bat well and chase down whatever they put up. We have two changes, Nyumbu and Madziva come in for Utseya and Mpofu."Pitch Report: "It looks very bare and there is dead grass. It looks like a bat first kind of wicket, but as we have seen in the series, the team that wins the toss would want to bowl first," reckons Ed RainsfordTeams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Hamilton Masakadza, Chamu Chibhabha, Craig Ervine, Regis Chakabva(w), Elton Chigumbura(c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Graeme Cremer, John Nyumbu, Tinashe Panyangara, Neville MadzivaNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Grant Elliott, Colin Munro, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Ben Wheeler, Ish Sodhi, Mitchell McClenaghanWow! What luck Chigu has. This is the sixth toss he's won in a row. Two changes for New Zealand, Matt Henry and injured Ross Taylor make way for Ben Wheeler and James Neesham.Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldChigu has been calling the right side of the coin for a while now. For the first time in 5 ODIs, he opted to bat in the last game but the ploy didn't work as his batsmen were put under serious pressure. Will he win another toss? We'll get to know in a short while. Stay tuned...The batsmen though did not put enough runs on the board on a pitch that was relatively easy for batting. "The way we batted up front was disappointing as we lost too many wickets. I thought 236 was not enough on that wicket," said a disappointed Elton Chigumbura after the match. Can Chigu and his boys put up an improved performance and bag a rare series win? Time will gives us the answer. Kane Williamson though was a happy man as his bowlers, who were pretty poor in the first ODI, bowled in the right areas for most of the time.Superlative efforts from Martin Guptill and Tom Latham helped New Zealand square the series 1-1 a few days ago. We are all set for the decider today as the teams lock horns for one last time in the series for the title. Hello and welcome to the third ODI in Harare. Although Sikandar Raza's magnificent hundred bailed Zimbabwe out of trouble, their bowlers lacked discipline and hardly troubled the New Zealand openers.Preview:With the series level at 1-1, Zimbabwe and the visiting New Zealand team will be eager to bring out their best game during the third ODI in the battle to clinch the three-match series at the Harare Sports Club. While the hosts managed to surprise the Black Caps in the opening ODI with a thrilling victory, the visiting side came back with a strong performance in the second game, riding on a record opening stand to secure a 10-wicket win. New Zealand will be hoping to continue in the same vein, but the spirited Zimbabwe side will leave no stone unturned in their attempt to upset the 2015 World Cup runners-up again.Craig Ervine's match-winning ton in the first ODI, Hamilton Masakadza's useful half-century in the same game and Sikander Raza fighting hundred in the previous ODI have been the only noteworthy performances by the Zimbabwe batsmen. Zimbabwe will be hoping that Chamu Chibhabha and Elton Chigumbura also lend solid support at the top of the order. The bowling is a bigger concern for the hosts as the likes of Chris Mpofu, Tinashe Panyangara and Prosper Utseya haven't been effective with the ball.New Zealand batsmen have been in fine touch during this series. Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor extended their good run with sizeable contributions in the first match while Martin Guptill and Tom Latham starred with unbeaten centuries in the second game. The hosts will be hoping that the batsmen can do a good job again and expect the bowlers, who came back well in the second ODI after going for a few in the opening encounter, to maintain the discipline.Match Date: August 7, 2015Start Time: 9:00 local (12:30 IST)Venue: Harare Sports Club, HarareWeather: Plenty of sunshine, high of 23 degree CelsiusTeam News:Zimbabwe:Malcolm Waller has replaced Vusi Sibanda in the Zimbabwe squad for the third ODI. However, the 30-year-old is unlikely to feature in the eleven as Zimbabwe might look at an unchanged batting order. Meanwhile, Chris Mpofu, who has gone wicket-less and an economy of more than seven, could make way for Neville Madziva, who picked up six wickets in the series against India.Probable XI: Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura (c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Regis Chakabva, Graeme Cremer, Prosper Utseya, Tinashe Panyangara, Neville MadzivaNew Zealand:Jimmy Neesham, who had some soreness and missed the second ODI, should be fit and he is likely to replace Colin Munro. That is the only likely change in the New Zealand eleven for Friday's game as coach Mike Hesson said New Zealand will not look to rush back Adam Milne, who is recovering from a minor niggle.Probable XI: Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson (c), Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi (wk), Nathan McCullum, Mitchell McClenaghan, Matt Henry, Ish Sodhi.Quotes:"Tom has been asked to do a number of different roles and he's done that without any complaints. He has fitted in wherever the team has needed him. To be able to give him some consistency around this tour and say you'll be opening with Martin and then to get a century in his second game ... it probably doesn't surprise too many of us because we know what a quality player he is."- New Zealand coach Mike Hesson is pleased that Tom Latham is making most of the opportunities given to him.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Colin Munro, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan, Ish Sodhi, Ben Wheeler, Doug Bracewell, George Worker, James Neesham, Adam MilneZimbabwe (From): Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura(c), Regis Chakabva(w), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Graeme Cremer, Prosper Utseya, Tinashe Panyangara, Chris Mpofu, John Nyumbu, Vusi Sibanda, Luke Jongwe, Neville MadzivaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
