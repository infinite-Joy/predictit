The Proteas have an opportunity to wrap up the 5-match series in the 4th match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info....by Vishaal LoganathanPakistan have come back admirably from the sorry state they seemed to be in after the 1st ODI. They pulled off a miraculous win in the second ODI and almost did a repeat in the third, but South Africa eventually scraped through by 2 runs. Pakistan's confidence seems renewed by the win at Abu Dhabi and they will be going into this match looking to level the series and go into the final match with the winning momentum on their side.Pakistan:In spite of some brilliant bowling by Shoaib Akthar and the other Pak bowlers, the Proteas were able to get a decent score on the board thanks to the impervious Hashim Amla. Pakistan bowlers' first objective will be to see the back of the in form Amla as soon as possible in the 4th ODI. They, however, did well to eventually restrict the Proteas to 228 and would've backed themselves to get the score.They almost pulled off the win with significant contributions by Imran Farhat, Asad Shafiq and Fawad Alam, but their knocks went in vain as they fell agonizingly short at the end. The other batsmen will be disappointed to have not supported the set batsmen and will want a more gutsy performance in the 4th ODI.South Africa:The Proteas will be mighty relieved to have regained the lead with their narrowest ODI win over Pakistan. They did well to hold their nerve at the end and finish victors.Their total of 228 was thanks largely to a brilliant 100 by Amla. The rest of the batsmen failed to provide support to the opener and they will want to make up for that with more significant performances in this ODI.Their bowling was a much more disciplined effort, with both the opening bowlers, Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe keeping things tight and picking up regular wickets. Their bowlers were able to stifle the Pakistani batsmen which helped them win of the last ball.A win for the Proteas will see them gain an unassailable 3-1 lead and clinch the series. Pakistan will do everything they can to ensure that the series is decided in the 5th and final ODI at Dubai. Everything looks set for another cracker of a contest.Teams:Pakistan (From): Imran Farhat, Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan, Asad Shafiq, Fawad Alam, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Zulqarnain Haider(w), Saeed Ajmal, Wahab Riaz, Shoaib Akhtar, Abdur Rehman, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shahzaib Hasan, Tanvir Ahmed, Umar Akmal, Umar GulSouth Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Colin Ingram, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Albie Morkel, Johan Botha(c), Juan Theron, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Graeme Smith, Dale Steyn, Charl LangeveldtLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
