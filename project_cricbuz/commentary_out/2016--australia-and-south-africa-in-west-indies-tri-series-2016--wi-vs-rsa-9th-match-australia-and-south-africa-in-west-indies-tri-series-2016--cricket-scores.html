Beaten for pace and bounce. The mess gets messier for the visitors. Duminy c Benn b Holder 5(7)Holder to Duminy, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SOUTH AFRICA:13.6 Narine to Behardien, no run, goes for the reverse-sweep. Very, very close. The ball hit him full in front of the stumps, probably doing a touch too much. The umpire thinks so. Behardien survives. Three reds on Hawk-Eye, had West Indies reviewed, Behardien was a goner

SOUTH AFRICA:3.4 S Gabriel to de Kock, out Caught by Ramdin!! This time Gabriel strikes. Bowls this on a good length just outside off, hint of shape back into the left-hander. Just enough to take the inside edge that carries to the keeper, Ramdin did well to dive to his right and take it with his right hand inches above the ground, he had to change directions - went to his left and then had to go low to his right.

Holder will open the attackHolder with the new cherry with just a slip in placeFor South Africa, Rabada bowled with verve and purpose as he picked up 3 wickets. The bowling was disciplined in the first half but lost it when the batsmen started to have a go at them. The Proteas have not been the best of chasers. A spot in the final beckons. Who will come out on top? We'll find out in a short while...From 21/4, West Indies have recovered well to post 285. When Rabada ripped apart the top-order, things weren't looking great for Holder and Co. but Bravo and Pollard combined well to share a 156-run counter-attacking stand to swing the pendulum back in West Indies' favour. Even after Pollard's departure, Bravo carried on and scored his third ODI hundred. He soon fell trying to up the ante. Skipper Holder was little shaky to start off with, he soon found his element and scored a handy 40. Brathwaite came in and played a brief cameo towards the end.4
WEST INDIES:49.5 Parnell to S Gabriel, out S Gabriel Run Out!! West Indies have been bowled out for 285. This was a length delivery on off, Gabriel made room and drove it towards mid-off, they were always going for the single. As Gabriel was about to complete his run, he saw Amla charging towards the bowler's end, the concentration snapped and so did the momentum. Gabriel was trying to avoid colliding into Amla, lost all the momentum and was found well short as Behardien made a direct hit at the bowler's end. Brathwaite has a word with AB, but Amla didn't come block Gabriel's path on purpose and the decision stands. S Gabriel run out (F Behardien) 2(6)Parnell to S Gabriel, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!Clumsy running from Gabriel, he might be short here. The bat is in the air and he's short of his ground as well. OUT is the call

WEST INDIES:48.5 Rabada to S Gabriel, 2 runs, de Kock drops the ball and that allows Gabriel to make his ground!

This was banged in short and just outside off, Benn went for the pull, doesn't bother to keep it down. Behardien runs a fair way from deep mid-wicket, puts in the dive and clasps it safely, inches above the turf. Brathwaite is running out of partners now.

It's going to spin. Overall, it is a great wicket and expect a lot of runs." reckons Damien MartynTeams:West Indies (Playing XI): Johnson Charles, Andre Fletcher, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Kieron Pollard, Carlos Brathwaite, Jason Holder(c), Sunil Narine, Sulieman Benn, Shannon GabrielSouth Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirHolder: "Doing a bit of training at the physio's table to get fit for this game and have got to a stage where I can manage playing. Would have liked to bowl first as well but I don't think the pitch would change much. If we get through the first powerplay, things will get easier. We've got a trump card in Sunil Narine, we back him to get the wickets for us."AB: "We've batted first a few times and haven't done badly. The wicket isn't going to change much over the game, knowing what to get makes it easier. Spinners are going to play a huge role despite the track being flat. Good opportunity for all of us, hopefully we'll put up a good show and make it to the finals."South Africa have won the toss and have opted to field12:02 Local Time, 16:02 GMT, 21:32 IST: Howdy folks! Welcome to the final match of the round-robin leg of this unsurprisingly close tour which has dragged on till the last match to decide which of these two teams make it to the all important final. With all to play for, the mighty South Africans would be looking to take on an inspired Windies side at the same ground where they had to make peace with a 99-overs short contest, a few days ago. The hosts on the other hand would be looking to prove a point by making it to the finals, especially since they've been knocked out of the Champions Trophy. With Samuels looking in red hot form and Imran Tahir still fresh from having steamrolled the West Indies a few nights ago, we are in for a crackerjack of a contest.With only one spot up for grabs in the final of the tri-series, West Indies and South Africa will take on each other in a do-or-die contest at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown on Friday (June 24). With two bonus points and a washed out match, South Africa are four points ahead of the hosts. However, the Jason Holder-led side will need only a win in the last match of the league phase to tie with South Africa on points, and with number of wins being the first criteria in case teams are tied on points, the hosts would seal a spot in the final.Unlike the initial stages of the tournament, the Kensington Oval track has played slightly on the quicker side. While there is more assistance for the pacers and the batsmen, spinners won't be as potent. Thus the most successful bowlers for West Indies and South Africa, so far in the series, Sunil Narine and Imran Tahir can't be relied upon too heavily.On the batting front, South Africa's top order batsmen Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis have had a good series. However, AB de Villiers and JP Duminy haven't come as handy. There was an odd fight by Farhaan Behardien and Wayne Parnell, but consistency still remains their nemesis.On the other hand, West Indies' story has been quite contrasting so far with the top order failing to fire. Their number four - Marlon Samuels - has had to do the bulk of the scoring, with Kieron Pollard's occasional blitz late down the order. Denesh Ramdin came good in the previous encounter, which augurs well for the team. On the consistency front, they remain a few notches below the Proteas.When: West Indies vs South Africa, June 23, 1:00 PM local (10:30 PM IST)Where: Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, BarbadosWhat to expect: It is expected to remain sunny for most parts of the day, with a couple of light spells of rains expected.Team News:Jason Holder remains a doubtful started for the crucial clash as he is still suffering from a hamstring injury. The decision on whether he will play or miss out will be taken on Friday afternoon, a few hours before the match. In case he fails to recover in time, Ramdin will lead the side. The visitors will most likely go in with only a solitary spinner, and have the experience of Morne Morkel to go with the pace attack of Kagiso Rabada, Chris Morris and Wayne Parnell.Who said what:"We've played quite a few really close series in the past, like this one, where we've had a few must-win games. We enjoy those kind of situations. We like to bring the fight when it matters most. It's a great opportunity for us to prove that we are that kind of team under pressure." - AB de VilliersDid you know?Marlon Samuels needs 77 runs to surpass Gordan Greenidge on the list of most run-getters in ODIsTeams:South Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Aaron Phangiso, Kyle Abbott, Tabraiz Shamsi, Dean ElgarWest Indies (From): Jonathan Carter, Andre Fletcher, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Kieron Pollard, Carlos Brathwaite, Jason Holder(c), Sunil Narine, Sulieman Benn, Shannon Gabriel, Johnson Charles, Ashley NurseLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
