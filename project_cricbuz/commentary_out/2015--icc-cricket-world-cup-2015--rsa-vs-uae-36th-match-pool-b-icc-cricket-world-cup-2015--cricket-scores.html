AB de Villiers then introduced Morne Morkel into the attack and he immediately made an impact by extracting disconcerting bounce to produce the edge off Berenger's bat and Rilee Rossouw took an excellent catch one-handed at point. Amjad followed him back to the pavilion as he was dismissed by JP Duminy. On the other hand, Morkel continued to trouble UAE's batsmen with pace and bounce and was rewarded with the wicket of Khurram Khan.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 16 overs: Amjad Ali and Andri Berenger gave a good account of themselves against the pace duo of Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn. It was Amjad, who took advantage of a half-volley bowled by Steyn to flick it for a boundary. He showed good wrist-work to flick Philander for a four as well. Drinks are on the field now

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.1 Steyn to Amjad Ali, no run, fuller in length with a hint of shape away outside off, Ali goes across and shoulders armsAmjad Ali and Andri Berenger are at the crease. Amjad Ali is on strike. Steyn will open the attackWelcome back. The South African players are making their way out to the middle, followed by the UAE openers. Dale Steyn will open the bowling. Amjad Ali will be on strike first up. There are two slips in place. Here we go then...Miller: "Definitely it was great to be out there again. It was nice to get a partnership with AB. I am really enjoying the opportunity to bat a bit longer and set the innings up. Obviously we have played consistent cricket in the last one, one and half year."After losing to Pakistan in their last game, the South African pacers would look to bowl with fire and aggression to skittle out the opposition for a paltry score. At the other end of the spectrum, UAE's batsmen have a daunting task of facing up to a world-class attack. On the other hand, UAE would rue missed opportunities. Saqlain Haider missed a chance to run out Miller. Tauqir dropped a catch to give Miller another reprieve. To make it worse, Amjad dropped a caught and bowled chance as de Villiers survived. In fact, their bowlers, especially, Naveed and Tauqir gave a good account of themselves, but their fielding was a let down. David Miller too played a fine hand. He had his share of good fortune, but it was Miller, who helped de Villiers to stitch a crucial century stand. Earlier, Naveed provided the breakthrough by dismissing Amla with a short ball. Rossouw looked in good touch against the seamers, but was all at sea against the off-spinner, Mohammad Tauqir, and was dismissed by Tauqir. de Kock too didn't last long. However, de Villiers yet again came to their rescue.AB de Villiers played with sparkle and fizz to help South Africa recover after they found themselves in a tricky position and eventually, Proteas notched up a massive total. After South Africa lost the wickets of Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock and Rilee Rossouw, de Villiers steadied their innings. He then looked to up the ante by lofting Mohammad Tauqir for a six over extra cover. In the slog overs, he clouted Mohammad Naveed for a couple of boundaries and followed it up by hoisting a juicy full toss from Amjad Javed over deep square-leg for a six. He also used the crease to keep the spinners guessing. Unfortunately for de Villiers, he was dismissed for 99. Once de Villiers was dismissed, Farhaan Behardien played a quick-fire knock.South Africa scored 40 runs in the last two overs and it has helped them go past the 340-mark.4
SOUTH AFRICA:49.6 Amjad Javed to Behardien, FOUR, top shot! Full and around off, Behardien moves to the leg-side, gives a bit of room and tonks it inside out over extra cover, no chance for sweeper or long-off to stop that. A very expensive over to end the innings, 25 runs came off it

SOUTH AFRICA:46.6 Naveed to Duminy, out Lbw!! Timely wicket for UAE. Duminy could have been destructive at this stage of the innings. Naveed rewarded for keeping it full and straight. The only doubt was if it was missing the off-stump, Duminy missed the clip and was struck on the back pad. Umpire Tucker took his time before raising his finger. Hawk-Eye confirms that the on-field umpire had got it right. Duminy lbw b Naveed 23(28) [4s-1]Naveed to Duminy, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Duminy has been given out LBW. He reviews it. Naveed is fine with the no-ball. It seems pretty good. There is no inside edge. Remember it should be missing the stumps. Even clipping won't help Duminy. He is hit on the back pad. Hawk-Eye shows it pitched in-line and is hitting off-stump. He is OUT!

That is bad news for UAE as he was bowling well. He was not able to walk even though he was being helped by his mates. So, a ground ambulance takes him away. Shaiman Anwar to complete the over..

SOUTH AFRICA:33.1 Alhashmi to de Villiers, no run, back of a length outside off, de Villiers walks across his stumps and toe-ends the punch to coverIt could have been worse, but Saqlain Haider, the wicket-keeper, missed a run out chance and David Miller survived. In fact, Haider has been poor behind the stumps. Miller survived another chance as he was dropped by Tauqir off Fahad Alhashmi. It was South Africa's captain, AB de Villiers, who calmed down the nerves in the South African camp by playing an inside-out shot to smash Tauqir for a six. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 17 overs: Mohammad Tauqir continued to trouble Rilee Rossouw and snaffled his wicket. Rossouw looked all at sea against Tauqir. Tauqir was getting a bit of drift, but Rossouw looked out of his depth against deliveries that just went straight on and gave a simple caught and bowled chance to the off-spinner and was dismissed. Rossouw isn't exactly known for his ability to play spin well. Time for the drinks break.

SOUTH AFRICA:16.1 M Tauqir to Rossouw, no run, flighted delivery on middle stump line, Rossouw works it towards short mid-wicketAB de Villiers, right handed bat, comes to the creaseIt was Rilee Rossouw, who took advantage of a couple of short deliveries to give South Africa the impetus after they lost the wicket of Amla. He also essayed fine shots down the ground off Kamran Shahzad. On the other hand, the out of form, Quinton de Kock, struggled to make an impact, before he thumped Shazad for a few boundaries. de Kock certainly likes to free his arms and hit on the up. For UAE, Mohammad Tauqir with subtle variations of drift troubled the batsmen. It was Amjad Javed, who then dismissed de Kock.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 16 overs: Mohammad Naveed made the crucial breakthrough by snaring the wicket of Hashim Amla. Amla, in an attempt to force the issue, tried to play a pull shot. However, Naveed proved his worth by bowling it outside the off-stump, and that resulted in Amla getting a leading edge and was dismissed. Naveed flicks his wrist and can surprise the batsman for a bit of pace.Drinks are on the field now

Naveed will open the bowling, with Hashim Amla taking the strike first up. Here we go then...The players line-up for the national anthems. First, it is the UAE national anthem that is being played, followed by the South African anthem.Pitch Report: "There is quite a bit of grass, but it is dead grass. The pitch is hard and it is not going to change much throughout the day. The bowlers will be happy as well, as the wind is not going to be blowing so much. I don't think the toss will play a role," reckons Mpumelelo MbangwaTeams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirUnited Arab Emirates (Playing XI): Amjad Ali, Andri Berenger, Khurram Khan, Shaiman Anwar, Swapnil Patil, Saqlain Haider(w), Amjad Javed, Mohammad Naveed, Mohammad Tauqir(c), Fahad Alhashmi, Kamran ShazadUnited Arab Emirates have won the toss and have opted to fieldTauqir: "We have performed decently well. We have a couple of more games and everyone is keen to do well and play some positive cricket. We will bowl first. It seems to be a good wicket, we have a couple of good fast bowlers in our side and we want to bowl first and put them under pressure. There is no particular target in mind. We would like to bowl and field well and put them under pressure. We've got three changes in our side. We've got Kamran Shahzad, Fahad Alhashmi and a new batsman-keeper Saqlain Haider."de Villiers: "Not different, pretty much the same (asked about preparation for this game). The guys are working really hard at their game, making sure that we give ourselves the best opportunity to perform. So it went very well, couple of days at the Basin Reserve, very nice, pretty ground. All good and we are set to go to play some good cricket today. It's a good opportunity for our batters to once again score some runs and get into good form and hopefully set a good total for them to chase down. A solid game of cricket will give us some confidence. Like I said, few runs for the batters would be great and obviously some wickets for the bowlers. Just play a good game of cricket. If we do come out on top here, then we will start thinking about the knockout stage. We want to play a good game of cricket. Behardien comes in for du Plessis, Philander makes his comeback and Abbott misses out today."The toss is not far away folks. Let's be very frank, South Africa are clear favourites to win this contest. What will AB de Villiers do if he wins the toss? South Africa have lost both their games chasing a target. Will he look to chase and test his batsmen out before the knockout games? Knowing this, will Mohammad Tauqir want to bat and post a score and test South Africa out? We'll get the answers shortly. Stay tuned...Weather Report: There was some rain expected for this game, but fortunately the conditions are bright and sunny. It might get a little cloudy later on, but we should get a full game in. With the maximum temperature expected to hover around 21 degrees Celsius, the weather should be perfect for playing cricket.Team changes: Vernon Philander is expected to be fit for this game, while Faf du Plessis is a doubtful starter, with him struggling with a lower-back stiffness. Will South Africa push Rilee Rossouw up the order and drop out of form Quinton de Kock? That would mean that AB de Villiers will keep wickets. Meanwhile, UAE could probably take this opportunity to try out some of the players who haven't played in the competition yet."The way they are going, they're scoring 400 runs against West Indies and Ireland. I think we need to bowl well, need to field well to restrict them. We will be putting in a lot of effort against South Africa," said captain Mohammad Tauqir.On the other hand, UAE have been winless so far in the competition. Despite putting in a spirited show against Zimbabwe, they failed to capture key moments and lost their tournament opener. It was a case of so near yet so far for UAE against Ireland as they let William Porterfield & Co. to register a come-from-behind win in Brisbane. A few days later, they were a no contest to India, but with a gritty performance with the bat, despite losing the match, they ensured that Pakistan could not bowl them out. Shaiman Anwar has stolen all the limelight. Batting lower down the order, he has impressed one and all and is one of the top run-getters in the tournament. The problem for UAE though is that they have managed to piece together a solid package. If they can run South Africa close today, it would be a great achievement.Meanwhile, talking ahead of this match, de Villiers said that his side is treating this as a must-win game. "It's a very important game. We have to win it. It's not a 'maybe we'll win it' kind of game. It's a must-win for us. We'd really like to get to eight points and make sure we finish second in the group, that's the plan for now. We've got to win our game first, otherwise we might actually play Australia in Adelaide.""We just didn't play really good cricket today. I thought we were right with the ball in hand and shocking with the bat. I expect us to get more partnerships going from the top seven batters. It's never nice to lose games of cricket, I am not going to be happy with that," said a disappointed de Villiers after the match.AB de Villiers opted to bowl in overcast conditions in Auckland. Although his bowlers managed to get only one early wicket, they came back strongly and bowled out Pakistan for 222. In reply, with Faf du Plessis and Hashim Amla recovering well from the early loss of Quinton de Dock, South Africa were well on course for an easy victory, but some inspirational bowling from Pakistan saw them lose 4 wickets in a space of 10 runs. Captain de Villiers though threatened to take the game away with a brisk fifty, but lack of support from the other end meant Pakistan went on to win a thrilling contest.There is no doubt that South Africa is one of the strongest teams on paper, if not the strongest in the competition. After seeing off Zimbabwe in their tournament opener, the Proteas went down to India at the MCG in their next encounter. They recovered very well and registered thumping wins over West Indies and Ireland. However, they suffered a shocking loss at the hands of Pakistan in their most recent fixture. The fact that they have lost to two main teams in Pool B is a bit of a concern, especially after being tagged as "favourites" to win the World Cup this time around.Now let's get back to present and take a look at how both teams have fared thus far in the 2015 World Cup.Moving on to Kirsten's marathon innings, it was Zarawani who chose to bowl first thinking that the ball would assist the seamers because of some moisture on the pitch caused by overnight rain. However, UAE's bowlers did not justify the captain's call as South Africa scored freely. Opener Gary Kirsten reached 50 off 51 balls, 100 off 105 balls and his next 50 runs came off just 30 balls. Eventually, Kirsten hit 13 fours and 4 sixes, before finishing unbeaten on 188 - then the highest ever individual score in a World Cup game - surpassing Viv Richards' 181* against Sri Lanka in 1987. Kirsten's effort was then second highest ODI score of all time, next to Viv Richards' 189. South Africa posted 321/2 - their highest ever ODI score then - and registered an easy victory.Donald ran in and banged it short, albeit with an intention to bounce it over the batsman, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a well-directed bumper and Zarawani got hit flush on the head as he took his eyes off the ball. It was a pacy delivery and it almost rolled back to the bowler after hitting the batsman. With Zarawani holding his head, a worried Donald rushed to check his health and much to the delight of everyone, Zarawani was fine to continue. Symcox though suggested Donald to bowl another bouncer, to which the latter responded, "There's no way I'm bowling him another bouncer." Recalling the incident later, Zarawani said it was stupid of him not to wear a helmet, while Donald admitted that he thought he had killed the batsman.It was UAE's captain Sultan Zarawani, who was making his way out to the middle with grey coloured floppy hat. This took the South Africans by surprise. To make it even more intriguing, Zarawani, a wealthy man, with a slew of expensive cars at his disposal, had reportedly promised every cricketer in that squad a Mercedes Benz, if they defeated a heavyweight in the mega-event. Jonty Rhodes had heard about Zarawani's promise and had reminded Donald of it during the break. Off-spinner Pat Symcox, who was fielding as a substitute, provoked Donald to bowl a bouncer.When you think of South Africa v UAE, you remember two things. One, is Allan Donald's bouncer to Sultan Zarawani and the other is Gary Kirsten's record-breaking 188*. Both happened on February 16 in Rawalpindi, during the 1996 World Cup. Let's rewind to the first incident. Chasing a mammoth total, UAE were reduced to 68/6. After the Proteas finished their celebrations on dismissing Johanne Samarasekara, everyone was surprised to see a batsman walk without a helmet against Allan "White lightning" Donald.PreviewSouth Africa will want consistency and commitment in their final league game against the United Arab Emirates on Thursday. The Proteas will be aware that their stop-start form cannot continue as the tournament's knockout phase looms. At their best, de Villiers' men have looked like world beaters, becoming the first team in history to post successive one-day international totals of 400-plus in Pool B wins over the West Indies and Ireland. On the downside, they have been skittled out for 177 and 202 in losses to India and Pakistan respectively, reviving memories of the hated "chokers" tag that has haunted previous ICC Cricket World Cup campaigns.Team News:South Africa:With a quarter-final against a dangerous Sri Lanka appearing likely, the UAE match presents a final chance for some South African fine-tuning. It also has the potential to provide crucial practice for seamer Vernon Philander, who has missed the past three games with a hamstring injury. In his absence, Kyle Abbott has been impressive - taking eight wickets at an impressive average of 12.87.The World Cup hopefuls will hope Quinton de Kock hits form ahead of the knock-out stages. The team think-tank could also look at getting the in-form Rilee Russouw to bat up top in place of the wicket-keeper, leaving AB de Villiers to take up wicket-keeping duties. This could allow them to play an all-rounder in Wayne Parnell and clear up their fifth bowler conundrum.There could also be space for left-armer Aaron Phangiso - To give Imran Tahir a rest.Probable XI: Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock/Rilee Russouw, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers (capt), David Miller, JP Duminy, Wayne Parnell, Vernon Philander/Kyle Abbott, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Aaron Phangiso.Player to watch out for: AB de Villiers - The South Africa captain has been in stellar form, and against a below-par UAE attack could come out all guns blazing. His batting apart, the South African has also been bowling regularly for the Proteas, and has picked up a couple of wickets. He could be seen with the ball should SA choose the same set-up for the UAE game.UAE:The amateurs of the UAE, many of them Pakistani expatriates, are winless so far in the tournament and should not present a hurdle if South Africa are anywhere near their best. They did start their World Cup campaign on a positive note, giving Zimbabwe and Ireland a run for their money. UAE's best performance so far was a gutsy two-wicket loss to fellow non-Test nation Ireland. They have however struggled to make a big impact against the big teams like India and Pakistan, and will hope to give themselves a game to savour.Probable XI: Amjad Ai, Andri Berenger, Krishna Chandran, Khurram Khan, Shaiman Anwar, Swapnil Patel, Rohan Mustafa, Amjad Javed, Mohammad Naveed, Mohammad Tauqir (capt), Manjula Guruge.Player to watch out for: Shaiman Anwar - The middle-order batsman is in a rich vein of form - one that saw him claim the top spot on the run makers list at one point - having scored one hundred and two fifties in the four games UAE have played so far. Against an attack that South Africa boast of, UAE will need Anwar to be at his best. He has, so far, scored 270 runs in four matches, at a brilliant average of 67.50.Stats and Trivia:UAE and South Africa have met each other once before, with South Africa claiming a 169-run win during the 1996 World Cup.South Africa became the first side in ODI history to score in excess of 400 in two successive innings.Quotes:AB de Villiers - We need to have a chat about what maybe went wrong (against Pakistan)... and try to get to fifth gear again against the UAE.Mohammed Tauqir - The way they are going, they're scoring 400 runs against West Indies and Ireland. I think we need to bowl well, need to field well to restrict them. We will be putting in a lot of effort against South Africa.Teams:United Arab Emirates (From): Amjad Ali, Andri Berenger, Krishnachandran Karate, Khurram Khan, Shaiman Anwar, Swapnil Patil(k), Rohan Mustafa, Amjad Javed, Mohammad Naveed, Mohammad Tauqir(c), Manjula Guruge, Nasir Aziz, Fahad Alhashmi, Kamran Shazad, Saqlain HaiderSouth Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(k), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Dale Steyn, Kyle Abbott, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Farhaan Behardien, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Phangiso, Vernon PhilanderLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
