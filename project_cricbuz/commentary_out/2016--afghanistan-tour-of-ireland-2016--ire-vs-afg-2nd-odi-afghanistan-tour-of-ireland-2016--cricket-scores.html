IRELAND:47.3 Rashid Khan to Chase, 1 run, chipped through mid-on this
IRELAND:47.2 Rashid Khan to Murtagh, 1 run, drags this sweep off the inner half to backward square leg. A single but it won't suffice in the larger scheme of things

IRELAND:45.4 Nabi to Dockrell, out Caught by Rashid Khan!! Only fair as Dockrell tries to go big. Doesn't time it too well and finds long-on to perfection. Dockrell c Rashid Khan b Nabi 6(13)Nabi to Dockrell, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

Sun has just started to pop out, welcome sign!The players are walking out towards the centre for the National Anthems of both countries. It's the Afghan anthem first followed by the Irish one.Teams:Ireland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, John Anderson, Ed Joyce, Kevin O'Brien, Stuart Poynter(w), Andy McBrine, George Dockrell, Barry McCarthy, Peter Chase, Tim MurtaghAfghanistan (Playing XI): Asghar Stanikzai(c), Mohammad Shahzad(w), Mirwais Ashraf, Dawlat Zadran, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Najibullah Zadran, Javed Ahmadi, Rahmat Shah, Shapoor ZadranIreland have won the toss and have opted to field10:06 Local Time, 09:06 GMT, 14:36 IST: The good news is that after all that rain for the past couple of days, finally the sun is out and we are expecting that the game will be starting on time. However, it will be interesting to see how much water has the outfield taken and has it dried enough to be not a concern for the outfielders?09:50 Local Time, 08:50 GMT, 14:20 IST: Hello all! The five-match ODI series between Ireland and Afghanistan did not get off to the best of starts with the rain gods playing spoilsport, leading to the first match being abandoned without a ball being bowled. Afghanistan are in good form leading up to the start of the series. This is another opportunity for them to show that they are here to stay. There is a lot at stake for both teams as series is up for grabs and one can be rest assured that remaining four ODIs are likely to be evenly-matched encounters. Stay tuned for toss and team updates..Preview:After a frustrating rain-abandoned game two days ago, both Ireland and Afghanistan will be looking for a winning start in the second of the five-match One-Day International series, atthe Civil Service Cricket Club in Belfast on Tuesday (July 12).Hosts Ireland have a slight edge over the Asian side when it comes to the 50-over format. Their head-to-head record stands at 3-1, but given the recent form, Afghanistan look a better team on paper. The Asghar Stanikzai-led side hasn't lost the last three bilateral series that they have been involved in, while Ireland haven't won one since 2014.The form of Mohammad Shahzad, Rahmat Shah, Mohammad Nabi and Najibullah Zadran played a key role in Afghanistan winning the two-match ODI series against Scotland 1-0, with the other game being called off due to rain. However, Noor Ali Zadran's struggle at the top of the order and Stanikzai's run-drought is a cause of concern for the tourists.The bowling, on the other hand, looks versatile and well-balanced. Dawlat Zadran, Shapoor Zadran, Nabi and Rashid Khan were among the wickets during the Scotland series. Rashid Khan, the leg-spinner, has grown in confidence with each passing game since the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, where he was the pick of the Afghanistan bowlers. Hamid Hassan, who missed the second ODI against Scotland, is most likely to replace Shapoor.A depleted Ireland side will aim to kick-start the series with a win. The hosts are without some of their key players, Niall O'Brien injured his calf muscle during the Sri Lanka series, while Boyd Rankin has county commitments. Peter Chase, the right-arm fast bowler, has been roped in to replace Rankin, while George Dockrell, who was left out of the squad initially, was called back to cover for Mark Adair.The batting will mainly depend on the top three - William Porterfield, Paul Stirling and Ed Joyce. All three batsmen have been in good form for their respective county sides and Ireland will want them to replicate that form for the country. Kevin O'Brien had decent outings against Sri Lanka and the hosts will hope for the same from the stockily built all-rounder.When: Tuesday, July 12, 10:45 AM Local Time (3:15 PM IST)Where: Civil Service Cricket Club, BelfastWhat to expect: Rain played showstopper in the first game, where even the toss didn't take place. The forecast is not much different for Tuesday. Showers are expected throughout the day, but the precipitation percentage suggests we might get a shortened game.Team News:Ireland: The hosts are without the services of Rankin, who misses out due to his county commitments. Young all-rounder Mark Adair was given his maiden call-up, but he withdrew from the series because of a back injury. George Dockrell, the left-arm spinner, comes in to the squad, while Mark Sorensen is kept on standby.Afghanistan: The Asian side might not tinker much with the team that won them the second ODI against Scotland. The top and middle-order looks set and the only change that may happen is Shapoor Zadran making way for Hamid Hassan.Teams:Afghanistan (From): Samiullah Shenwari, Najibullah Zadran, Rashid Khan, Mirwais Ashraf, Gulbadin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Mohammad Shahzad(w), Noor Ali Zadran, Javed Ahmadi, Asghar Stanikzai(c), Rahmat Shah, Mohammad Nabi, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor Zadran, Amir Hamza, Yamin AhmadzaiIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Mark Richard Adair, John Anderson, Peter Chase, Ed Joyce, Tyrone Kane, Andy McBrine, Barry McCarthy, Tim Murtagh, Kevin O'Brien, Stuart Poynter(w), Paul Stirling, Sean Terry, Gary WilsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
