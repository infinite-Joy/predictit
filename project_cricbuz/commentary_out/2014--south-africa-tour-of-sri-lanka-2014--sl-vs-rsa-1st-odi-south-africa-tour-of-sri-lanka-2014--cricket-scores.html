The visitors started off very well with Amla and de Kock sharing their 5th 50+ stand in ODIs. Though they lost the latter and Kallis in quick succession, the skipper and Amla batted sensibly and added 151 runs for the third wicket. Amla completed his 13th ODI hundred before being dismissed. In the end, a quick-fire 55-run stand between Miller and McLaren propelled the Proteas past 300. In fact, they did really well to steal 43 runs off the last 18 balls. The pitch is flat, good for batting and the hosts will fancy their chances too. Join us back for the Sri Lankan reply.4

The Proteas begin their campaign with a 3-match ODI series, which will be followed by a couple of Test matches. The visitors have had a good start to the tour winning their practice game against Sri Lanka Board President's XI.
