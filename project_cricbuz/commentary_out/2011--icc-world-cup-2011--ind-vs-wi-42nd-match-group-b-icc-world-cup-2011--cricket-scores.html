In all likelihood, it looks like India are going to wrap this up. Sarwan is still there, but with the req rate mounting, a win looks a distant dream.
WEST INDIES:37.6  Munaf Patel to Benn, no run, back of a length and around the off stump, Benn gets behind the line and defends it down the wicket, shouts WAIT in that typical West Indies accent

West Indies look good to win against India and bring Sri Lanka to Motera to play their quarter-final against India. They are pacing the chase well. The Indian bowling attack doesn't have any potency. No bite for the spinners and it needed a poor delivery from Raina to get Darren Bravo out. West Indies still don't know the status about Pollard's injury, though he is seen sitting in the dressing room.

WEST INDIES:16.6  Raina to Darren Bravo, out Caught by Harbhajan!! MS' master-stroke has paid off. Rubbish delivery, probably the worst delivery that Raina would've bowled in his life. Rank half-tracker, Raina landed it in his own half. The ball came slowly to Darren Bravo who spotted that juicy gift, his eyes lit up and his brain would have been giving signals where to hit it. Amidst all this, Darren Bravo's bat came down, and in the end, his pull landed in Harbie's lap at long on. Raina pumps his fist. Darren Bravo has fallen to some soft dismissals in this tournament, this might the softest of them all. He takes a long time before walking back. Darren Bravo c Harbhajan b Raina 22(29) [4s-1 6s-1] Raina to Darren Bravo, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

WEST INDIES:11.6  Harbhajan to Smith, wide, well looped up, but outside leg, wide called
WEST INDIES:11.5  Harbhajan to Smith, FOUR!!, Smith is picking Harbhajan well, rocks back, sees the toppie from the hand and employs the short arm jab pull, Tendulkar at deep mid wicket is way too wide and the ball slowly trickles away into the ropes, the West Indians are doing it easily, MS looks a tad worried

WEST INDIES:9.3  Harbhajan to Smith, no run, tossed up on off, pushed back to HarbhajanSome fun: Yuvraj is off the field. He was suffering from dehydration and threw up a couple of times. Nehra is sitting next to him in the dressing room and as the camera flashes on them, he gently plays with Yuvraj's hands. Yuvraj shoos him away with a smile.

WEST INDIES:6.2  Ashwin to Edwards, out Lbw!! The Chennai crowd cheer for the local boy has struck. A very good review too. The carrom ball or the one that Ashwin flicks it with the palm facing the batsman. He rolls this, using the 2 fingers of his hand to flick it, it lands just on leg, bamboozles Edwards completely, he was looking to shuffle across and tuck it. The ball moved past his bat and hit the pad. To the naked eye it looked plumb. The third ump confirmed the same. Lovely variations from Ashwin who bowls that delivery well. The Barbadian walks back. Edwards lbw b Ashwin 17(17) [4s-1 6s-1] Ashwin to Edwards, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Review time: Before anything else, I should say that Steve Davis has not got one decision wrong when it has gone for the UDRS. Original decision was not-out.

Taufel was in an excellent position as well. Why he did not go upstairs is the million dollar question. Edwards was a couple of inches or a foot short at least. It flashed on the big screen and that makes it even worse for Taufel. A glaring error. One of the best umpires in the world and he makes a mistake. Time to move on though.

WEST INDIES:3.6  Zaheer to Smith, no run, chopped hard, but gets it into the ground at short cover
WEST INDIES:3.5  Zaheer to Smith, no run, What has happened here? Seems like Kohli has run-out Edwards, a muted appeal and Simon Taufel who was near the non-striker had a look at it, he did not go upstairs, Kohli appealed, the rest of the Indian members did not go up in unision, it hit direct and Edwards was well short, unbelievable
WEST INDIES:3.4  Zaheer to Smith, FOUR!!, Smith nailed that. Absolutely gave it the full monty. Got forward and drove it powerfully past Edwards, the ball went away to the fence at the rate of knots, showed the high front elbow and a full face of the bat to boot

WEST INDIES:2.3  Ashwin to Edwards, FOUR!!, looking at the cover drive, this Edwards looks a good player, a regulation overpitched delivery outside off, he leant forward and drove it wide of a sprawling cover man, the ball purred across the turf, beating the man, hit all along the ground

WEST INDIES:1.3  Zaheer to Edwards, 1 run, the crowd roar and it is for a simple piece of fielding from Sachin at mid off, Edwards drove it wide of him and gets his first runs in ODI cricket, Tony Cozier on air: He is a demi-god in a country of such passionate cricket fans.
WEST INDIES:1.2  Zaheer to Smith, 1 run, tapped past short mid wicket to get Edwards on strike
WEST INDIES:1.1  Zaheer to Smith, no run, short and wide outside off, cut away hard, but straight to the fielder at backward point, Kohli fields well

WEST INDIES:0.1  Ashwin to Smith, no run, tucked down to short fine, Ashwin is coming from round the wicket straightawaySmith and Edwards are at the crease. Smith is on strike. Ashwin will open the attackStart of the chase: All set for the West Indian reply. Yet another Indian batting collapse - which has seen their last 7 wickets fall for 50 runs. If India win today then they will face Australia in the quarter-finals, if they lose then it will be the Lankans. A spinner and it will be the local boy - Ravichandran Ashwin - in his first World Cup game will be opening the bowling. Kirk Edwards - similarly another debutant from Barbados is at the non-strikers end.Chepauk was stunned into silence after Sachin walked back in the first over and it needed Yuvraj and Kohli to put up a very good partnership to put the Indian innings back on track. Yuvraj in particular batted quite brilliantly battling dehydration and a pitch that had some awkward bounce to bring up his first WC ton. Ravi Rampaul was the wrecker-in-chief for WI and got a thoroughly deserved five wicket haul. The late collapse in consecutive games is a cause of worry and the much vaunted batting line up is showing signs of vulnerability. The total is a tricky one on this pitch and the depleted WI batting line up will have their task cut out when Harbhajan and Ashwin come in to bowl. It promises to be an engrossing chase and join us in a short while for it..Rampaul: Worked hard to get this five wicket haul, I had my doubts of getting a game in with the bowling unit performing well, Roachy fell ill and I got a chance. I tried yorkers and also some variations, it worked out for me. The batsmen should go out there and assess the conditions. This crowd is awesome, they are cheering good cricket.4
INDIA:49.1  Russell to Munaf Patel, out Bowled!! The End! Short of a length and angled in from wide of the crease, Munaf Patel backs away looking to target the third man region, an under edge and the ball goes back onto the stumps, another ugly collapse from the Men in Blue.

INDIA:48.5  Rampaul to Zaheer, out Bowled!! A five wicket haul for Rampaul, career best figures for him and well deserved. He has been terrific today with his variations, this was another yorker length delivery, the Indian lower middle order batsmen don't have any answers for those kinda deliveries. Zaheer b Rampaul 5(3) [4s-1] Rampaul to Zaheer, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:48.4  Rampaul to Zaheer, FOUR!!, Take that! Zaheer clears the front leg and drives it through extra cover, absolutely creamed it, much to the delight of the 50,000 odd crowd!

INDIA:47.5  Russell to Harbhajan, out Caught by Pollard!! What a catch! Spectacular! Harbhajan was early into the shot, it was a low full toss and he ended up scooping it to long on, Pollard was running towards the ball which was dying on him, dives forward and takes it inches off the ground, looks like he has dislocated his finger, calls for the physio straight away, looks ok though, but that was surely one of the best catches of the tournament. Harbhajan c Pollard b Russell 3(6) Russell to Harbhajan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:47.4  Russell to Ashwin, 1 run, short, raising delivery, Ashwin stands on his toes and fends it to the on side, every run matters

INDIA:47.2  Russell to Ashwin, 1 run, wonderful shot but equally well fielded by Bishoo, Ashwin made room and square drove it wide of cover point, the fielder dives to his left and keeps it down to one
INDIA:47.1  Russell to Ashwin, FOUR!!, it doesn't matter how they come, stood low a bit, took an inside edge, misses the off stump, beats Devon Thomas who dives to his left, and the ball goes rocketing into the fine leg fenceThe umpires are not happy with the ball, they are changing it, another delay in play. The innings was supposed to end at 6:00 PM IST. And they are left with three more overs to bowl.
INDIA:46.6  Rampaul to Harbhajan, no run, that one cut back in sharply, rushes through Harbhajan's defense as he was hopping on the backfoot
INDIA:46.5  Rampaul to Ashwin, 1 run, a direct hit and Ashwin would have been a goner! Pushed that to mid off, straight to Sammy and set off for a single, the fielder had all three stumps to aim at, he misses, he hasn't had a good day todayRavichandran Ashwin, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:46.4  Rampaul to Yusuf Pathan, out Bowled!! Rampaul's good day continues!

INDIA:45.1  Russell to Yusuf Pathan, FOUR!!, third man is up and that's a cheeky little beginning to the batting powerplay, close to the body, he just arches back and uses the pace on that delivery to glide it down to third man, the ball races away, the Chennai crowd go crazy after a silent phaseAndre Russell [7.0-1-31-0] is back into the attackHarbhajan Singh, right handed bat, comes to the creaseThe batting powerplay has been taken. Well they had to, it's mandatory now.
INDIA:44.6  Pollard to Yuvraj, out Caught&Bowled!! The celebrations by Pollard tells how frustrated he was and how relieved he is. Yuvraj ends up chipping it straight back to the bowler, was foxed by the slower delivery, a soft dismissal in the end. Yuvraj c and b Pollard 113(123) [4s-10 6s-2] Pollard to Yuvraj, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!
INDIA:44.5  Pollard to Yusuf Pathan, 1 run, short, around the off stump and thereabouts, glided down to third man as he stands on his toesPollard runs in, Yuvraj backs away since the fielder at mid off was moving, that's not pleasing Pollard, he has been an angry man today. Don't be surprised if he gets some big hits going when he comes out to bat.
INDIA:44.4  Pollard to Yuvraj, 1 run, pushed square of the wicket on the off side, just a single
INDIA:44.3  Pollard to Yuvraj, 2 runs, width on offer, crunched through cover, good effort in th deep by Darren Bravo, runs wide and slides at the right time

INDIA:43.6  Sammy to Yusuf Pathan, no run, fuller and angled in, Yusuf Pathan plays it to mid on with soft hands, a bit of a misunderstanding between the two, they don't take the single in the end

I'm (Srivathsa) not in the best of form today and so will have some lunch and try to get back into top gear for the West Indian chase. The players ever so slowly walk back to the middle. That's expected on such a hot day.
INDIA:16.6  Sammy to Yuvraj, 1 run, Pollard is an athlete and he shows us why, any other fielder and it might have been 4, cut away past cover point and Pollard sweeping on the sweeper cover fence, moves swiftly and keeps it to a single.

INDIA:15.1  Devendra Bishoo to Yuvraj, no run, turns it to short mid wicketDevendra Bishoo, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackBishoo - the impressive Guyanese leggie comes on now. No one close to the bat as he comes in to bowl.
INDIA:14.6  Sammy to Yuvraj, 1 run, mid on, which was Sarwan dived over the ball and let it go, mid off - I guess it was Rampaul stopped it with his left boot and saved 3 runs, it was sweetly on driven by Yuvraj too
INDIA:14.5  Sammy to Yuvraj, no run, nice looking shot for no runs, punched straight to the fielder at cover
INDIA:14.4  Sammy to Yuvraj, FOUR!!, not a well timed pull, but the outfield is very quick, once it got past Devon Smith at square leg, it raced away, Yuvraj dragged it from outside off

INDIA:13.4  Russell to Yuvraj, no run, Yuvraj played slightly outside the line of that ball and ends up edging it onto his pads, it was outside off as well
INDIA:13.3  Russell to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli plays those tucks/clips well, another one of those, down to deep square leg
INDIA:13.2  Russell to Yuvraj, 1 run, tapped to the vacant short leg, Kohli hares across to make it to the other end

INDIA:12.6 Sammy to Yuvraj, no run, 2nd time in two overs that Sammy has dropped Yuvraj, though this was a very difficult chance, Yuvraj closed the bat face early, the leading edge went high and Sammy leapt high, just about got a finger on that, he needed to be Big Benn to catch that. Sammy just could not grab it with his right hand.

INDIA:12.1  Sammy to Kohli, no run, full and on off, Kohli gets forward and pushes it to mid onDarren Sammy, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackNow the man - Sammy - who dropped Yuvraj comes on. Will he make up for it? Sammy is a good fielder, the thing he did wrong was he reacted late. Leapt a fraction late and by that time it was too late.
INDIA:11.6 Russell to Yuvraj, 2 runs, Sammy who had moved out of slip a couple of balls ago has dropped Yuvraj here, once again Yuvraj is caught in a tangle, unsure whether to leave the short ball alone or not, it was angled across him and he stabbed at it with a cross bat, the ball went to the left of Sammy at point, who was late to react and just about palms it away down to third man, if Pollard was there, he would've had a much better chance to catch that, a let-off for Yuvraj
INDIA:11.5  Russell to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli goes on the backfoot and uses the depth of his crease to nudge it wide of square leg
INDIA:11.4  Russell to Kohli, no run, short delivery and not well directed though, down leg and Thomas goes to his left to collect
INDIA:11.3  Russell to Yuvraj, 1 run, now Russell errs on the pads of Yuvraj who closes the face of the bat to get it down to fine leg

INDIA:10.3  Rampaul to Yuvraj, FOUR!!, Emphatic, Yuvraj picks this waist high short ball and then rocks back to power a pull past square leg, that was hit with disdain and as Ian Bishop says, Yuvraj will take on the short delivery if Rampaul does not get it right
INDIA:10.2  Rampaul to Yuvraj, no run, head high bouncer, it is outside off, Yuvraj went for the hook and the ball went past the bat in a flash, Yuvraj was late on the shot as the ball went through to Thomas
INDIA:10.1  Rampaul to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli is playing the short and the short of length deliveries well, hops back and tucks it with the angle down to deep squar
INDIA:9.6  Russell to Yuvraj, no run, in the corridor of uncertainty, Yuvraj shoulders arms
INDIA:9.5  Russell to Yuvraj, no run, Russell and the Windies have a definite plan not to pitch anything up to Yuvraj, a short delivery rising onto off stump, Yuvraj tries to ride the bounce, hops back, the bat face closes as he defends and it goes to the vacant short leg area, a single is turned down
INDIA:9.4  Russell to Yuvraj, no run, full and wide outside off, Yuvraj has no trouble in letting that go

INDIA:9.2  Russell to Yuvraj, no run, more confidently played off the backfoot, pushed to the off side
INDIA:9.1  Russell to Yuvraj, no run, that's awkwardly played by Yuvraj, the short delivery angled across him, Yuvraj was a tad squared up and ends up fending at it, the ball is played softly, so it dies down quickly too
INDIA:8.6  Rampaul to Kohli, no run, full and angling in, Kohli turns it from off stump, to short mid wicket
INDIA:8.5  Rampaul to Kohli, 2 runs, takes it from middle and wrists it with a closed face to deep square leg for a couple

INDIA:8.3  Rampaul to Gambhir, out Caught by Russell at third man!! That's how his Delhi mate - Sehwag used to get out often in ODIs. Now it's Gambhir's turn. Skipped down the track, it was banged in short, Gambhir was cramped for room, yet went through with the slash, it went straight down the throat of Russel who made no mistake. India are two down. Enter Yuvraj. Good bowling from Rampaul to follow Gambhir even as the batsman tried to create his own room. Rampaul loved it and sends off Gambhir with a loud celebration. Gambhir c Russell b Rampaul 22(26) [4s-4] Rampaul to Gambhir, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:8.2  Rampaul to Gambhir, no run, Gambhir tries to chop it down to third man, the bottom edge rolls on the bounce to the keeper
INDIA:8.1  Rampaul to Kohli, 1 run, tucked past square leg, taken from off and middle stump line, easy run
INDIA:7.6  Russell to Gambhir, byes, FOUR!!, sharp short delivery, and before Gambhir could complete his pull, the ball flew past his bat and over Thomas' head, who got a finger tip on it, parried it over the bar and Russell isn't impressed with that effort, the 50 is up as well for India
INDIA:7.5  Russell to Gambhir, no run, full and angled across Gambhir who leans into the drive and finds cover, straight to the fielder
INDIA:7.4  Russell to Kohli, 1 run, well played, the short delivery and rearing up on Kohli who went back and rode the bounce, tapped it wide of short mid wicket and an easy single is pinched

INDIA:5.6  Benn to Kohli, 1 run, it could well have been 3 in a row, but for some sharp fielding at cover point, cut away fiercely and the fielder did well to make a half stop, Kohli retains the strike with that run
INDIA:5.5  Benn to Kohli, FOUR!!, another one for Kohli, much more forceful this time, half volley as well and Kohli got forward before cracking it through cover, easily done
INDIA:5.4  Benn to Kohli, FOUR!!, beautiful shot, graceful stuff from Kohli, it was slanted across him, he leant forward and drove it wide of cover, just concentrated on timing and he got the placement right too
INDIA:5.3  Benn to Kohli, no run, again tries to play the cut and ends up bottom edging it onto the ground

INDIA:5.1  Benn to Gambhir, 1 run, driven to long on
INDIA:4.6  Rampaul to Gambhir, 1 run, tight single, pushed to mid off and both men had to rush across to make it, wrong end as well, if the throw had gone to Gambhir's end he might have been struggling
INDIA:4.5  Rampaul to Gambhir, FOUR!!, edged and if this is a test match, Gambhir might have well been walking back to the pavilion, playing away from his body and there is only one slip, it would have been a dolly to the 4th slip man, Gambhir is lucky and gets away with a boundary
INDIA:4.4  Rampaul to Gambhir, no run, back to basics, back of a length delivery and Gambhir gets right behind the line to block
INDIA:4.3  Rampaul to Gambhir, no run, play and a miss, another ripper of a short delivery, rising outside off, Gambhir has a flat footed poke at that, no footwork and tried to slash it away, he missed and the ball thudded into Thomas' mitts

INDIA:4.1  Rampaul to Kohli, 1 run, on the middle and leg line, whipped away to backward square leg
INDIA:3.6  Benn to Gambhir, no run, now uses the feet and drives it back to Benn who threatens to throw it back at Gambhir, Gambhir has a wry smile on his face
INDIA:3.5  Benn to Gambhir, FOUR!!, that's how you play the spinners, use the feet and then allow the spinner to drop it short, if he does, then rock back and cut it away, that's what Gambhir does, rocks back and cuts it away past point, raced away
INDIA:3.4  Benn to Gambhir, no run, tapped to the short mid wicket fielder

INDIA:3.1  Benn to Kohli, no run, fraction short outside off, cut away straight to the fielder at backward point, good diving stopSachin walking: Sachin walked as soon as he nicked it and did not even bother looking at the umpire. If it had gone upstairs, he might have been ruled not-out as there was no evidence to prove that he had nicked it. Remember there is no hot-spot or snicko as well.
INDIA:2.6  Rampaul to Gambhir, no run, angled across Gambhir on a good length outside off, he shoulders arms
INDIA:2.5  Rampaul to Kohli, 1 run, and again, but this time he gets it wide of backward point and turns the strike over

INDIA:0.6  Rampaul to Tendulkar, out Caught by Thomas!! Ladies and gentlemen, Tendulkar has walked! The crowd's voices have been muted. What a ripper from Rampaul. Produces an absolute pearler to dismiss the great man. Landed on off and moved away ever so slightly, Tendulkar was already on the front-foot, it squared up him up and the thin edge was taken by Thomas. Rampaul and Co. went up, Steve Davis shaked his head and said no, Tendulkar walked after he saw the umpire saying no. Replays show that it may have grazed the elbow. But Tendulkar would've known whether he had nicked so it. So that ends all the fuss. Wonderful to see as well. Tendulkar c Thomas b Rampaul 2(4) Rampaul to Tendulkar, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:0.5  Rampaul to Tendulkar, no run, short of length delivery on off and middle stump, Tendulkar once again is in a nice position to defend and he does so, showing the full face of the bat
INDIA:0.4  Rampaul to Tendulkar, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, Tendulkar gets right behind the line to push it to the off side

INDIA:0.1  Rampaul to Gambhir, no run, short of length delivery on off stump, Gambhir goes on the backfoot and defends it to backward point
INDIA:0.1  Rampaul to Gambhir, 5 wides, that's a horrid delivery from Rampaul, wayward bouncer, Devon Thomas had no chance, he leapt high and could not even lay a mitt on it, 5 wides to startGambhir and Tendulkar are at the crease. Gambhir is on strike. Rampaul will open the attackWe are all set to go and it will be me, Srivathsa who will start off proceedings. One thing to look forward to today: I'm looking forward to many things today - Sachin's probable 100th international ton, and so on and so forth. But the most important thing I'm looking forward to hearing is Devon Thomas' constant chatter. That would be some thing.Mark Nicholas on air: Here comes the incomparable Sachin Tendulkar. Here we go ladies and gentlemen. You don't get the kind of ovation that Sachin gets from the crowd when he walks out to bat. Listen to the ovation from the crowd. Maybe only a Bradman or a Shane Warne in his pomp at the MCG would have got the same ovation.National Anthems: First up is the melodious 'Rally around the West Indies' and then the Indian one. A huge cheer as the anthem ends. The stadium is jampacked as was expected on a hot Sunday afternoon in Chennai. Lots of people in the crowd have the tri-color painted on their faces. A couple of Aussies will be umpiring the game. Gayle presents the Maroon cap to Kirk Edwards who is making his debut. The West Indians are out there.Kohli: In the last game, it was a collapse. These things happen in cricket. We can't win each and every game in a World Cup. We will take the negatives out of that game and try to work on it in this match. The change in batting order was fine, we were in great positions and we wanted some quick runs. No complaints against being pushed down the order, the team is really confident and we would like to win the game and take on Australia in the quarters. This is a completely different scenario, this is the senior World Cup and that was the junior one (when asked by Christy Simson whether he plans to give any advice to the senior men on how to win the World Cup, having led his side to the under-19 title in 2006).Sourav Ganguly has a point to make on air: Sehwag's absence won't make a big difference, if he's not fit, he can't play and that's fair enough. But, the absence of Gayle and Chanderpaul will hurt the West Indies.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Kirk Edwards, Devon Smith, Darren Bravo, R Sarwan, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Sulieman Benn, Devendra Bishoo, Ravi RampaulIndia (Playing XI): Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Yusuf Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf PatelIndia have won the toss and elected to batSammy: We have played well and we would like to win here and stay ahead in the points table. Gayle and Roach are not playing. Edwards and Ravi Rampaul will play.Dhoni: We are batting first, seems a bit harder than the usual Chennai track. Spinners may not get as much purchase. The wicket won't change during the course of the game. It is important to get off to a good start. I have played two and a half editions of the IPL, with the new construction it is very breezy today. We have a couple of changes. Nehra is out and Ashwin, the local hero is in. Raina is playing in place of Sehwag.The captains walk out for the toss, as usual, it is Ravi Shastri testing his voice box in front of a packed crowd in Chennai.Pitch report: The centre pitch is used today, it was the same game used for England South Africa game. The wicket has been nicely rolled in, it is a hard wicket, there will be some bounce for the bowlers. 260-270 is a par score feels Ravi Shastri.India will slip to 4th place in the ICC ODI rankings if they lose today, but if they win, they will retain the No. 2 spot. Dhoni and his men won't be reading too much into this.The Indian team is out there practicing, Sehwag is not seen anywhere. Dhoni had mentioned in the press conference that Sehwag may miss out of this game. Will Raina and Ashwin get a game in? Meanwhile, Kemar Roach is ill and he may sit out of the game too. In such hot conditions, they would not want to risk him for sure.The average first innings score in day night games: 260Stadium records for both teams: India and West Indies have played two games against each other at Chennai, both have won 1 game each. India have played 7 games here, won 3 and lost 3. West Indies have played four games here and they have ended up on the winning side only once.Sachin Tendulkar will be playing his 450th ODI today, he is 47 runs away from reaching 18,000 ODI runs. Will the master get his 100th International ton?This is the last game of the league stage and we still aren't sure who's facing whom in the quarter finals. That's the beauty of this World Cup 2011, it has given us some nail biting thrillers and hopefully, we are in for another one of such cliffhangers. A warm welcome to one and all, we are in Chennai for the all important game between India and West Indies. A win for India would mean that they would be facing Australia in the quarter finals, and if they lose they would be facing Sri Lanka. This is Ajith, I will take you through the day along with Pradeep, Ganesh and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be back with lots of updates.by Saurabh SomaniThe guessing is almost over, but still not quite. At the conclusion of the final match of the league phase, when India and West Indies shake hands, we'll know the exact quarter-final matches for the World Cup 2011. However, the uncertainty over which teams would make it to the knock-out stage has been eliminated. Fittingly enough, the top 8 teams are going through. The fact that India and West Indies have both qualified for the quarter-finals does not make their match any less important though. For a start, no team likes to lose, and more importantly no team would like to enter a knock-out stage of a World Cup on the back of a loss. Moreover, both sides do not have a win against any of the top nations, with only victories against minnows, and they need the feel-good factor that a top level win will bring.Quarter-final Scenarios: The scenarios now are fairly simple. If India beat West Indies, the order of the teams in Group B will be: South Africa, India, England, West Indies. Which would make for the following quarter-final matches: Pakistan vs West Indies, Sri Lanka vs England, Australia vs India and New Zealand vs South Africa.
If West Indies beat India, the Group B order will be: South Africa, West Indies, India, England. This would make for the following quarter-finals: Pakistan vs England, Sri Lanka vs India, Australia vs West Indies, New Zealand vs South Africa.
If the match ends in a tie/no result, the Group B standings will be: South Africa, India, West Indies, England. The quarter-finals would then look like this: Pakistan vs England, Sri Lanka vs West Indies, Australia vs India, New Zealand vs South Africa.India: The main talking point from the Indian camp is the likely unavailability of Virender Sehwag, who has picked up a knee injury. Even if Sehwag were to recover, it is very likely that the team management will rest him so that the injury does not aggravate and he is ready for the quarter-finals. In that case, Suresh Raina will come into the side while Gautam Gambhir will open with Sachin Tendulkar. Given that Sehwag will be an automatic entry if fit, if India lose 5 wickets or more, this match could well decide whether Raina can cement his place in the team for the next few matches ahead of Yusuf Pathan or even perhaps Virat Kohli. The bowling line-up is sure to see some changes too, with R Ashwin making his World Cup debut. The man most likely to miss out will be Ashish Nehra, who has been off the boil for a while now. England showed that a two off-spinner attack against the West Indies (who are packed with left-handers) worked superbly, and India will be hoping for the same with Harbhajan and Ashwin.West Indies: West Indies discovered a new hero in Andre Russel in their loss to England, and showed plenty of threatening signs without doing that little bit extra that was needed to seal the game. They haven't won an ODI against any of the other quarter-finalists since June 28, 2009 - which is a pretty large albatross to have around their necks. They beat India on that day, but have gone 20 matches against the 7 teams since then without a single win. For West Indies to pull off that elusive victory they need the men who can turn matches in their ranks - Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard, Kemar Roach and to an extent Ramnaresh Sarwan - to see the job through till the end. Until that happens, West Indies will not be able to break their win drought. They are likely to stick to the same eleven that played against England, and the successful debut of Devendra Bishoo means that in Roach, Benn, Russell and Bishoo the West Indies have a bowling attack that looks much better than the initial one-man-Roach-express that it was expected to be at the start of the World Cup.Trivia* Appropriately enough, the final match of the league phase is Match Number 42. As any person who has read Douglas Adams' delightful 'Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy' will tell you, that is the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything. India, though will be happy if Match No. 42 merely gives them the answer to 'Who should be part of our bowling attack and how can we make it more potent?'
* An India-West Indies clash in a World Cup will always evoke nostalgic memories in Indian fans who were fortunate enough to watch the 1983 Finals. Strangely enough, the last time the two sides met in a World Cup was also the last time the World Cup was played in the subcontinent - way back in 1996. India had ended up winning that match fairly comfortably. The World Cup 'head-to-head' for both teams now stands at 3 games each.
