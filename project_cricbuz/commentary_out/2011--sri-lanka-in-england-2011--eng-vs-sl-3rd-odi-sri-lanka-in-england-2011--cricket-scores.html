It is a gorgeous day and the pitch looks like a belter, according to Mike Atherton.Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Thilina Kandamby, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suraj Randiv, Lasith Malinga, Suranga LakmalEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Eoin Morgan, Ian Bell, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Jade DernbachEngland have won the toss and elected to batHello all, and welcome to the Third One Day International between England and Sri Lanka from the home of cricket, Lord's. The series is interestingly poised at 1-1 after SL fought back to vanquish the hosts at Headingly on Friday. Will SL continue with the winning momentum or will England fightback? I am Pradeep and I will be joined by Kiran as we bring you all the action. Krishna will be on the scoring duties for the day. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates.Preview by PradeepThe 69 run victory by Sri Lanka at Headingly has infused a fresh lease of life into the series which was threatening to be a rather dull, one sided affair after the first match at the Oval. The win could not have not come at a better time for the beleaguered visitors who have struggled to hold their own in the face of some stiff challenge laid out by the home side.England: Despite the loss yesterday, England continue to look impressive in all the departments of the game. Alastair Cook and Craig Kieswetter have formed an useful alliance at the top of the order while Jonathan Trott continues to be a run-machine. The outright positivity of Kevin Pietersen and the adventurous Eoin Morgan give the middle order not just stability but also the big hitting ability. For a batsman of his class, Ian Bell seems to a waste at 6 though . England might have to rethink about their batting order in the event of a massive chase like the one yesterday at Headingly. Cook and Trott are solid, but tend to take time to settle putting the lower middle order batsmen under pressure. A swap in the batting order between Pietersen and Trott will lend more balance and power to this unit.The fact that Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann are no mugs with the bat afford England to play the extra bowler. Both Bresnan and Broad were ordinary with the ball yesterday and would like to be back to their meanest ways. On a flat surface, the sameness of the 4 man pace bowling attack was exposed and they might well look to get the left-arm spinning all-rounder Samit Patel into the mix at the expense of either Bresnan or Jade Dernbach.Sri Lanka: The island nation seem to have stumbled upon their best batting line-up after the exit of Sanath Jayasuriya. Mahela Jayawardene had shown in the past that he enjoys batting at the top of the order. He vindicated the faith of his skipper with a dreamy knock full of quality, going past his previous best of 128. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Chandimal ran themselves out at Headingly and would look to do better this time around. The middle order looks solid with the ever dependable Kumar Sangakkara and the exciting Angelo Mathews. Jeevan Mendis has started promisingly which augurs well for his future.The bowling of Sri Lanka has been one of the biggest talking points this summer but the presence of Lasith Malinga has provided a new dimension to this attack. Suranga Lakmal impressed with his pace during the Test series and has continued to live up to the expectations. Spinners are the major weapon of Sri Lanka, Suraj Randiv and Jeevan Mendis bowled well as a pair at Headingly to grab 5 wickets between them. Angelo Mathews bowled without any sort of pain for the first time since his comeback. His bowling gives the team the depth and balance.Final Word: With the series deadlocked at 1-1, the winner of this match will be heavily favored to go on and win the series. Sri Lanka will have the added incentive of getting past India into the 2nd spot if they win the remaining 3 matches. Expect a no-holds barred contest in the offing.Teams:England (From): James Anderson, Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Jonathan Trott, Jade Dernbach, Chris Woakes, Samit Patel, Craig Kieswetter(w), Ravi Bopara, Tim BresnanSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene, Suraj Randiv, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Thissara Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Thilina Kandamby, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dhammika PrasadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
