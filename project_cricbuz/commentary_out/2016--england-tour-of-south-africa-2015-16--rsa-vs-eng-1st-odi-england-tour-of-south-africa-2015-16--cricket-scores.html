SOUTH AFRICA:25.6 Topley to Duminy, out Caught&Bowled!! This will go down as one of the tamest dismissals in Duminy's cricket career. I'm pretty sure he would never want to watch a replay of this. Slower short delivery speared in, Duminy was early into the stroke. Looks to drive but ends up chipping it straight to Topley who clasps it sans any discomfort. Easy as you like.

SOUTH AFRICA:24.5 Stokes to de Kock, FOUR, whew! de Kock and his baby-faced 100's. This man is in imperious form and as Shaun Pollock points out "This is his 3rd ton in his last 4 ODI innings." Full toss on the pads, de Kock says thank you as he whips it off his pads, beating Jordan's sprint and dive at deep square. Out comes the helmet and the crowd greet him with a thunderous applause.

SOUTH AFRICA:21.2 Moeen Ali to de Kock, no run, this didn't look close to the naked eye but on replays it did. Slider angled in and de Kock ends up playing all around it, missed and is slammed a tad high on the pads. Moeen forces Morgan to go up for a review but it proved to be in vain...England have gone up for a review, for lbw against de Kock. Front foot - fine, inside edge - no. Remember the umpire's call is not out. Inside edge - no. Pitching - in-line, impact - in-line, wickets - umpire's call. Just clipping the top of leg

SOUTH AFRICA:19.3 Moeen Ali to de Villiers, out Caught by Stokes!! Stokes should just give up cricket and start up a production line of stunners. This was thumped off de Villiers's bat, swiveled in his crease and tonked it across the line but Stokes ran across at long-on, sticks his right hand out, stretches it a bit more as he continued to sprint in front and somehow manages to hold onto it. And then runs in an arc along the fence, making faces and celebrating. The replays are being seen to confirm whether he touched the rope while celebrating...the winds had blown the advertising triangles back and his boots seemed to have flirted with the softer grass where the triangles should have been. All's fine and he has been given OUT. de Villiers looked stunned. Absolutely shocked. One could have taken his face off and used it as a prop to explain the word "startled" to kids. de Villiers c Stokes b Moeen Ali 8(10) [4s-1]Moeen Ali to de Villiers, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

SOUTH AFRICA:18.2 Adil Rashid to de Villiers, leg byes, FOUR, loud appeal but no bat on that. Turns around to greet this mediocre ball down leg with a tickle, misses and a Topley's dive at fine leg is not good enough

Willey will open the attackThe action has started...two slips in placeAfter the end of the 30th over, England were 227/4 and the only thing to look forward to was whether they will go past 400 or not, they could not but registered their second highest score in ODIs (408/9 against New Zealand at Birmingham is their highest total). No matter how much we sympathize with the bowlers, one cannot deny that they could have put more effort. There were not many slower deliveries and yorkers - a modern-day necessity. The ball is travelling and the pitch is an absolute belter. If you are a fan of boom-boom cricket, South Africans have ABD in their ranks. He will relish batting here and may avenge the beating his bowlers suffered at the hands of the visitors. Chase coming your way in a while...It is tough to be a bowler. You have to feel for them in the shorter formats of the game. It must take an effort to wake up every morning, knowing that for the entire day, they will be clobbered all around the park. It was one of those days for the bowlers. They came, bowled and England batsmen thrashed them. In between, there was a century from Buttler, half-centuries from the other three batsmen. Bowlers tried all they could, Morris and de Lange bowled a beamer each (unintentional though) but to be fair, these days even beamers do not look threatening.

ENGLAND:2.1 C Morris to Hales, no run, pitched a tad fuller around off, driven off the inside half towards mid-on
ENGLAND:1.6 de Lange to Jason Roy, FOUR, rank bad delivery to cap off the over, sliding down leg and all Roy needed to do was to get some bat on that, tickled away down to fine leg
ENGLAND:1.5 de Lange to Jason Roy, no run, a swing and a miss! de Lange keeps it short and wide, Roy flashes sans any feet movement, beaten!
ENGLAND:1.4 de Lange to Hales, 1 run, "yes, yes, yes" is the call from Hales as he punched this length delivery crisply past Faf at cover, thinks of a second but seeing Faf slid he yells out a loud "no"
ENGLAND:1.3 de Lange to Hales, 2 runs, curled back in from a good length, tucked away behind square leg for another double
ENGLAND:1.2 de Lange to Hales, 2 runs, short of length and extra bounce on offer, the line is outside off and Hales is off the mark with a punch square of the wicket
ENGLAND:1.1 de Lange to Jason Roy, 1 run, too straight and too full, Roy flicks to fine leg and squeezes an easy singleMarchant de Lange, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackTwo slips for de Lange...
ENGLAND:0.6 C Morris to Hales, no run, full and straight, flicked to mid-wicket
ENGLAND:0.5 C Morris to Hales, no run, plenty of oohs and aahs...why? Hales got an inside edge onto his pad. Had there been no inside edge Hales would have been plumb in front. Length delivery that nipped back in around off and that inside edge saved Hales there
ENGLAND:0.4 C Morris to Jason Roy, leg byes, 1 run, full and spearing in on middle, Roy fails to glance it fine and gets it off the boot, there was a stifled appeal but it could have gone down leg
ENGLAND:0.3 C Morris to Jason Roy, FOUR, well executed! Pitched and Roy's eyes lit up as he clobbered the forward drive past cover, no point chasing that lads
ENGLAND:0.2 C Morris to Jason Roy, no run, much better! Good length and swung in sharply outside off, Roy covers his off-stump and shoulders arms
ENGLAND:0.1 C Morris to Jason Roy, FOUR, follows up with an equally poor delivery, back of a length on the pads, Roy flicks and finds the gap through mid-wicket, raced away!
ENGLAND:0.1 C Morris to Jason Roy, wide, horrid first delivery from Morris, waist high full toss well wide of off, Roy cannot lay bat on itJason Roy and Hales are at the crease. Jason Roy is on strike. C Morris will open the attackIt's pretty sunny out there and Chris Morris is at the top of his bowling mark. Roy to take the first strike. "PLAY" says the umpire and off we go... 2 slips in place...Teams:England (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Reece TopleySouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Rilee Rossouw, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Morne Morkel, Marchant de Lange, Imran TahirABD: We have got confidence and some momentum behind us and hopefully we will take it forward to win this ODI series. Marchant de Lange comes and Chris Morris will get a chance. We have deicided to give rest to Rabada. JP comes back to number 5 in the batting department.Morgan: We will bat first. It's fantastic to watch the boys from outside. They have played some really good Test cricket and hopefully we will carry the same momentum. The more they (Willey and Topley) play the better they become and hopefully more success. South Africa are a very strong side and really looking forward to a great series.Well! the news from the centre is..... Morgan calls it right and England are batting first, Roy declared fit and will open. South Africa surprisingly rested Kagiso Rabada and de Lange will take his place. Not a bad move I reckon. de Lange can crank it up and Rabada deserves a rest badly. Very badly...England have won the toss and have opted to batFor England, Liam Plunkett's injury forced Broad to stay back and the latter will be playing his 1st ODI since the 2015 World Cup. Jason Roy suffered a back spasm on Monday (during the practice session) meaning Moeen Ali might open with Alex Hales should the former remain unfit. Rashid and David Willey return to the national duties after their successful stints in the BBL. Hang on for the toss and captain comments...Teams news: Steyn, Philander and Kyle Abbott are out with injury concerns. Marchant de Lange might get a game while responsibility (in the bowling department) relies heavily on the resurgent Rabada. Tahir is back after a nightmare of a series in India and so is David Miler. Behardien will claim the all-rounder spot.The Test series is done and dusted. England won it 2-1,so what lies ahead? When I went through the scorecards of South Africa and England's last ODI respectively, I was surprised to note that both teams won the toss and batted first. Not just that, No.1 and No.4 from either side notched up a ton, dismantled the opposition and sealed the series. If one was a run-fest in Mumbai, the other was a Buttler-blitzkrieg in Dubai. India and Pakistan, the most favourite opponents, were on the receiving end. Must say England are an entirely different outfit from where they were last year. Mind you! South Africa have always been a dominant ODI side, and beating them in their own backyard takes some doing.12:30 Local Time, 10:30 GMT, 16:00 IST: Good afternoon and welcome to our coverage of the 5-match ODI series between South Africa and England. The 50-over format is no longer slow, low, laid-back paced by any means. The recent ODI series between Australia and India is prime justification for my statement. Benign tracks, bigger and broader blades (bats I meant), the enormous improvement in fielding standards and et al - all have become a common feature in the shorter forms of the game. So, you better know what's coming your way. Ball one in one hour. Drum roll, please...Preview:The switch in formats is bound to be a little more comfortable for South Africa, who have had a tough few months in cricket. With back-to-back Test series losses against India and England, the cricketing stock of the Proteas is at an embarrassing low. The switch from dreary whites to coloured clothing will also remind them of greener pastures. They won their last ODI outing, an eventful runathon in Mumbai that helped them clinch a bilateral series in India for the first time.England enter the game on the back of a similar run-fest against Pakistan late last year. That series win was a new awakening for England's batting unit in particular. The Eoin Morgan-led side was feted of heralding a new era in England's limited overs cricket. A bigger test of their skills will be against South Africa on the latter's home turf.The Proteas' bowling will be under the scanner after the loss of a few first-choice seamers to injury namely Dale Steyn and Kyle Abbott in the first game on Wednesday (February 3). However, Kagiso Rabada has grown in stature, and with Morne Morkel for company does pose a strong threat. Imran Tahir's leg-spin adds variety and he will fancy his chances against England although it must come with the caveat that this English line-up did tackle the threat of Yasir Shah pretty well in the ODIs in the United Arab Emirates.South Africa possess a fairly settled batting order in the ODIs and will be backing themselves to come good against a relatively inexperienced England line-up. The return of Stuart Broad to the limited overs game will be watched with interest as well. Broad hasn't played an ODI since the World Cup last year but was added to the squad after an injury to Liam Plunkett.Just like South Africa, England too will be a trifle worried about an injury to opener Jason Roy.There isn't much at stake for either team in this bilateral series apart from pride. There isn't a chance of any drastic shift in the ICC rankings irrespective of how the series pans out. For both teams though, it offers a chance to get some consistency on board in the format. With a majority of the players from both squads likely to be around for a few years, it offers them a chance to take another step ahead.England will consider the tour a major success if they manage to upstage the Proteas in ODIs as well. AB de Villiers and Co will take comfort from the victory gained in the final Test and will hope to carry it forward.JP Duminy acknowledged that a good start will be crucial. "In any sort of series and in any format the start is always important," he said. "The lead-up to that is also very important in terms of your preparation. A lot of us played domestic cricket this last weekend and a few of us got some runs so we will take a lot of confidence going into the first game."The confidence from a one-day cricket point of view has been good. We want to try and be as consistent as we can in the one-day format, we have won our last two series so we will take a lot of confidence away from that. We know that its going to be a tough challenge ahead of us, England have also been playing well in the one-day format."Teams:England (From): Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), David Willey, Adil Rashid, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, Liam Plunkett, Jonny Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Reece Topley, Jason RoySouth Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Marchant de Lange, David Wiese, Morne Morkel, Kyle AbbottLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
