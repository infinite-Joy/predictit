Tim Southee will start for New Zealand. Two slips in place..The Pakistani bowlers looked very ordinary. Their problems with the fifth bowler continues. To add to their worries, Bhatti conceded 93 runs in his 10 overs. In fact, Sarfraz's poor work behind the stumps, didn't help Pakistan's cause either. Now, it is upto their batsmen to try and chase this mammoth total town. Can they do it? Or will the Black Caps bowlers run through the visitors batting line-up? Join us in a short while to find out.New Zealand started off brightly as Brendon McCullum came out all guns blazing. Even though he departed in the 8th over, Williamson and Guptill stitched a 128-run partnership to steady the innings. Guptill, who started off slowly, picked up pace and alongwith Williamson, took the attack to the opposition. Williamson was brilliant with the bat yet again, notching up his 6th ODI ton, also his 13th 50-plus score in 18 innings. After Guptill got out, Taylor joined him at the crease and he looked in ominous touch as he also went on to score his hundred. Elliott and McCullum also chipped in at the last and helped the team reach 369/5 in their 50 overs.Taylor and Nathan McCullum walk off the field and the Black Caps must be delighted with the score on the board. Taylor's century was also the 100th ODI ton by a New Zealand player. It was a special knock for Taylor as this is 150th ODI game.4

He has two slips in place... Here we go...New Zealand have made three changes - Williamson, Vettori and Southee come in place of Latham, Anderson and Mills. Pakistan are unchanged for this game.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Younis Khan, Haris Sohail, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi, Mohammad Irfan, Bilawal Bhatti, Ehsan AdilNew Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Adam Milne, Trent BoultNew Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batPakistan's problems are not limited to their batting. With Junaid Khan ruled out of the World Cup, their bowling just became weaker. For the Black Caps, Kane Williamson's participation in the game is still doubtful. The team management will take the decision on his inclusion before the start of play. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.This is the final international game before the World Cup warm-ups start. For Pakistan, it is important that they get back in some sort of form before their World Cup campaign kicks off against India on February 15. Shahid Afridi and Misbah-ul-Haq looked in good touch in the last game, while the rest of the batting line-up failed.In the last game, Pakistan were completely outplayed by an all-round show from the New Zealand team. Currently, New Zealand have a 1-0 advantage, but expect Pakistan to come hard at them. Hello and welcome to the final ODI between New Zealand and Pakistan. For New Zealand, a win here would mean another series win, their third consecutive ODI series triumph. Can Pakistan stop them? We will find out soon.PreviewThe second and final ODI between New Zealand and Pakistan in Napier is the last chance for both teams to settle into the groove before the 2015 ICC World Cup. For Pakistan, this match assumes greater importance after their loss in Wellington. They were rusty in all departments and with the World Cup just 12 days away, Pakistan will be desperate to shake of the rust and win the second ODI in order to build confidence.For New Zealand, everything is clicking into place. Skipper Brendon McCullum is happy with the way the team is shaping up before the World Cup. Both the batting and bowling is performing consistently and the bench strength is strong. A win in Napier will give them the ideal boost just before the tournament.Team newsNew ZealandNew Zealand coach Mike Hesson said the team will continue their rotation policy depending upon the opponents and the conditions. "We're fairly well advanced in terms of what we think we've got with the bowling. But until we see the conditions, we won't make that call," he said. Kane Williamson, who had missed the first ODI with a shoulder injury, is in doubt for this match and a call on his inclusion will be taken just before the start on Tuesday. Martin Guptill, after two golden ducks, showed glimpses of returning to good touch by scoring 39 in Wellington while Brendon McCullum will be hoping to sign off with a big score.Probable XI1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (c), 3 Tom Latham/Kane Williamson, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Grant Elliott, 6 Corey Anderson, 7 Luke Ronchi (wk), 8 Daniel Vettori/Nathan McCullum, 9 Tim Southee, 10 Kyle Mills, 11 Trent BoultPakistanWith Mohammad Hafeez failing with the bat, Pakistan's top order remains fragile. Misbah-ul-Haq and Shahid Afridi saved Pakistan the blushes but the rest of the batting failed as a unit. Younis Khan's poor ODI form continues to be a problem. The bowling is also handicapped by the absence of Junaid Khan. With the batting in poor form and the bowling thin on experience, it will take a monumental effort from Pakistan to win in Napier.Probable XI1 Mohammad Hafeez, 2 Ahmed Shehzad, 3 Younis Khan, 4 Misbah-ul-Haq (c), 5 Haris Sohail, 6 Umar Akmal, 7 Sarfraz Ahmed (wk), 8 Shahid Afridi, 9 Bilawal Bhatti, 10 Ehsan Adil, 11 Mohammad IrfanStatsShahid Afridi averages 37.25 in New Zealand, his best in ODIs overseas.Since his 117 against Sri Lanka in Hamilton, Brendon McCullum has managed only 81 runs in five games at an average of 16.2.Teams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Younis Khan, Haris Sohail, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Sohail Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Bilawal Bhatti, Ehsan Adil, Sohaib Maqsood, Yasir ShahNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Adam Milne, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, Tom Latham, Tim Southee, Daniel VettoriLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
