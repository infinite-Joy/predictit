The team winning the toss will want to bowl first.Welcome to the 1st ODI between New Zealand and Zimbabwe from University Oval, Dunedin. After a thumping win in the Test at Napier, New Zealand will be looking to continue their domination over Zimbabwe. In the previous series that took place in Zimbabwe, New Zealand won the first two ODIs comfortably before Zimbabwe chased down 328 to register a record breaking win. Zimbabwe will be looking to put up a better show after their disastrous showing in the Tests. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Siddharth PrabhakarThis is the second time Zimbabwe and New Zealand will face off against each other in ODIs in less than a year. About 4 months back in October, the Kiwis had toured the African nation and had beaten them 2-1 in a 3 match ODI series. The first two games were one sided encounters, but Zimbabwe came into their own in the third one. But those games were in home conditions which are totally different to those in the island nation that they are currently touring. They were given a taste of the Kiwi medicine in the lone Test as their entire line-up succumbed twice in the same day. Zimbabwe have historically been a better ODI side and they will look to seek some revenge for the humiliation meted out in the one-off Test.New Zealand:The only bad news from the home camp is the injury of their skipper Ross Taylor who will be out of action for three-four weeks. The good news however is that, rest of the other players are in form and raring to go. Since their opponents are anything but menacing, the Kiwis are planning to field a few youngsters and assess their performance. Amongst them, Tom Latham, son of former explosive batsman, Rod Latham, is most likely to make his debut. New Zealand coach John Wright is reportedly impressed with his showing in the domestic scene and counts him as a future star. The other player who might get a look-in is Andrew Ellis who is a hard-hitting all-rounder. Brendon McCullum, the stand-in skipper is upbeat about his sides fortunes and will look to whitewash the dazed visitors.Zimbabwe:Zimbabwe's return to Test cricket showed some encouraging signs when they played Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh at home. This has been their first away tour and the initial signs have not at all been encouraging for their fans. They were bowled out twice within a day handing the Kiwis a big win. However. the shorter format is the one they play better. Their skipper Brendan Taylor, is also the rock around which rest of the batsmen play. Vusi Sibanda, a capable opening batsman, is not a part of the squad and that means that Taylor might need to open the attack .Their bowling as such looks good and spinner Ray Price will be depended upon to keep the batsmen quiet. If Ray Price does play this match, it will be his 100th ODI since making his debut about 10 years back . Regis Chakabva, who scored a gritty fifty in the second innings of the Test match will be another batsman to look out for.
