Thisara Perera's remarkable hitting has helped Sri Lanka to a decent total. How will the Bangladesh batsmen cope up with this testing pitch, against a strong Sri Lankan attack? Its game on here at Mirpur.From 67/8, Thisara Perera has single-handedly given Sri Lanka something to fight for. Bangladesh bowled exceedingly well at the start and had the visitors in all sorts of trouble. The pacers got some movement off the deck while the moisture also helped the spinners grip the ball. The visitors recovered in the form of an 82-run stand between Perera and Senanayake and it is now up to the bowlers to take Sri Lanka home. But for those dropped catches, Bangladesh's target could have been at least 40 runs lesser. Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain and Shakib bagged two wickets each while debutant Al-Amin Hossain was also impressive. Don't go too far away, the Bangladesh reply will begin in a short while.3

A Sunny dishes out the arm-ball, in fact it comes in a bit, Mathews defends it in vain, the off-stump is disturbed. Mathews was perhaps expecting the ball to turn.
