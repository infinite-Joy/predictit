The middle overs, the perceived slow overs went barraged for runs as a mega partnership dominated. Late wickets, yes, but Maharoof and Mathews ensured that the end wasn't entirely anti-climactic. 377/8 is a huge score and Ireland have an uphill task. Join us back to see if the hosts have the mental bullets to have a go.4

SRI LANKA:33.6 Murtagh to S Prasanna, 1 run, Porterfield at extra cover collected this push and flayed the stumps at the bowler's end. Sent upstairs and Prasanna was found to be in.. Risky single but that's what Sri Lanka have done well all day
SRI LANKA:33.5 Murtagh to K Perera, 1 run, turned round the corner for an easy single. The good thing is that the singles accompany the on-and-off aggression from Sri Lanka
SRI LANKA:33.4 Murtagh to K Perera, FOUR, why are they bowling short, do Ireland? This isn't the pitch and they don't have pace, perhaps. Pulled between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:33.3 Murtagh to S Prasanna, 1 run, there's the fifty. Celebrates it after tapping a ball to cover and running.. rather haring a single

SRI LANKA:32.3 Kevin O'Brien to S Prasanna, FOUR, and this is the shot of the day. The length was fuller, understandably, and Prasanna shows the full face of the bat to drive it past O'Brien. Lovely strike that
SRI LANKA:32.2 Kevin O'Brien to S Prasanna, SIX, pulled sixes are in fashion. Another short ball and this pitch's a pace robber. The short ball sits up nicely for Prasanna to spank it away over deep square leg
SRI LANKA:32.1 Kevin O'Brien to S Prasanna, no run, sent upstairs for a stumping.. Prasanna had a wild swish at this delivery outside off, missed and Wilson took the bails off. Replays suggest that he made it back in just in time
SRI LANKA:31.6 Barry McCarthy to S Prasanna, 1 run, Perera responds well to this quick single as Prasanna clipped this straight delivery, and then collides with the keeper who was running in to the stumps. All is well

SRI LANKA:17.1 Andy McBrine to Gunathilaka, no run, loopy delivery, hit back to the bowlerTime for a drink and the Irish would really need a breather. The Lankans have dominated the entire session of play thus far and the bowlers would need to come up with something out of the box to keep the scoring down. 300 looks easy at this stage

SRI LANKA:14.1 Kevin O'Brien to K Perera, no run, huge appeal for an LBW! But the umpire isn't convinced. Angles it into Perera from round the wicket and pings him on the front pad as he looks to flick it to the on-side. Replays indicate that it is probably going down the leg side. Good call
SRI LANKA:13.6 Barry McCarthy to Gunathilaka, 2 runs, spare a thought for Barry McCarthy. Once again he manages to draw the inside-edge and once again it goes past the keeper for a brace
SRI LANKA:13.5 Barry McCarthy to K Perera, 1 run, Perera gets onto the front foot and drives it firmly to sweeper cover for an easy single

Sri Lanka have made two changes. Lakmal and Maharoof will replace Pradeep and de Silva for today's game.Ireland have won the toss and have opted to fieldHello and welcome to our coverage of the second One Day International between Sri Lanka and Ireland. After pushing the Lankans quite close in the previous match, the hosts would be looking to sneak past the finish line on this occasion. Let's hope that it's a closely contested game as the weather promises to stay dry. Shanaka had a dream ODI debut and will look forward to today's game more than perhaps anyone else. Do join us for the Toss shortly..Preview:Sri Lanka currently lead the two-match One Day International (ODI) series 1-0. They beat Ireland by a comfortable margin of 76 runs through the Duckworth-Lewis method in the first game and enter the second on Saturday (June 18) as firm favourites.The Asian side made quite a few changes to the side that played the final Test against England at Lord's. Kusal Perera returned at the top of the order and was accompanied by Danushka Gunathilika, while Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews and Upul Tharanga formed the middle-order.However, it was all-rounder, Dasun Shanaka, who made an impact on the game, smashing a 19-ball 42 and then picking a five-wicket haul. Dinesh Chandimal's unbeaten hundred held the innings together while Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews chipped in with useful knocks. Ahead of the second ODI, the form of the middle order augurs well for Sri Lanka.The same cannot be said about Ireland though. The inexperience of the Irish batsmen was on display during the chase. They had all the elements to chase down 304; a good start by William Porterfield, a middle-order partnership and yet they still messed it up. That they ran out of wickets despite putting up a decent fight is a tell-tale sign of running out of steam. The two ODIs against Sri Lanka is also the start of what is possibly Ireland's busiest calendar ever. They are set to host 12 more ODIs in the year and will desperately be seeking a confidence-booster against Sri Lanka. They cannot afford to lose momentum especially with these results having a direct effect on their qualification for the next World Cup. So there is context aplenty even if it is a low-key game. Sri Lanka will be hoping to rescue a sorry tour so far with an improved show in the limited-overs format. A convincing victory against Ireland will only hold them in good stead ahead of the ODIs against England.When: Saturday, June 16, 15:15 ISTWhere: Malahide, DublinWhat to expect: During the first game, the drizzle was on for almost the whole game. The game also started late because of the wet outfield and there was stoppage during Ireland's innings, which the saw match being reduced to 47 over. However, the weather is expected to be better for the second game with no chance of rain and the temperature hovering around 17 degrees.Team news:Sri Lanka: There were a few changes from the side that played the last Test against England, but after winning the first game by a comfortable margin, Sri Lanka are not likely to tinker with the line-up.Ireland: The middle overs was a major concern for the hosts in the previous game. Hence they might be tempted to bring in either George Dockrell or Andrew McBrine, an extra spinner might help William Porterfield to attack a bit more.Did you know?Gary Wilson needs three more dismissals to become the first Irish keeper to 50 dismissals in ODIs. Niall O'Brein is leading the list with 48.The second ODI will mark the first occasion of Ireland playing two ODIs in a calendar year against the top eight nations since May 2014, excluding the matches in World Cup.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Dasun Shanaka, Upul Tharanga, Seekkuge Prasanna, Dhananjaya de Silva, Shaminda Eranga, Nuwan Pradeep, Lahiru Thirimanne, Suranga Lakmal, Farveez Maharoof, Suraj RandivIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, John Anderson, Ed Joyce, Stuart Poynter, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, Barry McCarthy, Max Sorensen, Tim Murtagh, Boyd Rankin, George Dockrell, Andy McBrine, Niall O'Brien, Stuart ThompsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
