Virat Kohli is the man in question. This looks very close. Have the bails been dislodged before Kohli got in? Looks tantalizingly close. May be, the benefit of doubt will go to the batsman.

This was the slower short ball from Morkel, Dhoni wanted to ramp it over the man at short third man but was deceived by the lack of pace, he can't get it over the man there and the fielder takes the simplest of catches to send the Indian skipper on his way back. The pressure continues to build on India. Dhoni c Steyn b M Morkel 47(61) [4s-5]M Morkel to Dhoni, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

INDIA:39.4 Duminy to Dhoni, wide, darted outside off, Dhoni leaves it alone

INDIA:36.4 M Morkel to Kohli, 2 runs, off-cutter delivered on a good length and once again into those pads, was that a chance? Kohli didn't bother to keep his flick along the ground. Duminy, at backward square leg dives to his right but no it was too far away. Another couple

Duminy took a smart low catch diving to his right in his followthrough. An extremely delighted Duminy throws the ball onto the pitch before he was mobbed by his team-mates. Rohit c and b Duminy 65(74) [4s-7 6s-2]Duminy to Rohit, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Jean-Paul Duminy [5.0-0-28-0] is back into the attackVishaal informs that there was a war of words between Rabada and Kohli in the last over.

Rohit is on strike. Steyn will open the attackSouth Africa are huddled up on the outfield. AB de Villiers doing all the talkingFaf spoke about partnerships being the key on this surface. India would hope that the dew comes and makes batting slightly easy. The run chase is going to be very interesting. Take a break and join us back at 17:45 local time for India's reply...South Africa sent David Miller to open the innings with Quinton de Kock. When the duo shared a brisk fifty partnership, it appeared as if the Proteas would score at least 320, but the spinners came on and tightened the lid. Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra bowled well throughout and were rewarded with a wicket each. Quinton de Kock held the innings together, but ran out of gas as he approached his hundred. In fact, today he recorded his 4th hundred against India in 7 games. Faf du Plessis too scored a handy fifty, but the lower-order batsmen found the going very tough as the ball was not coming on nicely to the bat.Faf du Plessis: "It's a nice total on this wicket. It's important to get partnerships on this surface. Their spinners bowled well and they squeezed well. Today was the hottest day so far for me on the tour. There was no breeze. Our keeper (de Kock) needed a bit of assistance and I am sure he'll be fine. It's a tough wicket. Hopefully there will be no dew to make the surface skid on and hopefully our spinners can get wickets."Nowadays, how many times have we seen South Africa score just 60 runs in the last 10 overs? Dhoni was always worried about death bowling, but his bowlers have done well today. Having said that, 270 is not a bad total at all on this surface. You need to spend time on the wicket before you play the shots.Two venues (Indore and Rajkot) known for high-scoring contests and we've had two modest scores, at least by modern-day standards. Sunil Gavaskar and Graeme Smith said at the pitch report that it was a belter of a track. Even AB de Villiers at the toss mentioned that it was 99 out of 100 times a bat-first wicket, but everyone seems to have misread the pitch, barring MSD. He opted to play three spinners and the ploy worked out very well for India as the three frontline spinners went for just 130 runs in their 29 overs and picked up three wickets.4
SOUTH AFRICA:49.6 Bhuvneshwar to Behardien, SIX, full toss and it's muscled all the way. Behardien signs off in style and that will give a bit of momentum to South Africa. Bhuvneshwar went for the yorker, missed it by a long way and Behardien smashed it over deep mid-wicket. He does a fist pump after knowing that he timed that ball very wellKagiso Rabada, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:49.5 Bhuvneshwar to Behardien, out Steyn Run Out!! 1 run completed. Steyn tries to steal the second run and sacrifices his wicket. He doesn't even wait for the umpire's decision, just runs off to the dressing room. Length delivery from Bhuvneshwar, Behardien toe-ends the slog on the bounce to Raina and it was a good throw for the bowler to effect a run-out. Steyn run out (Raina/Bhuvneshwar) 12(9) [6s-1]Bhuvneshwar to Behardien, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!

SOUTH AFRICA:48.6 Mohit Sharma to Steyn, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, cut to backward point and they take a sharp run
SOUTH AFRICA:48.5 Mohit Sharma to Steyn, SIX, that was telegraphed. Steyn knew that Mohit Sharma would opt for the slower ball, he read this from the hands even though it was delivered from back of the hand, he waited for the ball to come and muscled it very hard back over the sightscreen
SOUTH AFRICA:48.4 Mohit Sharma to Steyn, no run, that is a terrific yorker, I am sure Steyn himself will acknowledge that. It swung back in late and followed Steyn's boots as he backed away, the batsman just about managed to dig it out in time

SOUTH AFRICA:46.4 Mohit Sharma to Duminy, out Caught by Raina!! Duminy had to play the big shots as Behardien was struggling to time the ball and Raina, who is a very good fielder, takes a good catch. He turns back and points to the crowd. This wicket could make a difference of 10-15 runs to the final total. Fullish and angling in from round the wicket, Duminy goes for the loft, but doesn't hit it well enough, long-on runs forward, dives and takes a good low catch. Duminy c Raina b Mohit Sharma 14(14) [4s-1]Mohit Sharma to Duminy, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

SOUTH AFRICA:45.5 Bhuvneshwar to Duminy, 1 run, that goes down as a dropped chance. Good length delivery down the leg-side, Duminy looks to tickle it, sends it very fine, Dhoni dives to his right and goes one-handed, but it pops out. That should have been taken as it went to his natural side
SOUTH AFRICA:45.4 Bhuvneshwar to Behardien, 1 run, finally a run, through a back foot punch to long-on

Looks like 275 could be a handy total on this surface. But a lot depends on the dew factor. If there is dew, then batting might be slightly easy in the second innings.

Fast and full outside off stump, Duminy gets down on one knee and reverse-paddles it very fine and third man was inside the ringI forgot to mention that Harbhajan Singh has finished his quota.

SOUTH AFRICA:40.4 A Patel to Behardien, 1 run, tossed up outside off stump, Behardien drives it to long-off

SOUTH AFRICA:40.1 A Patel to de Villiers, out Lbw!! Appeal for LBW and up goes the finger in a flash. South Africa have lost their last three wicket for just 5 runs. This is a tremendous comeback from India. As always, Axar darts one in from round the wicket, it was the slider as well, de Villiers makes room to slice it towards point, but the ball brushed the pad before hitting the bat and it was pretty straightforward. This is a massive blow for the visitors. The run rate has dropped and de Villiers was key here to post anything over 280. de Villiers lbw b A Patel 4(5) [4s-1]A Patel to de Villiers, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Axar Patel [6.0-0-35-0] is back into the attackJean-Paul Duminy, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:39.6 Harbhajan to de Villiers, out de Kock Run Out!! South Africa won't mind this wicket, QdK was really struggling out there. Anyway, he's played an excellent innings. Flighted delivery on the off stump, de Villiers works it to the left of mid-wicket, he takes off for a run, but de Kock was watching the fielder, who was diving to stop the ball, hence couldn't react immediately. AB though was always committed for the run and QdK didn't have enough power in his legs to reach the striker's end even as the throw was very poor to Dhoni. The ball came slowly to the keeper as Dhawan threw the ball when he was tumbling. de Kock run out (Dhawan/Dhoni) 103(118) [4s-11 6s-1]Harbhajan to de Villiers, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!QdK is run-out
SOUTH AFRICA:39.5 Harbhajan to de Villiers, FOUR, so easily done. Full and in the slot, de Villiers doesn't try to hit it too hard, waits for the ball to come and drives to the left of the extra-cover, there is no one in the outskirts to stop the ball

SOUTH AFRICA:38.5 Mohit Sharma to du Plessis, out Caught by Bhuvneshwar!! Faf tries to be cheeky once again, but it's not effective this time. On seeing Faf try a ramp again, Mohit bowled this slightly outside off and forced the batsman into a bit of a tangle, the ball takes the toe end of the bat and goes up in the air, short third man runs back and completes an easy catch. End of a fine knock and end of fine 118-run stand as well .du Plessis c Bhuvneshwar b Mohit Sharma 60(63) [4s-6]Mohit Sharma to du Plessis, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SOUTH AFRICA:38.4 Mohit Sharma to du Plessis, FOUR, cheeky and it's effective. Faf moves across the stumps and ramps the slower delivery past Dhoni, fine leg had no chance
SOUTH AFRICA:38.3 Mohit Sharma to de Kock, 1 run, good length delivery on the leg stump, de Kock swings hard and gets an inside edge to fine leg
SOUTH AFRICA:38.2 Mohit Sharma to de Kock, FOUR, down the track, slapped hard, beats the diving fielder at extra-cover and it's another hundred against India for de Kock in ODIs. No great celebrations from him. He's a really tired man. Mohit tried to drag the length back on seeing the batsman advance, but it wasn't short enough and the batsman was able to time it sweetly. Just a gentle punch in the air and then a customary raise of the bat to the dressing room. Dhoni claps from behind the stumps to acknowledge QdK's effort. In fact, I am told that this is his 4th hundred against India in 7 games
SOUTH AFRICA:38.1 Mohit Sharma to de Kock, no run, shape back into the left-hander and it's driven straight to mid-offMohit Sharma too bowls from round the wicket to de Kock

SOUTH AFRICA:37.3 Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, 1 run, uppish, but drops safely. Slower delivery outside off stump, du Plessis races down the track and looks to loft, the ball goes off the toe end of the bat and falls before the incoming long-off fielder. It was an easy single and Faf was surprised that QdK wasn't responding immediately. The youngster is very tired FafBack over the wicket to Faf
SOUTH AFRICA:37.2 Bhuvneshwar to de Kock, 1 run, too straight, easily worked away off the pads to deep mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:37.1 Bhuvneshwar to de Kock, no run, round the wicket, fullish and just a hint of reverse-swing back into the left-hander, driven to mid-offBhuvneshwar Kumar [6.0-1-41-0] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:36.6 A Patel to du Plessis, no run, oh the inside edge is found, but luckily for Faf, it rolls to short third man off the pad. He was down on one knee to slog-sweep and he got away with the edgeQuinton de Kock signals for the physio to tend to him.
SOUTH AFRICA:36.5 A Patel to du Plessis, no run, poor ball, shortish and down the leg-side, should have been put away, du Plessis gets inside the line and helps it straight to short fine leg, Dhoni collects the throw and flicks it back onto the stumps but Faf was well inside

SOUTH AFRICA:35.3 Harbhajan to de Kock, no run, slower through the air again from Harbhajan, de Kock defends off the front foot, as the ball rolls to the left of the bowler, Dhoni shouts "yours," Harbhajan dives to his left and gets a hand on it

SOUTH AFRICA:34.1 Mishra to de Kock, no run, the googly. de Kock is left flummoxed. He hangs his bat outside off but is convincingly beaten on the outside edge
SOUTH AFRICA:33.6 Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, FOUR, slower ball, du Plessis picks it. Comes down the track and lofts it imperiously over mid-off. That raises his 19th ODI fifty as well. In fact, it's a hat-trick of fifties for Faf in this series. He raises the bat to the dressing room to acknowledge the applause
SOUTH AFRICA:33.5 Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run, tries to dab it into the off-side but chops it back onto the pitch off a thick inside edge
SOUTH AFRICA:33.4 Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, FOUR, was that a chance? Maybe not. Just evades the fingertips of Dhawan as he was diving full stretch. Back of a length and angling in on off, du Plessis swats the pull away. Didn't get hold of it completely and was in the air but just wide of short mid-wicket, skims away to the fence
SOUTH AFRICA:33.3 Bhuvneshwar to du Plessis, no run, goes over to off-stump looking to lap this fine, the length was there as well to play the shot, just fails to lay any bat, the ball dribbles away off the thigh pad

Phew, plenty of action in the last half hour or so. du Plessis can thank his stars. A big reprieve for him as he was caught off a no-ball. This is just unprecedented. The amount of wickets that are being overturned these days due to bowlers overstepping. Get that foot behind the line. That seems to have settled him down though. Meanwhile, Dhoni is getting through the overs pretty quickly. Spin, spin and more spin..

SOUTH AFRICA:30.5 A Patel to du Plessis, no run, du Plessis is cramped for room in his back foot defence, was the arm ball and the batsman played back. Just about gets his bat down in time to keep it out
SOUTH AFRICA:30.4 A Patel to du Plessis, FOUR, might have premeditated the slog sweep with no protection in the deep. Gets it on a length and makes a good enough connection to lift it over mid-wicketThe heat is getting to de Kock. He is on his haunches and doing some stretching

Bhuvneshwar will start from round the wicketIt's excruciatingly hot in Rajkot as the players walk to the middle of the pitch. The two umpires are out, followed by the Indians - after completing their final team huddle. David Miller is opening then, that's two left-handers first up. First time in ODIs that MIller will be opening the innings.We are hearing that David Miller might be opening for South Africa with Hashim Amla pushed down to three. We are waiting for an official confirmation, we might get it only when the two South African openers prod out. Miller has struggled for runs so far, will opening against a new-ball release some pressure off him?Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni(w/c), Suresh Raina, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohit SharmaSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Morne MorkelMS Dhoni: "Looks like a good surface, we were looking to bat first as well. But not too disappointed as our spinners will come into play with the dew factor. Umesh Yadav makes way for Amit Mishra. The last game was good for us, getting a win is always good and you don't want to be 2-0 down very early."AB de Villiers: "We will bat first. It's a really good wicket, can't see much flaws in this wicket. We are playing the same team. We've got a lot to play for today, a big pressure game. We have to lay the foundation, do the basics really well. We know we are a really dangerous side with wickets in hand."South Africa have won the toss and have opted to batToss time folks!Pitch Report: "This is such a terrific pitch to bat on. The wicket looks beautiful, the outfield looks very good. You would want to win the toss and bat first. Batters have a wonderful opportunity today. Runs, runs, runs," reckon Sunil Gavaskar and Graeme Smith.12:55 Local Time, 07:25 GMT, 12:55 IST: Spin played a big role in India winning the second ODI. Will they be tempted to play Amit Mishra as well? Vishaal certainly thinks so, he says all the three spinners are working out extensively. Who will miss out in that case? Umesh Yadav? Vishaal has more, Umesh isn't warming up, Bhuvneshwar and Mohit are marking their run-ups, so, we might well have a spin fest from the hosts. Anway, the toss is just a few moments away..12:45 Local Time, 07:15 GMT, 12:45 IST: Our man, Vishaal Loganathan, has finally made it into the ground after extensive security drills by the police. He says that things look calm and peaceful, but there's a lot of checking and plenty of cops around. There are no hints of any protest or trouble at the moment.12:40 Local Time, 07:10 GMT, 12:40 IST: The agitators had threatened to block the roads leading towards the stadium. The security has been very tight and the two teams have safely reached the ground.Rajkot is hosting its 15th ODI, but this is just the second match on this ground. The hosts lost the first ever ODI here - by a small margin of 9 runs to England, in January, 2013. It was a match that saw both teams score over 300+ runs, meaning it should be a good batting wicket. Will it stay the same today? Will cricket take centrestage and unite this city as well as the country? We will get to know in a while..The bowlers held their own and were also helped along by some unnecessary aggression shown by the South African batsmen. Skipper AB de Villiers complemented MSD's batting, but also added that his team would continue with their aggressive approach going ahead. While controlled aggression is the way to go, the visitors batted with gay abandon - often throwing away their wickets and hurting their own prospects. The likes of Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock and David Miller haven't been amongst the runs - a fact that will not be lost on them.Back to the match, India came storming back into the series with a superbly executed 22-run win in the second ODI in Indore. It wasn't a flawless performance though, the batsmen struggled and if not for a battling unbeaten 92 by MS Dhoni - might have well got way less than the final score of 247. The skipper has been under severe pressure - not just about his captaincy but also with respect to his own batting. With the pressure off, will Dhoni resort to his natural style of batting? Barring Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane, the rest haven't fired either. India would love for more significant contributions from the likes of Dhawan, Kohli and Raina.12:10 Local Time, 06:40 GMT, 12:10 IST: The series is nicely poised at 1-1 and the carnival now moves across to the western Indian city of Rajkot. The third match of any 5-match series gains immense significance, the winner will put themselves in pole position - going into the final two matches, but it isn't just cricket that's making all the news on this Sunday afternoon. The Patidar agitation has threatened to cast a shadow on the actual match itself. While plenty of political motives are attached to this protest, one hopes that cricket will be the eventual winner - in what is turning out to be a keenly contested ODI series.Preview:With the series parity restored with a rare, old-fashioned low-scoring thriller in Indore, India and South Africa move to Rajkot in search of a decisive lead in the third One-Day International (ODI) of the five-match series, on Sunday (October 18). The possibility of a political disruption from Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) and a few poor umpiring calls thus far, have marred the lead-up to what should be a fascinating clash between two sides that look evenly-matched for the first time since the start of the tour on October 2nd, 2015.The track in Rajkot has often been dubbed as one that most batsmen would love to carry around with them, but left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja's recent heroics with the ball against Tripura (6-27 & 5-45) and Jharkhand (6-71 & 7-55) in the Ranji Trophy will give both camps a fair idea of what to expect on Sunday. Mahendra Singh Dhoni's punt of playing Axar Patel, the left-arm spinner and a number seven batsman expected to tonk a few, ahead of an effective leg-spinner in Amit Mishra paid off well. With Jadeja generating copious amounts of turn, Axar will be licking his fingers before Sunday's fixture. Even as Dhoni defended Shikhar Dhawan's recent slump in form, the concerns at the top of the order are evident. Rohit Sharma remains key to India's plans upfront while Ajinkya Rahane's performances in a new role - at number three - have also been part of the positives in the series so far. Virat Kohli has gone 12 innings without a fifty-plus score but Dhoni has put all his faith in his talent, to come good in a new batting role.Dhoni, whose typically-menacing willow wilted in the face of extra pace from a 20-year-old youngster Kagiso Rabada in Kanpur, was restored to a great extent in his innings-reviving 92-run knock in Indore, that went on to be pivotal for India's victory. The widely-talked about slump in form and reflexes were well and truly rubbished by the skipper in inimitable fashion. There are still issues, however, with the crucial batting roles of the number six and seven, with Suresh Raina failing on both occasions so far while Axar too has been merely a makeshift option. Among the bowlers, Bhuvneshwar Kumar retains his faith in his own ability to move the ball both ways but his opening spell has been worrying for India in the two games so far. The otherwise disciplined bowler in the outfit, has found it difficult to get the ball to swing early on and his gentle medium pace has often been dealt with rather consummate ease. Umesh Yadav has typically gone through periods of being erratic and brilliant in equal measure and his captain will hope for a much better start on Sunday. Harbhajan Singh put on a tidy performance under pressure in Indore and with the possibility of more turn in Rajkot, his impact could be much bigger.The visitors' camp, meanwhile, would have spent a bit of time trying to find a reason for a template collapse in the low chase in Indore. Just when they looked in complete command, a wicket, against the run of play, sent them down a downward spiral in the second One-dayer. AB de Villiers is in an incredible phase of his career where fans - irrespective of their loyalties - let his name resonate around the ground. The South African captain has expressed his delight at the amount of adulation he has received thus far, but can ill-afford to get carried away. He began the series with a devastating knock in Kanpur but the pressure got the better of him in Indore. When the teams square off in Rajkot, he will hope to tonk a handful and take the game away from the hosts as soon as possible.The real cause of concern for South Africa remains in the middle and lower-middle order, where David Miller has struggled to execute his duties of an able finisher. Miller, all of 26, has endured a slump in form, identical to Kohli, but the South African camp is expected to stick by the youngster they have invested heavily in. Dale Steyn was at his best in the second ODI, showing no signs of his recent slump in form and effectiveness in limited-overs cricket. Morne Morkel's return to the side too has bolstered them to a great extent. The most eye-catching performer, however, has been the feisty, young Rabada. His ability to keep his nerve against a finisher like Dhoni in the final over of the game speaks volumes of his temperament. The right-arm pacer has packed in smart variations along with brute pace and would've have been part of India's lengthy discussions in the last couple of days.After rather one-sided Twenty20 Internationals, the series has sprung to life in the ODIs. If external factors - like protests and poor officiating - stays away, the crowd is in for a riveting contest.Probable XI:South Africa: Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Morne MorkelIndia : Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni(c & wk), Suresh Raina, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Umesh YadavTeams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Aaron Phangiso, Khaya Zondo, Chris Morris, Kyle AbbottIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni(w/c), Suresh Raina, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Stuart Binny, Ambati Rayudu, Amit MishraLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
