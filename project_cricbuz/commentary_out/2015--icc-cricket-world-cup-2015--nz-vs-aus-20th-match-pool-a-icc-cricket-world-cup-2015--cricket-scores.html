He didn't get the timing right nor the elevation, picks out Cummins at mid-off, who takes a good low catch. The umpire check for the no-ball. Wait a minute, did Cummins catch that cleanly? Or did he touch the turf. Anderson is still waiting as the TV umpire looks at the replay. In fact, Ronchi is also out and the umpire needs to get this right first. This is a doubtful decision, but Anderson has finally been given his marching orders now. Anderson was not happy there, he threw his gloves after reaching the dug-out.

What I have seen in the last 3 hours here in Eden Park has been the most astonishing atmosphere, these are the most astonishing scenes I have ever seen in New Zealand.'That will be the supper break! Those couple of wickets just before the break, brings the match back in balance. New Zealand still need 73 runs and Australia require 7 wickets.

AUSTRALIA:0.1 Johnson to Guptill, no ball, FOUR, poor start from Johnson, strays it onto the pads, Guptill stays back and tickles it to the fine leg fence. To make matters worse, Johnson has overstepped. The fielder at fine leg had no chance of stopping thatGuptill and Brendon McCullum are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Johnson will open the attackWelcome back... Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill are out in the middle. Johnson has the new cherry in his hands. He has two slips to assist him..Vettori: "You come to this ground and it's quite difficult to bowl with this small boundaries. Particularly the start Australia got, to fightback like that behind Trent's (Boult) bowling, was amazing. Once again the noise was fascinating. To hear the crowd get so excited. That one over from Trent where we got a couple of wickets, they got right involved in it. I think I haven't heard something so loud, since playing in New Zealand. It's going to be a tricky score and the wicket has just enough in it and we know the quality of the Australian attack. So, it's going to be a good run-chase and lot of fun for the crowd. I think if you hit a length, then it would hold a little for the seamers and also for myself. I think it's not a typical run-scoring wicket here, but hopefully we will get through."Brendon McCullum was aggressive in his field placements and his bowlers responded beautifully. From 80/1 to 106/9, the Kiwi bowlers pulled the curtains down on Australia. Eventually, after a 45-run partnership between Haddin and Cummins, Australia folded for 151. McCullum will surely come out attacking. But, what will be Australia's approach? The run-chase will being very shortly. Do stay tuned!After that the floodgates were opened. Warner was trapped LBW, he reviewed and Hawk-Eye showed that it was kissing the bails. Boult returned for his second burst and just ran through the famed Australian batting line-up. The left-arm pacer send back Maxwell and Marsh in one over. Clarke was battling it out, but he too succumbed to the attacking fields set by B-Mac. Boult, then registered his maiden ODI 5-wicket haul by ripping through Johnson and Starc. Haddin then hit a few meaty blows to give some respectability to the score. Nonetheless, it is still Australia's lowest score in World Cups batting first.What an anti-climax at Eden Park! Billed to be the biggest game of the 2015 World Cup, it has been a one-sided affair so far. Warner and Finch came out all guns blazing. They took the score 30/0 in 2.1 overs, but Southee struck and sent back Finch. Watson and Warner kept attacking and added 50 runs for the second wicket. However, the introduction of Vettori stemed the run flow. The veteran also provided the crucial wicket of Warner. 3

There is not going to be much pace, but the new ball will swing a bit. It is a short boundary and it is all about how many runs you can get," reckons Shane WarneTeams:Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke(c), Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Pat CumminsNew Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Trent BoultAustralia have won the toss and have opted to batMcCullum: "Obviously, two well respected families and the trophy means a lot to us. We haven't played it for a long time. So, it's nice for us to go on the line today. We would have bowled first as well. The stats here are pretty favorable to the team bowling first. The wicket looks great and the outfield looks amazing, I am sure we are going to get a fantastic crowd. We have two good teams going at it and obviously a big scalp on the line with the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy as well. The guys had left for a couple of days, reconnecting with their families, then we came back together as a group and we trained pretty hard over the last couple of days. It's great to be able to have that luxury of allowing guys to go home for a couple of days. But, our focus is pretty much now on this game. We have got some big games coming up in this tournament and this is certainly one of them. So, it's an exciting day. No, we have got the same team. That's the beauty of us playing some good cricket. We get to give the same guys the opportunity again against a very good Australian team. So, we will go well. If we bowl well first up and then we can go about chasing whatever total they set us."Clarke: "Not a bad place to play here at the Eden Park. It's going to be a fantastic crowd, they will certainly turn the weather on, so hopefully, we can put on a good show. We are going to have a bat first. The wicket looks fantastic, I think it's going to be pretty even for both teams. Batting first or bowling first is irrelevant. I think it would be nice to put some runs on the board. We are sick of training. We obviously got here early, got here last Sunday in preparation to prepare in different conditions from what we get back home in Australia. So, everybody is really excited. A good crowd coming, so lets hope we can entertain and put on a really good game. Pat Cummins comes in and gets an opportunity for Josh Hazlewood. The boys are really excited and we have spoken a lot about the squad playing a big role in us having success throughout this tournament and this game will be no different."That concludes our pre-match build-up. We are not too far away from the toss as well. Stay tuned.FORM GUIDEBased on current form, Australia and New Zealand are the two best teams in the World Cup. So, let us have a look as to why these two are favorites to win the competition.New ZealandBrendon McCullum's captaincy has been talked about much in the last couple of months. He leads the team in the same way he approaches his batting, that is, with an attacking, aggressive mindset. So far in the tournament, the Black Caps have thrashed Sri Lanka, beaten Scotland and annihilated England. Out of these three games, only in the game against Scotland they had a slight stutter and that was because they wanted to finish the game off in a hurry, sending out a message of intent to other teams. Apart from that, the encounters against Sri Lanka and England have been fairly one-sided to say the least.McCullum and Kane Williamson have been in the form of their lives. These two Kiwi batsmen have been consistent over the past 12 months. Martin Guptill and Ross Taylor form the rest of the top-order. Though they have not been as consistent, the two have had their moments. Luke Ronchi and Corey Anderson have stood up whenever the team has needed them. Grant Elliot's role as an all-rounder can't be discarded either. Coming to the bowling, Tim Southee and Trent Boult are arguably the best new ball pair at the moment. Add to that the pace of Adam Milne and experience of Daniel Vettori. It sure makes for a formidable bowling line-up.AustraliaAustralia have had a switch in captaincy in the 50-over format on a regular basis. However, one thing that remains constant whether they are playing under George Bailey or Michael Clarke or Steven Smith, is the killer instinct. They started their World Cup campaign against familiar foes, England. Aaron Finch scored a majestic hundred with George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell scoring fifties. Then, an unlikely hero with the ball rose to the occasion, Mitchell Marsh claimed his career best figures and the Aussies won by 111 runs. However, their second game versus Bangladesh was washed out due to Cyclone Marcia.Michael Clarke, who was given a deadline to be fit for the Bangladesh game, got himself another week's time. And now he is back and will lead Australia in this crucial encounter. It will be a direct swap with George Bailey. The only concern for the Aussies is the form of Shane Watson coming into this game. Other than that, the side looks settled with the two Mitchells - Johnson and Starc - shouldering the responsibilities of the bowling attack. Josh Hazlewood might miss out and Pat Cummins is his likely replacement.The 2015 World Cup is almost two weeks old and has seen plenty of action already. Let us see what are the few things that we have witnessed so far. Centuries - check, Double century - check, 5-wicket hauls - check, Hat-trick - check. India-Pakistan - check, Australia-England - check. And that now brings us to one of the biggest games of the tournament, New Zealand versus Australia. The Trans-Tasman rivalry is not just the only thing riding on this encounter.First of all, the winner of this game will claim the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Second, since these two teams are the co-hosts, whichever team finishes higher in the Pool will get to host the semi-final, should they come up against each other during that stage in the tournament. The winner of this game could well turn out to be Pool toppers and will definitely hold that advantage. Then, there is the momentum that these two teams are carrying forward, which neither would want to give up.BLAST FROM THE PASTIn World Cups, both teams have played each other on 8 occasions, with Australia leading 6-2 before today's game. Australia won twice in 1987 and once in 1996, 2003, 2007 and 2011 editions. New Zealand won in 1992 and 1999.Indore, 1987After the game got postponed by a day due to rain, it was reduced to a 30-over game on the next day. Australia batted first and put on 199, led by a 117-run partnership between David Boon and Dean Jones. In reply, John Wright and Ken Rutherford started off brilliantly, putting on 83 in just 12 overs. Martin Crowe then scored a 46-ball 58 to take his team within touching distance of the total. With 7 needed off the over, Steve Waugh first took the wicket of Crowe off the very first ball and then he bowled Ian Smith with a yorker on the very next delivery. Eventually, Martin Snedden was run-out and Australia managed to win the thrilling contest by 3 runs.Chandigarh, 1987Riding on a century from Geoff Marsh, who became the third player after Sunil Gavaskar and Glenn Turner, to bat throughout a World Cup innings, Australia posted 251 on the board. The Kiwis started off well with John Wright and Martin Snedden putting on a 72-run stand for the opening wicket. After that New Zealand kept losing wickets at regular intervals and eventually folded 17 runs short of the Australian total.Auckland, 1992Eden Park, the venue today, also hosted the World Cup opener between these two co-hosts in 1992. In the game, New Zealand got off to a really poor start, losing 2 wickets for just 13 runs on the board. Their captain Martin Crowe then took on the onus upon himself and notched up an unbeaten century to lift his team to 248/6. Crowe then opened the bowling with Dipak Patel, who kept a tight lid on the openers. Even though David Boon hit a century and Steve Waugh made a 34-ball 38 lower down the order, the defending champions lost their last 5 wickets for just 12 runs and were bowled out for 211.Chennai, 1996In the 4th quarter-final, Chris Harris scored his maiden ODI century and guided his team to an imposing total of 286, then their highest total against Australia in ODIs. For Australia, Mark Waugh starred with the bat, scoring his third century of the tournament. Steve Waugh, Marks twin brother, then finished with 59 not out and took his team through to the semis, with 13 balls to spare.Cardiff, 1999After losing Mark Waugh and Adam Gilchrist, Ricky Ponting and Darren Lehmann then put on a 94-run stand to lift Australia to 126 after they were 32/2 at one stage. However, the Australian innings could never take off as Geoff Allott picked up 4/37 to restrict Australia to 213/8. New Zealand were in deep trouble when they were 49/4, before a 148-run stand between Roger Twose and Chris Cairns steadied their ship. In the end, New Zealand cruised to a 5-wicket victory in 45.2 overs.Port Elizabeth, 2003In their Super Six game, Shane Bond took his career-best figures of 6/23 to leave Australia struggling at 84/7 at one stage. However, a 97-run partnership between Michael Bevan and Andy Bichel gave them some respectability as they finished with 208 for 9. With a semi-final spot up for grabs, New Zealand failed to make the most of the opportunity and crumbled in front of some great bowling from Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath. While Lee picked a 5-wicket haul, McGrath took 3 wickets, to bowl out New Zealand for a paltry 112.Grenada, 2007Before this Super 8 game even started, the last four spots had already been decided and hence, it was inconsequential. Mathew Hayden scored a century and with Shane Watson going berserk at the end, Australia posted a mammoth 348/6 in their 50 overs. For New Zealand, apart from Peter Fulton, none of the Kiwi batsmen got going and they were bowled out for a meagre 133 in just the 26th over.Nagpur, 2011Superb exhibition of fast bowling from Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson left New Zealand reeling at 73/6 in 17 overs. However, Daniel Vettori (44) and Nathan McCullum (52) then helped New Zealand recover as they managed to cross the 200-run mark. A 133-run opening partnership between Watson and Haddin set-up the run-chase. In the end, Australia romped home with 7 wickets and 16 overs to go.Hello folks! Today, Akshay Maanay and I (Sidhant Maheshwari), will try and bring you the most comprehensive coverage of the match that is being termed as 'The Clash of the Titans'Feb 1, 1981: Benson & Hedges World Series Cup, 3rd Final, MCGWith the best-of-five final tied at 1-1, New Zealand needs 6 runs off the last ball to tie the third game. Brian McKechnie is on strike and Trevor Chappell is the bowler. What happened next became one of the biggest controversies in cricket's history. Greg Chappell, the Australian captain and Trevor's older brother, instructs his bowler/brother, to roll the final delivery. Trevor obliges and under-arms the ball, McKechnie defends and throws the bat away in sheer anger.Greg Chappell's step created a lot of furore and was condemned all over. Bowling underarm was legal at that point of time, but was considered against the spirit of the game. The incident drew widespread criticism from all quarters, including the then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and New Zealand's Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, who described the incident as "the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket".Doing commentary for Channel 9 at that time, Richie Benaud, the legendary Australian captain, described it as disgraceful and one of the worst things that he has seen on the cricket field. To add to that, Ian Chappell, former Australian captain himself and the older brother of Greg and Trevor, was not too pleased with his brothers action either. He was heard saying, "No, Greg, no, you can't do that" in the commentary box.As a result of this incident, the International Cricket Council (then International Cricket Conference), amended the Laws of Cricket and deemed underarm deliveries illegal. Even though this entire fiasco took place 34 years back, it galvanised a Trans-Tasman cricket rivalry, which will be at its apex today.Do you know why the rivalry between Australia and New Zealand has gained so much prominence over the years? It happened because of a particular incident that took place in 1981.So, why it is known as the Trans-Tasman rivalry?The term Trans-Tasman is used for the inter-relations between both Australia and New Zealand, since the two countries are geographically separated by the Tasman Sea.11:30 Local Time, 23:30 GMT, 05:00 IST: Sometimes your neighbours are your fiercest rivals. The India-Pakistan rivalry is probably the biggest when you talk about neighbouring countries. Isn't it? But, today we are going to witness another huge rivalry, the Trans-Tasman rivalry between the two host nations of the 2015 World Cup, New Zealand and Australia. Preview World Cup co-hosts and pre-tournament favourites, Australia and New Zealand will square off in the all important Pool A encounter at the scenic Eden Park in Auckland on Saturday. A lot rides on the outcome of the Trans-Tasman clash besides bragging rights. For starters, the winner of the game will take home the coveted Chappell-Hadlee trophy.With both Australia and New Zealand enjoying a fine run of form, there is an added incentive of a potential top of the table finish for the game's winner. This would enable the winner to play a significantly weaker opponent in the quarter-finals. More importantly, neither team would want to concede any ground or momentum to the other considering the high probability of the two meeting again at the business end of the tournament. Should the teams meet in the semi-finals, their relative positions in the table become significant in determining whether the game gets played in Australia or New Zealand.Australia last played a game on the opening day of the World Cup when they routed England at the MCG. Cyclone Marcia interfered to give them an extended break after their game against Bangladesh was washed out. New Zealand, on the other hand, demolished Sri Lanka, Scotland and England in a three-game first week. All that will count for little when the teams step out tomorrow.Australia:Australia will cross the Tasman Sea knowing fully well that they will be up against a much different New Zealand side than the one they've been accustomed to in the 2000s. With the washout in Brisbane, Michael Clarke got himself another week of recovery activity. He will lead the side out for the first time this World Cup. Stand-in skipper George Bailey will make way for Clarke's return. James Faulkner is not fully fit and will not feature. Australia will be hopeful of another explosive start from David Warner and Aaron Finch. The talk from the team management is that Josh Hazlewood, who conceded 45 from his six overs against England, will make way for Pat Cummins.Player to watch out for: Shane Watson. The burly all-rounder got a first-baller from Stuart Broad in Melbourne. He could do with putting some runs on the board or run the risk of losing his place in the side to either James Faulkner or George Bailey.Playing XI:David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke(c), Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin(wk), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins.New Zealand:The Brendon McCullum-led side have run through sides with their three-prong pace attack and explosive top-order batting. In Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson, they have the two most consistent batsmen in ODI cricket. Martin Guptill and Ross Taylor however have yet to play an innings of substance and that remains their only weakness needing ironing out. Daniel Vettori's comeback to international cricket has been a revelation thus far. His ability to control the middle part of the innings with his left-armers holds the Kiwis in good stead going into their crucial clash. New Zealand are expected to name an unchanged eleven.Player to watch out for: Tim Southee, since destroying England with his seven-fer, suffered a shoulder niggle but is said to have recovered sufficiently for the clash. His battle with the Australian openers could shape the match.Playing XI (Probable):Brendon McCullum (c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott , Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(wk), Daniel Vettori, Trent Boult, Tim Southee, AdamMilne.Pitch and Conditions:The pitch, along with Eden Park's short boundaries, is expected to serve-up another 300+ score but with the quality of bowlers in either ranks, 270-280 could prove to be par. The weather is expected to remain pleasantly sunny despite showers disrupting Australia's practice session early on Friday.Stats and Trivia:WWWWW vs WWWWW: Both teams enter the game having won each of their last five ODIs. Australia went through the CB series undefeated while New Zealand won ODI series against Pakistan at home before winning their three opening encounters in the World Cup.The two teams met in the 2011 World Cup at Nagpur where Australia ran away with a comfortable seven-wicket win. Shane Watson top scored then with 62.Quotes:"You always want to beat Australia.
