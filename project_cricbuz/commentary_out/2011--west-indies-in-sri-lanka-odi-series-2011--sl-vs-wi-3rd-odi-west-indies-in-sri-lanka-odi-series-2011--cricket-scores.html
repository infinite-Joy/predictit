Sri Lanka lead the series 1-0 after the first match was abandoned due to rain. West Indies will be looking for a morale boosting win before the World cup, which will starting in 2 weeks time. As expected it's very gloomy out there in Colombo. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info.....Preview by Karthik LakshmananThere is less than two weeks to go for the mega event to start and the pre World Cup cricket season finally comes to an end tomorrow. Sri Lanka and West Indies have a last chance to test their World Cup preparations as they face off for the final match of the 3 match ODI series. The first thing that comes to mind when you think about the West Indies tour of Sri Lanka is rain. The heavy downpour, which washed out all the 3 Tests and forced postponement of the ODI series, has continued to be a constant feature throughout the ODI series as well.
Despite trailing the series 0-1 (the 1st game was washed out), West Indies will be a fairly happy side. The batsmen, known for their unpredictability, have acclimatised to the sub continental conditions rather quickly. In the first game, Adrian Barath's maiden ton and Ramnaresh Sarwan's solid 75 took them to a competitive 245. In the next, most of the batsmen did the tough part to get starts but failed to convert them into a match winning score. The bowlers haven't got much of an exposure in this series and in the one chance they got, they ran into a sturdy Upul Tharanga. With most of their batsmen showing good application, the Carribean team would be looking to test their bowling strength in the slow and low wickets of Sri Lanka.
For the Lankans, Upul Tharanga's match winning century in the 2nd game was an encouraging sign. Chasing a modest total, the home team managed to cross the line comfortably thanks to a solid ton by the southpaw in good company of former skipper Mahela Jayawardene. The Lankans will also be happy with the form of their opening bowlers Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara. The death overs specialist bowled a terrific spell in the first game to restrict the rampaging West Indies from 206 in 43 overs to 245 in their 50 overs. Kulasekara and Muralitharan bowled miserly spells in both the games and also managed to give vital breakthroughs. With an in form top order and a balanced bowling line up, the home team would be looking to test their middle order in the third game. It won't be a surprise if either Sangakkara or Jayawardene drop down the order to give the middle order more overs to bat.Weather:The third ODI is also shrouded under a rain threat and the conditions at Colombo do not look too encouraging. While both Sri Lanka and West Indies would be desperately hoping to get a game, the forecast does not look positive as scattered thunderstorms are predicted throughout the day.What they say.."Kumar (Sangakkara) and Mahela (Jayawardene) should not be batting at No. 3 and 4. One of them has to come down to No. 5 to bolster the middle order. Maybe they should send (Chamara) Kapugedera up the order to No. 4.": Arjuna RanatungaTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Dilhara Fernando, Rangana Herath, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Ajantha Mendis, Muttiah Muralitharan, Thissara Perera, Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Silva, Upul TharangaWest Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Adrian Barath, Carlton Baugh(w), Sulieman Benn, Dwayne Bravo, Darren Bravo, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Chris Gayle, Nikita Miller, Kieron Pollard, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Andre Russell, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Devon SmithLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
