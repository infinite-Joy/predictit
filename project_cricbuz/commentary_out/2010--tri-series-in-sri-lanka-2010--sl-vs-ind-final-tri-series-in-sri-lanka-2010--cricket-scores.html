INDIA:5.6 Kulasekara to Sehwag, out Sehwag Run Out!! What drama here! First there was a big appeal for LBW, it looked very close, the ball struck him plumb in front of middle but the umpire thought that he had got a slight inside edge on it, the ball struck him on the pad and deflected to Kapu at point, the appeal distracted Sehwag perhaps, he casually looks to stroll for a single once the LBW was rejected but little did he realise that Kapu had swooned in like a hawk from point to hit the stumps direct at the striker's end and Viru was out of the crease comfortably! India are in deep trouble now! Sehwag run out (Kapugedera) 28(22) [4s-6] Kulasekara to Sehwag, THATS OUT!!

It was a length delivery angling into middle and leg, it looked like the ball flicked Karthik's thigh pad on the way to Sanga who did wonderfully well to move to his left and take a good diving catch. Perhaps he has been done in by a poor umpiring decision from Asad Rauf, Karthik can't believe his luck but the Lankans in the stands are delighted with that! Malinga draws first blood for SL!

SRI LANKA:49.6  Patel to Silva, 1 run, superb last over from Patel, he prevents SL from getting to 300 with a sensible act of not going for the run-out as Silva swung and got an inside edge onto the pads, the ball rolled back to Patel who aborted his throw, SL end up on 299 and India need 300 to win.Nuwan Kulasekara, right handed bat, comes to the crease

Mahela Jayawardene is on strike. Praveen Kumar will open the attackNehra: I'm feeling quite good, bowling well from the last 18 months. The body feels good. On this wicket if you hit the right line and length, then we can pick up wickets upfront. With the white ball it is very difficult to get reverse swing. With the ball change coming in after 34 overs, it makes it all the more difficult to get the ball to reverse. We played the Asia Cup final here a couple of months back where in we scored 260, and they were bowled out cheaply. Under lights the wicket does a lot more. PK has a big fan club as I see, but I'm not too sure if I have one, but as long as the team does well I'm happy.Mahela: It's been a challenging wicket for all the batsmen. You have to have these challenges. It's not fun batting on placid wickets and posting 300 every time. We have to work hard for our runs and it has been a great contest. We have been up against 2 quality teams. We play the game only for moments like this, where in we play against the best. We've been consistent, this is our 4th final this year alone. We have won 2 of those finals and lost 1 to India, so as long as we are playing with consistency and getting the small things right, we are moving in the right direction. The mantra is simple - Just go out there and perform. It's about soaking the pressure and try to control the game upfront. The first 10-15 overs are the most crucial in a final, whether we bat or bowl first. Runs on the board in a big final is a big advantage, but that doesn't mean the side chasing can't win. As long we keep doing the right things, it doesn't matter.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Chamara Silva, Angelo Mathews, Thissara Perera, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suraj Randiv, Lasith MalingaIndia (Playing XI): Virender Sehwag, Dinesh Karthik, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Rohit Sharma, Praveen Kumar, Ashish Nehra, Ishant Sharma, Munaf PatelDhoni: It's a good sign that we've won the last game to reach the final, which means we have the momentum. Nobody can question our talent, it's all about the mindset rather than the technique, and hoping that the guys do the right things over here. It's important to build the pressure on the batsmen, and our bowlers are doing that well. We've got Rohit Sharma coming in place of Ravindra Jadeja.Sangakkara: We've got the same side that played India in the last game. This is probably the best pitches that we've played on. There shouldn't be much of a difference under lights. We want to graft and get anything over 200.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: Looks a beauty says Russel Arnold. SL scored 312 on this track in the Asia Cup. The wicket is a dry and hasn't been watered for 5 days. This a 'win the toss bat first' kind of wicket.It's crunch time folks! The big final of the tri-series between Sri Lanka and India. It promises to be a mouth watering contest and the Lankans would be hungry for revenge. Remember, it wasn't too long ago that these 2 sides played the final of the Asia Cup in Dambulla. India decimated Sri Lanka on that occasion, so the Lankans would be looking to set the record straight. I'm Shashank who would be bringing you all the live action as it unfolds along with my colleagues Ajith, Sid V and Srivathsa.
