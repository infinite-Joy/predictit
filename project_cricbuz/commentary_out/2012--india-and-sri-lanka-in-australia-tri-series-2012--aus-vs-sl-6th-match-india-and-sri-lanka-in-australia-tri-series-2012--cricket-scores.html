Brett Lee will open the attackSo the players are back out in the middle and they are all set for the second innings of this matchSri Lanka have been brilliant with the ball and in the field.

David Hussey scored his 9th ODI fifty and he was given good company by Starc as Australia were all out for 158. Sri Lanka need 152 runs to win according to the D/L method.

We need to finish the games well and we need to avoid mistakes. We need to be perfect in all three departments. Upul Tharanga is out and Lahiru Thirimanne comes in. Senanayake is out and Maharoof comes in. We have chased well in the past.Ponting: We will bat. It is good to be back leading the side. There is a little bit of grass on the wicket but the ball will come on nicely to the bat. Brett Lee replaces Ryan Harris and Michael Hussey replaces Clarke. Xavier Doherty is fine.Australia have won the toss and elected to batInteresting Trivia: This is the venue where Wasim Akram took his 400th ODI wicket.Pitch Report: There is some grass on this track and it has been rolled in. The new ball will swing for the first 10-15 overs and then it will be a good batting track with even bounce. The weather has been great and the surface underneath is dry. The team that wins the toss should bat first.Sri Lanka have had good success against Australia in the recent past at the SCG. In the last three games played here between these two teams at this venue, Sri Lanka have won all three. They will be hoping that the trend continues even today.Michael Clarke is not playing in this match due to a hamstring injury. Ricky Ponting will be leading the side today. It will be his first match in charge since the quarter-final match against India at Ahmedabad during the 2011 World Cup.Welcome to the 6th match of the CB series between Australia and Sri Lanka from the SCG. This is a must win game for the Sri Lankans, while for Australia, a win for them will push them to the top of the table.Preview by Shashreek RoySri Lanka have been involved in quite a few close encounters throughout the CB series, however, the 'Islanders' haven't been able to acquire that invaluable commodity called luck. As a result, Sri Lanka find themselves at the bottom of the table with just two points against their names. The visitors will be desperate to get themselves a victory when they meet Australia in the 6th ODI of the tournament, because if they don't then they certainly run the risk of going home with nothing more than a certificate of participation.Australia on the other hand are riding on a high after a fairly good summer. The hosts have carried the form they displayed in the Test series into this long drawn out tri-series and find themselves second on the table with 9 points and the highest net run rate. Although they have been knocked off the perch for the moment, they do have a game in hand and will be looking to make the most out of that when they take on Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka:Three matches into the tournament and Sri Lanka don't have too many positives to look back at apart from a nail biting tied match that earned them two points against India. The atmosphere in the dressing room might just be hitting a slight low and the Lankans will have to find a way to pick themselves up.The last time these two sides met, the game went into the last over and Sri Lanka nearly snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, courtesy a spectacular 64 from Angelo Matthews. Sri Lanka on that occasion lacked the ability to capitalize on starts and failed to put together enough partnerships in the lower middle order. This time though, the visitors will be eager to avenge that five run loss and will certainly want to bat a lot better than they did earlier.Sri Lanka's bowling department hasn't really faltered in the tournament so far and in fact it was their bowlers who earned them those two points against their neighbours. The attack does look very balanced with the pace of Lasith Malinga, the variety of Matthews and the guile of Senanayake. In fact Malinga has been amongst the top wicket takers in the tournament and has been Sri Lanka's best bet with five wickets in three matches.There is a lot at stake for the 'Islanders' in this match. It is more than just a matter of vengeance. If Sri Lanka lose this one, then they might have to aim at winning everything to be certain to qualify for the final, a steep task by all means. After finally having opened their points tally in the last game against India, the visitors will want to keep the momentum going and will certainly like to register their first win of the tournament.Australia:After a couple of victories that saw them start off as the undoubted favourites of the tournament, Australia have suffered a slight hiccup at the hands of India. The hosts though, will want to nip that habit in the bud and will want to ensure that they reclaim that favourites tag.With just one loss in the tournament, Australia has been the dominant force and that has shown in the fact that they are the only team to have won with a bonus point and are the only team to have a positive net run rate. Their bowling has been their strength and Clint McKay has proved to be a real handful for the oppositions. The 28 year old has already shown that he has a lot of tricks up his sleeve and that he can change his pace with great effect courtesy a well disguised back of the hand slower delivery.One man who has supported McKay very well in the wickets column is the left arm orthodox Xavier Doherty. It is rather unfortunate though that the youngster has been suffering back spasms that could see him miss the game against the Lankans. With a tally of six wickets, Doherty's injury certainly means that the Australians will lose out on a powerful resource, however, it doesn't spell doom for the hosts just yet. Jon Holland, the left arm orthodox who plays for Victoria, has been creating quite a stir in the domestic circuit and his recent six wicket haul against South Australia is probably what has influenced the selectors to call him up as a cover for Doherty.Australia if anything will want to improve the way they have batted so far. The hosts have just one man in the list of top five run scorers, David Hussey, and they clearly found themselves a few runs short when they lost to India. Ricky Ponting has been the real hole in the batting order for Australia, with just nine runs in three matches. The former captain is under the scanner again and there will be added pressure on him as he leads the team in Michael Clarke's absence.A few changes are in store for the Aussies. Micheal Hussey might find his way back into the squad to replace the injured Clarke and Holland might just make his debut for Australia if Doherty isn't fit. Australia will be eager to get back to winning ways and will surely want that spot at the top of the table.Final Word:Australia have looked a class apart in the CB series and will surely go into this fixture as the favourites. Sri Lanka on the other hand have looked quite woeful in the series so far and are slowly becoming merely an added attraction to the tournament rather than competitors. The visitors will be desperate for a win but they might find themselves a little short on quality to come out on top.
