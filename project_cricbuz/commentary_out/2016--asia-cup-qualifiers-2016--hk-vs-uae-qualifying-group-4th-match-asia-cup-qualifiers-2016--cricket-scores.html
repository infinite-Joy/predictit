Led by Tanwir Afzal, Hong Kong are coming into this tournament having played a drawn T20I series against Scotland in Mong Kok.The bowlers were really impressive in the first game and kept the visitors to just 66 for 7 in ten overs in a truncated clash before the batsmen joined the party and chased it down with over three overs to spare.What will bother Hong Kong the most is that the team isn't clicking as a unit. In their game against Oman, it was Babar Hayat's 60-ball 122 that took the team close. The second best performance came from Aizaz Khan, who scored 15.Nadeem Ahmed picked up 3 for 27 in the last game and the bowling is expected to revolve around him.Going into the match, UAE emerges clear favourites but Hong Kong, after a moral boosting performance against Scotland, will be eyeing another upset to show what they are capable of and keep their campaign on track.?Teams:United Arab Emirates (From): Rohan Mustafa, Muhammad Kaleem, Shaiman Anwar, Amjad Javed(c), Mohammad Usman, Mohammad Shahzad, Usman Mushtaq, Ahmed Raza, Swapnil Patil(w), Farhan Ahmed, Mohammad Naveed, Zaheer Maqsood, Qadeer Ahmed, Saqlain Haider, Fahad TariqHong Kong (From): Anshuman Rath, Kinchit Shah, Babar Hayat, Mark Chapman, Nizakat Khan, Tanwir Afzal(c), Aizaz Khan, Waqas Khan, Haseeb Amjad, Christopher Carter(w), Nadeem Ahmed, Tanveer Ahmed, Adil Mehmood, Ninad Shah, Waqas BarkatLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
