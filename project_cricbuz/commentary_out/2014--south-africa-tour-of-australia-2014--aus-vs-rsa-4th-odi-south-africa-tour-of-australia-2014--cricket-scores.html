South Africa have never lost to Australia at the MCG. Can Australia change this record and take an unassailable 3-1 lead? We will find out soon.The Australian pacers were brilliant with their slower ones, bouncers and yorkers. They didn't even miss Coulter-Nile, who pulled a hamstring and bowled just three overs. Maxwell too did a pretty decent job. It is now upto their batsmen to chase this down and win them the series. Can South Africa defend this total? Join us back in a short while to find out...Australia will be quite pleased with their bowling effort. They gave away only 51 runs in the last 10 overs and managed to pick up 4 wickets. South Africa did not get going at the start as Amla and de Kock went early. Faf threw away yet another start in the series and it was left to ABD to do the damage control once again. Miller supported him well and the pair added 122 runs for the 4th wicket. However, Australia picked up both at the right time to put the brakes on the scoring.4

For Australia, Maxwell, Coulter-Nile, Faulkner and Cummins come in place of Marsh, Richardson, Doherty and Hazlewood. For South Africa, McLaren, Peterson, Parnell and Abbott replace Rossouw, Philander, Morkel and Tahir.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Ryan McLaren, Robin Peterson, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Kyle AbbottAustralia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Steven Smith, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, Pat Cummins, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Mitchell StarcSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to batThe Proteas' bowling attack lacked the instinct to go for the kill in the last game. They will have to chalk out a plan to keep the Australian batters at bay. Can South Africa make a rousing come back in the series? Or will Australia go on to win the series? We will get to know soon. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.Hello and welcome to the 4th ODI between Australia and South Africa being played at Melbourne. In the last ODI, Australia rode on the batting performances of Finch and Smith and posted a big total on the board. Even though South Africa started with a 108-run stand for the opening wicket and were 224/3 at one stage, they lost their next 6 wickets for just 32 runs. This collapse brought an end to the proceedings and Australia emerged victorious by 73 runs. In the last game, Imran Tahir didn't come out to bat after he strained his knee while fielding. So, there's some doubt regarding whether he will start or not.With just two games to go and with Australia being 2-1 up in the series, the series is interestingly poised. South Africa will have to win this game to take the series to a decider. At the same time, Australia would want to finish things off. If they win today's game, they will take an unassailable lead of 3-1.Preview by PradeepAfter the bowlers had their say at the WACA in Perth, it was the time for the batsmen to make merry on a placid surface at the Manuka Oval in Canberra. With the upcoming 2015 World Cup the main focus for both teams, experimentation has been the order of the day.On that front, Australia have done much better when compared to their South African counterparts. In the absence of JP Duminy, skipper, AB de Villiers, pushed himself down to number five in the batting order, offering Rilee Rossouw and Farhaan Behardien, the opportunity to prove themselves. Both batsmen haven't made the most of it though, although Behardien did turn out to be a useful option with the ball.With the series slipping away, South Africa might well revert to their best combination. Will de Villiers bat higher up the order? Will South Africa play an extra pacer? There are plenty of questions for which the tourists need answers.AustraliaThe hosts have managed to tick all the correct boxes. Twice in the series, they have gone past the 300 mark. The two openers, Aaron Finch and David Warner, have looked at ease, and have more often than not, laid solid platforms for the rest of the batting unit. The middle-order has looked in excellent touch. Steven Smith, playing only as a replacement for captain, Michael Clarke, showed his prowess in Canberra, making a match-winning 73. The all-rounders, Shane Watson and Mitchell Marsh, have chipped in usefully, both, with the bat as well as the ball.With plenty of runs in the bank, the bowlers have been able to sustain the pressure on the visiting batsmen. Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock were solid during the chase of 330 in Canberra. But once the partnership ended, the Aussies strengthened their hold, and even a superb cameo from AB de Villiers wasn't enough to secure victory. Australian captain, Michael Clarke, has asked for a settled World Cup combination to feature in the triangular series in January, and that leaves the hopefuls with just the last two matches in this series to prove their credentials.South AfricaThe visitors are struggling to arrive at the best possible combination despite playing their strongest side. The absence of JP Duminy has forced skipper, AB de Villiers, to bat at number five. Rilee Rossouw has been a huge disappointment, so has been Farhaan Behardien. With the series on the line, de Villiers might be back to his number four batting spot. The rest of the batting unit looks secured, although David Miller is seemingly wasted at seven.The visitors went in with a four-bowler strategy for the first three matches, relying on Behardien and AB de Villiers, for the final set of 10 overs. They might be tempted to bring in an extra pace option for the final two matches, meaning one of Rossouw/Behardien might need to sit out.Team NewsImran Tahir sprained his knees while fielding in the third ODI at Canberra and is a doubtful starter. If he is ruled out, Robin Peterson, might be drafted in. Kyle Abbott might be added to bolster the pace attack.For Australia, Pat Cummins is most likely to feature in the fourth match at the MCG. In that case, one of the pacers is likely to be rested QuotesIt's a real positive when you have guys challenging for spots, because it's driving you to perform well: Aaron Finch, on competition for places in the squad for the World Cup.There were small basics that we got wrong which cost us the game today: AB de Villiers reflects on South Africa's inability to chase down the target in Canberra.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Robin Peterson, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Kyle Abbott, Morne Morkel, Farhaan Behardien, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Imran TahirAustralia (From): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Steven Smith, George Bailey(c), Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, Xavier Doherty, Josh Hazlewood, Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat CumminsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
