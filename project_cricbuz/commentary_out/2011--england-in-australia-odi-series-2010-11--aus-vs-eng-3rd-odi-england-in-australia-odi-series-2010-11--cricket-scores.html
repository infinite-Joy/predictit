Two weeks ago, one would have fancied England to be on top in this ODI series. However, Australia have shown that they have not lost the urge to win. Shaun Marsh's century in the previous ODI at Hobart helped Australia consolidate their grip in the series. But, their win came at a cost with Nathan Hauritz being ruled out for the rest of the series with a dislocated right shoulder.Teams:Australia (From): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Michael Clarke(c), Cameron White, David Hussey, Shaun Marsh, Steven Smith, Brett Lee, Xavier Doherty, Peter Siddle, Doug Bollinger, Shaun TaitEngland (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Matt Prior(w), Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan, Michael Yardy, Luke Wright, Chris Woakes, Chris Tremlett, Ajmal Shahzad, Paul Collingwood, Tim Bresnan, Steve Davies, Steven Finn, Graeme Swann, James Tredwell, James AndersonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
