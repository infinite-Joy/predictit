Nehra will open the attackWelcome back for the NZ reply, it was the shortest lunch interval I have seen!Virat Kohli is surely becoming one of the stars in ODI cricket for India. His century helped India reach 276, but NZ will not be too unhappy with this score. At one point, with Kohli and Yuvraj at the crease, it looked like 300 would be possible but Andy McKay's double wicket maiden brought NZ back into the contest. The NZ bowlers kept things tight in the end and wrested the initiative back from India. However, Yusuf Pathan, India's finisher, struck some huge blows to dent the confidence of the Kiwis. Will NZ chase this target down or will the Indian spinners trouble them? Join us at 12:30 PM IST for the run chase.....4

INDIA:8.6  Mills to Kohli, no run, Kohli gets forward and defends it to the on side
INDIA:8.5  Mills to Kohli, no run, Oh dear, it's all happenening! Loud appeal, the Kiwis were absolutely convinced, it was bowled off the scrambled seam, nips back in sharply from outside off, there was a sound as the ball went past the bat, it rushed through between the bat and the pad, did it kiss the bat? Replays should confirm things, but the sound may have been of the bat hitting the pad, Mills can't believe it!

INDIA:7.1  Tuffey to Vijay, out Caught by Hopkins!! That's an important break-through.

Gareth Hopkins says it's mine, runs back and keeps eyes on ball, pouches it safely! Looks like Vijay got a bit carried away. Vijay c Hopkins b Tuffey 29(32) [4s-5] Tuffey to Vijay, THATS OUT!!

Mills will open the attackEarly start as we are playing in the north-eastern part of India. The sun usually sets by around 4:30 PM over here. Session 1: 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM Lunch Break: 12:00 PM to 12:30 PM Session 2: 12:30 PM to 4:00 PMTeams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Jamie How, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor(c), Scott Styris, Kane Williamson, Grant Elliott, Gareth Hopkins(w), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Daryl Tuffey, Andy McKayIndia (Playing XI): Murali Vijay, Gautam Gambhir(c), Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashish Nehra, S Sreesanth, Munaf PatelCaptains' comments:Gambhir: It is a big opportunity for the youngsters and hopefully, they step up and perform. It is a matter of 6-7 overs, and I hope we get some runs on board. We have quality spinners, it's all about going out there and performing.Ross Taylor: Vettori is not fully fit, he is rested. McCullum is not fit either. They miss out today. We have to get some ideal preparation leading into the WC.New Zealand have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch report: The ball will move around early, there is some old grass on the wicket, but it is rolled nicely. As the day goes on, there will be some turn. Remember, the last time a game was played here, India were 5/27 against Australia while batting first. So win the toss, bowl first pitch..Arun Lal: With the WC coming, this will be a terrific experience for the youngsters, we need a reserve bench, an experienced reserve bench rather. Vijay is a gifted player, he has played well in the T20s, hope he performs at this stage. Gambhir scored some runs in the previous game, and he'll be looking forward to leading the side.Danny Morrison feels this is the perfect opportunity for NZ to get back to form before the WC. Coming back to the new look Indian side, there are a number of youngsters who have made their name in the T20 format. Time to prove their mettle? I'm all excited, hope you guys too are. Clear skies in Guwhati, toss at 8:00 AM IST and the game kicks off at 8:30 AM IST.Good morning folks, a hearty welcome to one and all. The big guns are missing as far as India is concerned but this will be a litmus test for the youngsters to cement their place in the squad before the World Cup. New Zealand, who exceeded everybody's expectations by salvaging draws in the first two Tests, will be looking to gain early momentum and make use of the depleted Indian squad. Yuvraj Singh will have a point or two to prove to the selectors as the Gautam Gambhir led 'Men in Blue' lock horns with Vettori's 'Black Caps'. This is Ajith and I will bring you all the action along with Shashank and Sid V. Stay tuned for player interviews and expert comments...By Saurabh SomaniBefore the Test series between India and New Zealand began, what had most people predicting a 3-0 whitewash for India was the fact that New Zealand had been blanked 4-0 by Bangladesh just before landing in India. New Zealand, however, proved that ODI form was not related to Test match form and fought well for a majority of the series before succumbing.However, now we are at the ODIs, and New Zealand have not won an ODI in the past 8 matches that they have played (6 losses, 2 abandoned). This string includes a 105-run loss to India in Sri Lanka, but they can take slight solace from the fact that their last win was a comprehensive 200-run one earlier in the same tournament, against the same opponents - India. The fact that was also obscured by the screaming 4-0 headlines versus Bangladesh was that three of those ODIs were very narrow defeats for New Zealand - twice by 9 runs and once by 3 runs. It is not, therefore, that they have suddenly become a very poor ODI side from a competitive one. It is, however, undeniable that they have been sub-par, and that the pressure on them to raise their game is more acute.It is also New Zealand's last series in the subcontinent before the World Cup, but they are unlikely to tinker with too much of the core of Vettori, Taylor, Mills, the McCullums and Williamson. However there is one key person missing in the Kiwi lineup - Jesse Ryder's calf injury has forced him to fly back home, and provided a good opportunity for his replacement James Franklin to make a case for himself.India, on the other hand, have still not hit upon a settled combination for the World Cup, and they will also be looking at this series to take further steps towards that. Of the Test series winning squad, only Gambhir, Raina, Murali Vijay and Sreesanth remain. The most interest will centre around how the players who are not certainties in the final XI of a full-strength India perform - and with his recent dip in fortunes, Yuvraj Singh should probably count himself as one among them. He will be competing with the likes of Virat Kohli and Murali Vijay for a top-order slot, while the lower-order slot has Saurabh Tiwary, Yusuf Pathan and Ravindra Jadeja as the claimants.The man who might be the most promising of the lot though is Ravichandran Ashwin. He has played just 2 ODIs so far, but has shown good promise during the IPL, being used by Dhoni inside the power plays. He also is a competent enough bat, and could be a very useful bowling all-rounder in a full-strength Indian XI. In the subcontinent - where the World Cup is scheduled - India might anyway opt for two spinners in the eleven, and with Harbhajan's place secure, it would help India to have two of their bowlers with batting abilities down the order.This will also be a good test of Gautam Gambhir's leadership abilities. He has so far come across as a thoughtful, but sometimes too-intense cricketer. Those are good qualities to possess, and with time, he is likely to make his intensity more focussed and less all-consuming, which will only make him a better leader.It promises to be a series full of points to prove at an individual and team level for both sides, and with the added rider of the nearing World Cup - one that will not be lacking in intensity at any point.Teams:India (From): Gautam Gambhir(c), Murali Vijay, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravichandran Ashwin, S Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma, Ashish Nehra, Saurabh Tiwary, Jaidev Unadkat, Ravindra Jadeja, Munaf Patel, Vinay KumarNew Zealand (From): Jamie How, Brendon McCullum(w), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Kane Williamson, James Franklin, Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Daryl Tuffey, Grant Elliott, Gareth Hopkins, Andy McKay, Tim SoutheeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
