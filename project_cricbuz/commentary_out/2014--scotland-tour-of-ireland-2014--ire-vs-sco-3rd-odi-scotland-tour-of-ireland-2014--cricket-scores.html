Apparently, the outfield is still very damp.The bad news is that it is still foggy at the ground and we will have a slight delay, but the good news is that the sun is trying to peep out and the umpire's will have an inspection at 10:00 local time. We'll keep you updated of all that's happening out there, stay tuned..."It is disappointing not to have had many runs on the board," said Richie Berrington after scoring a sensational hundred in the last game. It is quite clear that Scotland aren't quite managing to get runs for their bowlers to come into play. However, their performance in the second ODI was much better as they had Ireland in a spot of bother at one stage. On the other hand, the hosts will be quite happy with their show in the last two games. Skipper Kevin O'Brien has been brilliant with the bat and he registered his second consecutive fifty of the series. Ireland's new ball bowlers have put the ball in the right areas and have made life really difficult for Scotland's top-order. So overall, they will be keen to put up a fine all-round show today and sweep the series. Are we going to see any changes in the line-ups for this 3rd ODI? We'll find out in a while...Teams:Ireland (From): Andrew Balbirnie, John Anderson, Andrew Poynter, Kevin O'Brien(c), Stuart Thompson, Stuart Poynter(w), John Mooney, Andrew White, Max Sorensen, Andy McBrine, Craig Young, Graeme McCarter, George DockrellScotland (From): Matthew Cross(w), Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Freddie Coleman, Josh Davey, Michael A Leask, Majid Haq, Alasdair Evans, Iain Wardlaw, Matt Machan, Safyaan SharifLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
