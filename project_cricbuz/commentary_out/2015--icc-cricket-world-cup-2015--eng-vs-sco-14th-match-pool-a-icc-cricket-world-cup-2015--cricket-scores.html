SCOTLAND:33.6 Finn to Haq, no run, goes round the wicket for the left-hander, pitches it up outside off, Haq drives and picks out mid-offMajid Haq, left handed bat, comes to the creaseFor a brief period, Scotland gained a bit of momentum and on this flat deck, they still seemed to have an outside chance of upsetting the apple-cart and defeating England. Unfortunately, Mommsen, Scotland's captain, was dismissed by Joe Root and to make it worse for them, Moeen Ali landed the decisive blow by snaffling Coetzer's wicket. For England, Steven Finn bowled with brisk pace and extracted bounce, and Moeen yet again made crucial breakthroughs.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 17 overs: Kyle Coetzer and Preston Mommsen gave a good account of themselves by cracking a flurry of boundaries during the middle part of the innings. If Coetzer used the crease against the English bowlers to keep the scorecard moving then, Mommsen, with nimble footwork, played a few excellent shots down the ground while facing up to the spinners. Mommsen also used the sweep shot to keep the spinners guessing. Time for a drinks break!
SCOTLAND:33.5 Finn to Davey, out Caught by Buttler!! Finn has certainly put the horrors of the previous game behind him. He picks up his second wicket.

SCOTLAND:17.1 Finn to Mommsen, 1 run, fullish and on the pads, Mommsen flicks it to square leg for a singleDrinks are on the field now.In fact, Anderson swung the new ball for a few overs and should have taken the wicket of Coetzer too, but Ian Bell couldn't hold onto a chance at second slip. Chris Woakes, then followed up by snaffling the wicket of Freddie Coleman, with Steven Finn sending Scotland's main batsman Matt Machan back to the pavilion. It has to be said that Woakes has been England's best bowler on show as he has bowled with good disciplines. The track is flat and that can be encapsulated by the way Coetzer thwacked Anderson through the line and over the mid-wicket region to collect four runs in the fifth over of the innings. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: Kyle Coetzer showed his ability to play well off the back foot by essaying crunching shots. England though, took wickets at regular intervals to gain the upper-hand. Coetzer took a heavy toll on James Anderson's bowling by smashing him for a flurry of boundaries. For England, Anderson took the first wicket by dismissing Calum MacLeod. MacLeod looked to take on Anderson by using his feet, but the England spearhead followed him to produce the edge and snare his wicket.

J Anderson will open the attackEngland's last two 300-plus scores in the World Cup were against India and Ireland. They tied the first one and lost the one against Ireland.Welcome back...The England players are in a huddle. They have got the runs on the board and now need to bowl well to secure their first win in the tournament.For Scotland to give England a run for their money, they need Kyle Coetzer, Richie Berrington, Preston Mommsen and Sussex's middle-order batsman, Matt Machan to fire. On the other hand, the likes of James Anderson and Stuart Broad would be keen to take wickets upfront.For Scotland, Iain Wardlaw, the former Yorkshire seamer and arguably their best pacer since the retirement of John Blain, bowled with good disciplines upfront. Former Derbyshire seamer, Alasdair Evans, known for his nagging accuracy in Scotland's cricketing circles, too bowled with decent control. Davey, the swing bowler, snared four wickets. Haq produced a fine performance and snared the vital scalp of Moeen. In fact, Scotland would rue the fact that Moeen was dropped in the fourth over of the innings by Freddie Coleman off Davey's bowling.Moeen's opening partner, Ian Bell, wasn't at his fluent best. But he and Moeen stitched a fine 172-run opening stand before Bell was dismissed for 54. It was also England's best opening stand in the history of the World Cup. Once Moeen was dismissed, England lost a slew of wickets. But Eoin Morgan and James Taylor helped them to recover. After the fall of Taylor's wicket, Jos Buttler, with his pyrotechnics took over and played crunching shots. In particular, England's coaching staff would be happy with Morgan doing well as he has struggled for runs in recent times. Moeen Ali was the star performer for England as he composed a stroke-filled century to take them to a sizeable score on the board. Moeen essayed a fluent ton, full of booming drives, wristy flicks, eye-catching pulls and sparkling lofted shots. Moeen made his intentions clear by thumping Josh Davey for a couple of boundaries and a six in the fourth over of the innings. He then, took a heavy toll on all the bowlers. He eventually, completed a quickfire hundred by launching Majid Haq, the experienced off-spinner, for a six over the mid-wicket region. Haq though, had the last laugh as he dismissed Moeen for 128. It turned out to be Moeen's highest score in ODIs.4

ENGLAND:34.1 Haq to Ballance, no run, tossed up and on off, Ballance prods forward in defenceMajid Haq [7.0-0-40-0] is back into the attackDrinks are on the field now. England are firmly on the move now. Moeen got past his hundred and has looked to be positive ever since then. Ballance is taking his time to settle then. England look good to post a score of 350 or more.Scotland have tried to test the left-handed batsman with short deliveries, but they just aren't quick enough to trouble Moeen. On the other hand, Moeen's opening partner, Bell, struggled for timing and wasn't at his fluent best. However, he too amassed a fifty before he was dismissed for 54. Scotland desperately need to snare the wicket of Moeen as he is the one, who has taken the chances and has played aggressively.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 17 overs: Scotland's bowlers bowled a touch better during the middle part of the innings. It was Richie Berrington, who finally broke the opening stand by snaring the wicket of Ian Bell. For England, Moeen Ali continued to play eye-catching shots and completed his second hundred in ODIs. He reached his century by launching Majid Haq for a six over the mid-wicket region.

ENGLAND:17.1 Haq to Moeen Ali, 1 run, very full outside off, Moeen Ali gets forward and drives to sweeper coverDrinks time. England utterly dominant. Scotland look very ordinary with the ball. A huge score is on the cardsAmong the Scotland seamers, Wardlaw, arguably their best pacer since John Blain retired from international cricket, bowled with decent control. However, Davey was inconsistent. The white new Kookaburra ball swung, but Scotland's pacers struggled to bowl line and length. To make it worse for them, Freddie Coleman dropped a tough chance off Davey's bowling to give Moeen a reprieve. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: After Scotland won the toss and opted to bowl, England got off to a fine start. It was Moeen Ali, known for playing well-timed shots, who opened up his shoulders to essay booming drives. Moeen also lofted Josh Davey over mid-off for a six and followed it up by pulling the former Yorkshire seamer, Iain Wardlaw, in front of square for a boundary. Ian Bell, Moeen's opening partner, began his innings on a cautious note before pulling Alasdair Evans for a four. When the experienced off-spinner, Majid Haq, was introduced into the attack, Moeen thwacked a long hop over wide long-on for a six. Moeen, then reached his fifty in a mere 39 deliveries.

ENGLAND:8.6 , replays are in and Davey has dropped Bell. That was hit uppishly and it carried to the bowler. Got a finger on it, but couldn't cling on. So that will go down as a dropped chance1
ENGLAND:11.6 Haq to Bell, 1 run, Bell goes on the back foot and works that middle stump delivery to square leg
ENGLAND:11.5 Haq to Bell, no run, nearly chipped to short mid-wicket, Bell getting forward and almost finding the fielder, it lands on the bounce in front of the diving fielderA leg slip in place for Bell now
ENGLAND:11.4 Haq to Moeen Ali, 1 run, much better, full and floaty outside off, driven to deep extra cover
ENGLAND:11.3 Haq to Moeen Ali, SIX, Moeen Ali had an age and a half to hit that long hop. It hung in the air and came so slowly off the pitch, Moeen Ali could've hit it anywhere he liked, he rocked back and pulled it over wide long-on. That was a gift from Haq
ENGLAND:11.2 Haq to Moeen Ali, no run, slower and on the stumps, Moeen Ali reads it off the pitch and defends off the back foot
ENGLAND:11.1 Haq to Moeen Ali, 2 runs, very slow and short outside off, Moeen Ali bottom-edges the cut, right through the keeper's legs, they take a coupleMajid Haq, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
ENGLAND:10.6 Davey to Moeen Ali, 1 run, tucked wide of mid-on for a single
ENGLAND:10.5 Davey to Bell, 1 run, pitched up outside off, driven well to sweeper cover, for a single
ENGLAND:10.4 Davey to Bell, no run, on a good length and outside off, Bell gets forward and defends to short cover
ENGLAND:10.4 Davey to Bell, wide, full and down leg, wide called
ENGLAND:10.3 Davey to Bell, no run, and again! Bell took a step out to counter the movement, but this delivery was similar to the last one, it nipped away a tad to miss the outside edge, two peaches from Davey in a row. Very unlucky not to get a wicket
ENGLAND:10.2 Davey to Bell, no run, cracker of a ball that one. Angled in and straightens, Bell was pushing inside the line and the extra bounce takes it over the blade, didn't miss off by much. Bell has a puzzled look after getting beaten
ENGLAND:10.1 Davey to Moeen Ali, 1 run, on a back of a length and outside off, Moeen Ali gets forward and times the drive to sweeper cove
ENGLAND:9.6 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, 1 run, angled in, on the hips, nudged to fine leg
ENGLAND:9.5 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, no run, presses forward and solidly defends to mid-off
ENGLAND:9.4 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, FOUR, Moeen Ali is severe on anything short today, hip-height short ball, no real pace too and Moeen pulls over mid-wicket. So easy
ENGLAND:9.3 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, no run, nudged to mid-wicket
ENGLAND:9.2 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, FOUR, edged and wide of the diving short gully fielder. Alasdair Evans produced the edge as Moeen Ali went for a drive, third man dived to his right but it was a poor effort and he allowed the ball to miss his grasp
ENGLAND:9.1 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, no run, nips back in and Moeen Ali is forward to push, but it runs off a thick inside half to the left of the bowler
ENGLAND:8.6 Davey to Bell, no run, did that carry back to Davey? Bell punched a drive in the air, Davey was in his followthrough and the ball went through his hands, need a replay to know whether carried or not
ENGLAND:8.5 Davey to Bell, no run, much more solid. Gets forward and defends solidly to cover
ENGLAND:8.4 Davey to Bell, no run, iffy stroke from Bell and he is beaten, pitched up outside off, Bell went for a cross-batted drive and the ball went under the bat
ENGLAND:8.3 Davey to Moeen Ali, 1 run, Machan at mid-off does well to keep that well-timed punch to just a single, the ball was going wide of him and he sprinted and dived full length to his right to stop
ENGLAND:8.2 Davey to Bell, 3 runs, floating half-volley on the pads, flicked wide of mid-on, the fielder from deep mid-wicket gets across and prevents the boundary. They run three, good aggressive running
ENGLAND:8.1 Davey to Bell, no run, yorker length on off, dug out by BellJosh Davey [2.0-0-20-0] is back into the attack
ENGLAND:7.6 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, no run, nips back in appreciably and moves past the flick of Moeen Ali, strikes him on the thigh pad, no real appeal from the Scots as it would've missed leg by a distance
ENGLAND:7.5 Alasdair Evans to Bell, 1 run, Bell was late in leaving that and the ball takes the face of the bat while Bell was shaping to let it go, down to third man
ENGLAND:7.4 Alasdair Evans to Bell, no run, pitched up outside off, Bell defends to point
ENGLAND:7.3 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, 1 run, angling in from round the wicket, into the pads, clipped away to fine leg
ENGLAND:7.2 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, no run, from round the wicket and back of a length outside off, Moeen Ali strokes it straight to the fielder at cover
ENGLAND:7.1 Alasdair Evans to Bell, 1 run, 'push, push' was the call from Bell as he nudged it towards deep backward square, but the fielder charged in and kept it to a single
ENGLAND:6.6 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Bell opens the face of the bat and dabs it to the left of the diving backward point. The call was for 'wait on' initially, but once the ball went past the fielder, they take a single
ENGLAND:6.5 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, pitched up outside off, swings away, Bell lets it go
ENGLAND:6.4 Iain Wardlaw to Moeen Ali, 1 run, back of a length on the stumps, nudged in front of short mid-wicket, which is vacant
ENGLAND:6.3 Iain Wardlaw to Moeen Ali, FOUR, that is a cracking pull shot. Iain Wardlaw going short and Moeen Ali rocking back to hammer a pull in front of square, no chance for the fielder running to his right at deep mid-wicket
ENGLAND:6.2 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, 3 runs, too short and outside off, Bell doesn't time the pull, but hits the gap, good enough for three as a bit of tag-team work from Scotland ensues
ENGLAND:6.1 Iain Wardlaw to Moeen Ali, 1 run, short of length outside off, Moeen Ali punches past the gully to third man
ENGLAND:5.6 Alasdair Evans to Bell, no run, another nip-backer and Alasdair Evans has Bell in trouble. This one cuts back in and misses the inside edge, strikes Bell on the thigh pad, would've gone over. Nippy delivery from Evans
ENGLAND:5.5 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, 1 run, nips back in a tad, Moeen Ali turns it gently into the gap at mid-wicket for a single
ENGLAND:5.5 Alasdair Evans to Moeen Ali, wide, from round the wicket to Moeen Ali, full and wide outside off, very wide in fact and called a wide

ENGLAND:5.3 Alasdair Evans to Bell, no run, short and wide outside off, Bell cuts, but stopped at backward point with a dive
ENGLAND:5.2 Alasdair Evans to Bell, no run, that was close! Nips back in and keeps low, Bell is rapped on the pads, but that would've missed leg. So a good call from Rod Tucker. Snicko shows no inside edge onto the pads, but the angle would've taken it down. Hawk-Eye shows it was umpire's call. Good job that Scotland didn't reviewAre Scotland going to review this? No they aren't!
ENGLAND:5.1 Alasdair Evans to Bell, FOUR, a loosener from Alasdair Evans and that has been pulled away to deep backward square leg, Bell swivelling on the shot and timing it well, the ball raced away to the fence in a jiffyAlasdair Evans, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
ENGLAND:4.6 Iain Wardlaw to Moeen Ali, no run, short of length on the stumps, Moeen Ali hops a little and defends to backward point
ENGLAND:4.5 Iain Wardlaw to Moeen Ali, no run, pitched up on the stumps, Moeen Ali drives and finds mid-off
ENGLAND:4.4 Iain Wardlaw to Moeen Ali, no run, on the middle and leg stump line, Moeen Ali nudges it to mid-wicket
ENGLAND:4.4 Iain Wardlaw to Moeen Ali, wide, wide down leg, Moeen Ali pulls and misses
ENGLAND:4.3 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, 1 run, it wasn't short enough to be pulled, but Bell fetched it from outside off and got it to the right of mid-on, easy single
ENGLAND:4.2 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, short of length and shaping away from outside off, Bell sees it and shoulders arms
ENGLAND:4.1 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, back of a length outside off, left alone
ENGLAND:3.6 Davey to Moeen Ali, SIX, that's a shot and a half. Davey has been guilty of pitching it up far too often in the over and Moeen Ali just is timing the drives superbly. This one is just nonchalantly lifted over mid-off. The timing was so great that it carried all the way. The bat swing from Moeen Ali was a sight to behold. Such grace and poise in the stroke
ENGLAND:3.5 Davey to Moeen Ali, no run, pitched up outside off, Moeen Ali plays a square drive and it's intercepted by a diving point to his left
ENGLAND:3.4 Davey to Moeen Ali, no run, well-hit drive, but straight to the fielder at mid-off, Moeen Ali timing these drives well at the moment
ENGLAND:3.3 Davey to Moeen Ali, FOUR, deliberately hit over point. Moeen Ali saw the fuller length delivery outside off and sliced it up and over point
ENGLAND:3.2 Davey to Moeen Ali, no run, is that dropped? Looks like it. Moeen Ali went hard on the drive and it went to cover, was dropping on Freddie Coleman, who couldn't gather the low chance, the ball went under his hands and went to ground. Should've taken that, even though it wasn't an easy chance
ENGLAND:3.1 Davey to Moeen Ali, FOUR, nice shot by Moeen Ali. Davey pitches it up outside off, Moeen Ali opens the face of the bat and plays a nice square drive into the gap at cover, the fielder makes a spirited chase and dives head-first into the ad-hoardings, but the ball wins the race
ENGLAND:2.6 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, pitched up outside off, Bell gets forward and drives straight to the fielder at mid-off. That's a maiden over by Iain Wardlaw

ENGLAND:2.2 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, nudged in front of mid-on
ENGLAND:2.1 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, Bell looks to pull and completely mistimes the shot, the short ball got big on him, he rolled his wrists to keep it down and it went off the splice straight to the fielder at mid-wicket
ENGLAND:1.6 Davey to Moeen Ali, no run, that was the delivery he was looking for all over and has found it off the last ball. Pitched up outside off, the angle away from Moeen Ali lured him into the cover drive, the ball landed a foot short of the shot and missed the outside edge. Nice ball to finish off a pretty poor over
ENGLAND:1.6 Davey to Moeen Ali, wide, further outside off, swings away even more, wide called
ENGLAND:1.5 Davey to Moeen Ali, no run, pitched up outside off and Moeen Ali for an instant wanted to go for the cover drive, decided against it in the end
ENGLAND:1.4 Davey to Moeen Ali, no run, nicely timed, but straight to the fielder at mid-off, Moeen Ali playing the front foot punchy drive
ENGLAND:1.4 Davey to Moeen Ali, wide, poor over from Davey so far. Drifts it down leg and Moeen Ali lets it goNothing on Snicko for that caught behind appeal
ENGLAND:1.3 Davey to Moeen Ali, no run, on a length and outside off, angling away, left alone
ENGLAND:1.3 Davey to Moeen Ali, wide, down leg and Moeen Ali flicks and misses. Davey and the keeper thought there was a tiny feather, they go up but Rod Tucker isn't fooled, he stretches his arms out wide to signal a wide
ENGLAND:1.3 Davey to Moeen Ali, wide, way outside off and that's an easy call for wide
ENGLAND:1.2 Davey to Moeen Ali, 2 runs, flicked off the pads and the call was for 'two', the fumble from the deep mid-wicket fielder makes the batsmen's job easyTwo slips in place for Davey too
ENGLAND:1.1 Davey to Moeen Ali, no run, on a good length and on the stumps, Moeen Ali defends to coverJosh Davey, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
ENGLAND:0.6 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, Bell gets a good stride forward and drives into the gap at cover, the ball is stopped by the chasing fielder and Bell will get off the mark with that couple
ENGLAND:0.5 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, pitched up outside off, swinging away, Bell isn't tempted just yet
ENGLAND:0.4 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, shaping away from outside off, Bell wants another sighter, leaves this one as well
ENGLAND:0.3 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, back of a length and angling away from outside off, Bell shoulders arms, that carried nicely to the keeper
ENGLAND:0.2 Iain Wardlaw to Bell, no run, short of length outside off, defended to point, Bell came down late on it
ENGLAND:0.1 Iain Wardlaw to Moeen Ali, 1 run, nice punchy drive from Moeen Ali, wide of mid-off, who goes to his right and makes a half-stop, is off the mark with that shot. Gentle swing for Iain Wardlaw, nothing moreMoeen Ali and Bell are at the crease. Moeen Ali is on strike. Iain Wardlaw will open the attackThe countdown begins and Finn says 'let's go'. Time for the first ball of the day. Moeen Ali will be on strike. Wardlaw will be the bowler. Two slips in place. Here we go thenThe national anthems are the stage for the players to show their passion. The cherubic Joe Root sings the anthem with a smile and gusto. Surprisingly, Eoin Morgan doesn't sing. He keeps quiet. After the anthems are done, the Scotland team are in a huddle. They break out of it and are followed into the ground by the England openers.Pitch report by Sir Ian Botham: The pitch looks good. It has been used for one game, on Saturday. Tennis ball bounce. You need to pitch it up. Don't bowl too short. Little bit of movement available. Look at what happened to Pakistan, they were 1/4Teams:Scotland (Playing XI): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Freddie Coleman, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Majid Haq, Alasdair Evans, Iain WardlawEngland (Playing XI): Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, James AndersonScotland have won the toss and have opted to fieldMorgan: 'Obviously not an ideal start to our campaign but today is another opportunity for us to turn it around and get things started. I would've had a bowl first. Little bit of overhead conditions suggest it might swing a bit. The wicket looks really good and all reports says it's nice bounce and carry, so we don't mind batting here first. Same team as the first game and the second game. I think the balance of the side and another opportunity for guys to put a performance under their belt is more important than anything. We feel we haven't performed anywhere near our best and to try and sort of rejig the team with guys who haven't performed is very difficult to do, so again, it's a strong side we have put out and a chance to put a performance under their belt. As I said, we have had a slow start and hopefully we would look to turn it around today'Mommsen: 'Yeah this is where we qualified for the World Cup last year in a pressurised game, so very happy to be here. He (Paul Collingwood) has been hugely influential and obviously knows a lot of the England players, so he has given us quite a bit of insight and that's been hugely valuable. We will have a bowl first. Just overhead conditions, I think the wicket shouldn't play too badly. It should be a good one-day wicket, but hopefully get a bit of swing early on. Ally Evans and Freddie Coleman come in for Rob Taylor and Hamish Gardiner. It's always nice to be playing against the neighbours, obviously not a perfect start for them, hopefully we can put them under pressure early on'The news coming in is that England are unchanged. We'll confirm that to you at the tossEngland Cricket have tweeted: Overcast conditions here as our batsmen hit in the nets at back of ground.Weather conditions: Early morning drizzle was on the horizon but it is expected to clear in time for the match. It should be a gloriously sunny afternoon with a nice Northeasterly breeze blowing across the Hagley Oval.On the other hand, Scotland's coach, Grant Bradburn, reckons that the Scots' familiarity with the Christchurch surface will hold them in good stead. "I think that's been a theme for us right the way through. We've had a fantastic buildup right from February last year when the guys played so well here in Christchurch and ended up winning seven in a row to qualify for the World Cup," he said.England's opener, Ian Bell, is under no illusion and says that a positive result might kick-start England's World Cup campaign. "We haven't done that in these two games. We've been well off the pace, so it would be nice to turn up tomorrow and put together the kind of game that we know we can. That's what we've got to do", Bell noted.Scotland: Scotland have never defeated a full member nation in World Cups but they came close to rewriting history when they put up an inspired performance against New Zealand in their first match. After being put in to bat, the Scots were reeling at 4 for 12 at one point. They recovered well from that stage to finish on 142 on the back of Matt Machan and Richie Berrington's gritty half-centuries. While New Zealand were expected to run through the chase, Scotland took a slew of wickets to give the Kiwi side a bit of a scare. Although the Scots eventually ended up on the losing side, their fightback was greatly appreciated.England: England were thrashed both in Melbourne and Welllington by huge margins by Australia and New Zealand, respectively. In the first game, they collapsed in a massive run chase of 343. Despite James Taylor's fighting 98 not out, the English side had nothing to account for. They slipped further in the second match against New Zealand as the Kiwi side bowled them out for a paltry 123. If that was not enough, Brendon McCullum annihilated the English bowling attack, scoring the fastest fifty in World Cup history, eventually smashing 77 off just 25 deliveries. With no points to their name yet and the worst net run rate in the pool, England are currently reeling at the bottom of the table.Let us have a look how these teams have fared in their earlier games in this tournament.However, the Scots aren't any pushovers themselves. The biggest incentive for teams like Scotland and Ireland in a World Cup is a victory against old nemesis, England. Having acquitted creditably against New Zealand, Scotland will hope for a bigger casualty, and on the basis of current form, England seem ripe for the picking.09:45 Local Time, 08:45 GMT, 02:15 IST: It's the clash of the Europeans. England take on Scotland as they seek to restore their World Cup credentials. It has been a bumpy ride for Eoin Morgan and his men. While they weren't expected to beat Australia and New Zealand, the margin of losses in both the games has left England right at the bottom of the table. It has left them with plenty to do. England can't get any worse and if there's a time for redemption, it starts right now.Preview by Jamie AlterIn football, the very mention of England versus Scotland is sufficient to stir the passion in hardcore fans. It is, after all, the oldest international football rivalry, renewed for pride, passion and an infamous pitch invasion at Wembley Stadium in 1977.Not so in cricket, but when Eoin Morgan's England team meets Preston Mommsen's Scotland at Hagley Oval on Monday morning, there will be plenty of interest in the match. For starters, there is the fact that England, having lost to Australia and New Zealand in the World Cup, need to win to put their campaign on track. Second, there is the determination of Mommsen and his team-mates to show that they are not at the tournament as minnows, having earned the right to be at the World Cup early last year. Third, there is the history of political tensions between the two nations.While that last aspect is unlikely to act as motivation for either team, there is definitely determination on either side to take the other out. "Yeah, of course, there's always a huge rivalry between Scotland and England in any sporting event," said Mommsen on the eve of the match. "I've been to Murrayfield for a ScotlandEngland clash, and the passion that's on display there is pretty awesome, and hopefully that'll come out again tomorrow. We're up for this game. We've got a very passionate 15 players there who will fight tooth and nail for every run and try and save every run in the field, as well. We'll be fighting for it tomorrow. There's no doubt about that. We want to win this game and hopefully we can put in a huge performance.Ian Bell, the England opener, spoke of the positivity in the camp and the need to get points on the board. "We've got to put on a good performance. Obviously the result is obviously the most important thing, but it would be nice to put it on with real clinical cricket," he said. "We haven't done that in these two games. We've been well off the pace, so it would be nice to turn up tomorrow and put together the kind of game that we know we can. That's what we've got to do. I think even though what's happened has been so bad, it's irrelevant for what happens tomorrow."England face Scotland at scenic Hagley Oval, a ground at which Mommsen's team won the ICC World Cup Qualifiers last year. They can claim to have experience over England at this venue, for it was here that they defeated the UAE in the final of the qualifying event to seal the third qualification spot for the World Cup, and in the process of that successful run they recorded four of the ten highest team totals as well as four of the highest individual knocks."I think it's definitely an advantage for us," said Mommsen. "I'm not sure whether England have actually played on this ground since it's kind of reopened, and we've played here a number of times in the last 12 months. That is something that we will try and use to our advantage. Generally when we've played here, it's played very well. It's a good oneday wicket. If you get in, it has potential to get big scores, and something we'll be looking for tomorrow is a big partnership up front to lay a steady platform for our innings. It is definitely an advantage for us, and hopefully we can use that tomorrow."Scotland are likely to stick with the same team that tested New Zealand in the field in Dunedin this week, while England could drop Steven Finn, who conceded 49 runs in two overs in the Wellington loss to New Zealand, for Chris Jordan. Jordan had a good hit in the nets, more so than Finn on the adjacent strip. England coach Peter Moores was seen having a long discussion with Ravi Bopara both while bowling and batting, so there is a chance that the allrounder gets a game. Gary Ballance is under the spotlight after a lean run. Alex Hales could be considered.Mommsen could not comment much on the nature of the pitch, but was aware that it would be the same strip used on Saturday, on which West Indies made 310 against Pakistan and then reduced them to 25 for 5 with the ball, with Jerome Taylor and Jason Holder bowling on a tight channel outside off stump. A look at the stats for Hagley Oval shows that in five ODIs played here, three times teams have crossed 300 in the first innings. With a sunny day forecast, getting first use of the pitch would be the way to go.Scotland's coach, the former New Zealand international and Northern Districts coach Grant Bradburn, was also aware of the Scotland v England rival and spoke of how it was important for him to keep some of the Scottish players calm, not letting them get too far ahead of themselves."I think that's been a theme for us right the way through. We've had a fantastic buildup from right from February last year when the guys played so well here in Christchurch and ended up winning seven in a row to qualify for the World Cup," he said. "We've been fortunate to have been handed a very good opportunity to prepare well. A big part of that preparation has been the discovery, really, for us of the formula that works for us. It's having fun and enjoying our environment and enjoying our cricket, sticking to the basics. Definitely two themes that we value highly in everything we do. It's a huge privilege for us to be here."Probable XIsScotland: 1 Kyle Coetzer, 2 Calum MacLeod, 3 Hamish Gardiner, 4 Matt Machan, 5 Preston Mommsen (capt), 6 Richie Berrington, 7 Matthew Cross (wk), 8 Josh Davey, 9 Rob Taylor, 10 Majid Haq, 11 Iain WardlawEngland (possible): 1 Ian Bell, 2 Moeen Ali, 3 Alex Hales, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan (capt), 6 James Taylor, 7 Jos Buttler (wk), 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Chris Jordan, 10 Stuart Broad, 11 James AndersonTeams:Scotland (From): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Rob Taylor, Majid Haq, Iain Wardlaw, Freddie Coleman, Alasdair Evans, Michael Leask, Safyaan SharifEngland (From): Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, James Anderson, Ravi Bopara, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, James TredwellLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
