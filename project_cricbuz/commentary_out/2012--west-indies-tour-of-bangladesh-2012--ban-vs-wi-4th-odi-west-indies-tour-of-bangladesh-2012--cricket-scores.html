The batsmen have to stay longer at the crease. Kemar Roach has replaced Ravi Rampaul in the team. The team has to perform as a total unit to win matches.Rahim says that the dew plays a big factor. There is always pressure on us. Although we lost the last game, we took some positives. Elias Sunny has replaced Rubel Hossain.Pitch Report: It is a dry pitch and the wicket will get slower and lower as the game progresses. The spinners will do the bulk of the bowling.At the Sher-e-Bangla national stadium, dew plays a huge factor in day-night matches. Teams that bat second always have an advantage at this venue.Teams: Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Naeem Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Sohag Gazi, Abdur Razzak, Elias SunnyWest Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Kieran Powell, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Smith, Kieron Pollard, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Veerasammy Permaul, Sunil Narine, Kemar RoachBangladesh have won the toss and elected to fieldWelcome one and all to the fourth ODI between Bangladesh and West Indies from the Sher-e-Bangla national stadium in Mirpur. West Indies won the third ODI by four wickets thanks to a marvellous ton by Marlon Samuels and they have kept themselves alive in the series. Bangladesh will be looking for another opportunity to clinch the series. The toss is just 10 minutes away.Preview by Pradeep It was fair to say that Bangladesh came crashing down to earth after two superb wins at Khulna. Perhaps the change in venue lifted the sagging spirits of the tourists who came back to register a comprehensive victory. With very little time between matches, Bangladesh have very little time to brood over their misfortune as they prepare for the fourth match of the series. Despite the loss at Mirpur, it was heartening to note the way Bangladesh fought in a loosing cause and almost came close to causing ripples in the Windies batting line-up. The bowlers did not seem to be affected by the heavy dew in the outfield, constantly harassing the batsmen with consistent and threatening spin off the surface. Sohag Gazi has been the find of the season for the hosts and he continued to torment the visitors with his clever change of variations. He has been well complemented by the left arm spin of Razzak, the occasional off-spin of Mahmudullah and Naeem Islam as well as a surprise package in Mominul Haque. While the bowling looks covered in all aspects, Bangladesh will hope that the batsmen shed their indifferent form during the third match at Dhaka. Many batsmen got starts but failed to convert it into innings of substance. Anamul Haque continued to impress while Mushfiqur Rahim is showing maturity beyond his years. On the other hand, problems continue to dog West Indies despite their win on Wednesday night. Chris Gayle has looked jaded and the rest of the middle order barring Samuels has looked shaky against spin. The big hitting all-rounders in the middle order, Kieron Pollard and Dwayne Smith have struggled to impose themselves on the bowling. Sunil Narine, one of the biggest disappointments of the tour for the tourists finally redeemed himself with a worthy contribution at Mirpur. With the track offering assistance, Narine may well turn out to be the trump card for the visitors. Team News: Bangladesh The hosts kept faith in the eleven that won two successive games at Khulna and one loss might not prompt drastic actions from the team management. West Indies Dwayne Smith has suffered a lean patch and his lack of technique against spin has been exposed. Lendl Simmons struggled in the first two matches and with Smith offering a bowling option, he might just get another chance to prove his critics wrong.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Naeem Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Sohag Gazi, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Abul Hasan, Jahurul Islam, Shafiul IslamWest Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Kieran Powell, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Smith, Kieron Pollard, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Veerasammy Permaul, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Jason Holder, Andre Russell, Lendl SimmonsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
