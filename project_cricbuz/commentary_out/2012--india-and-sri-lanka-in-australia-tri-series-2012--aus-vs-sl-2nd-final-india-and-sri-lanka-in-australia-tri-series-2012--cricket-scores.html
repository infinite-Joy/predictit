Mahela Jayawardene is on strike. Brett Lee will open the attackThe players are walking back onto the field. Dilshan and Mahela were playing gorgeous flicks the other day in Brisbane. The same shot will fetch them sixers in Adelaide. It will be a stiff chase. Stay with us to find out.A tale of two centuries. One was a responsible one from David Warner while Clarke provided the fireworks. 271 should be a decent score to defend on a slow and sluggish pitch, the ball is keeping low ocassionally and the spinners will get some purchase off the track. SL were abysmal in the field with numerous fumbles and as many as 4 dropped chances. Clarke looked to be in severe pain towards the end of his innings and might not be able to field. Mahela had a run-in with the umpires and looked quite grumpy out there as his soldiers struggled on the field. He will have the task of keeping his team alive in the finals. Join us at 18:05 local time (13:05 IST) for the resumption.4

In fact, Mahela has pulled up a surprise. Dilshan will start off proceedings.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Matthew Wade(w), Shane Watson, Michael Clarke(c), Michael Hussey, David Hussey, Daniel Christian, Brett Lee, James Pattinson, Clint McKay, Xavier DohertySri Lanka (Playing XI): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Upul Tharanga, Chamara Kapugedera, Farveez Maharoof, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Rangana HerathMahela: I would have bowled first and I back the team to chase it down. It is a fresh wicket and we have gone in with an extra batsman today to chase. The Melbourne chase took a lot out of the boys and we did not execute the plans at Brisbane. Kapugedera replaces Dhammika Prasad.Michael Clarke: I had a horrible tour in South Africa where I did not win a single toss. David Warner is 100% fine and he will open the batting. McKay replaces Hilfenhaus. I am excited about the final.Australia have won the toss and elected to batIn the last five ODIs played by Australia at the Adelaide Oval, they have won three and lost two.Pitch Report: It is a typical Adelaide wicket but it is drier. Wasim Akram reckons that if there is no dew in the night, the spinners will get some grip. It is still an excellent wicket to bat on.Sri Lanka will hope that Angelo Mathews is fit today for this all-important match. He missed out on the first final due to injury.Will David Warner play today? He was in doubt for this match due to a groin injury that he sustained during his mammoth knock of 163 in the first final. We are awaiting official confirmation.Contests between Australia and Sri Lanka have been rivetting throughout the summer. Australia emerged victorious in their first encounter at Perth, following which Sri Lanka won three matches on the trot against them. The first final saw a brilliant fightback by the Sri Lankan tail and they came close to victory. Will this final be any different? Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Welcome to the 2nd final of the CB series between Australia and Sri Lanka. After the thriller at Brisbane, the action shifts to Adelaide where conditions are expected to suit the Sri Lankans. Australia will look to win today to end their summer on a high.Preview by PradeepThe long Australian summer is coming towards a close and the 2nd final between the hosts and Sri Lanka might well draw the curtains on a demanding as well at the same time a profitable summer for the hosts. They started the summer in an uncertain mood but will end with major gains accrued in all the departments of the game. They have some unfinished business though, a win over Sri Lanka at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday which will help them wrap up the finals will be the perfect icing on the cake.It is a task that is by no means a simple one. Sri Lanka have fought doggedly after a slow start to the tournament. Their fighting skills were well documented at Brisbane when the lower middle order manufactured a thrilling finale when all looked lost for their team. This is the same spirit that had seen Sri Lanka upstage Australia thrice in the league stages and Mahela Jayawardene will have to summon all his captaincy skills to take the finals to the deciding match.Australia:It was a David Warner show all along at the Gabba as the hosts piled up the highest score of the tournament. It was a surprise that Warner took so long to prove himself in a format that should come easy to him. His technique and the ability to maneuver the field placements must have gladdened the team management who have stood by him despite unconvincing performances in the tournament. On the flip side, Warner is down with a groin injury sustained during his innings of 163 and did not come out to field. He is not yet 100% sure of making it to the XI at Adelaide with the team management waiting on a fitness test. Matthew Wade was the aggressor at the top while the rest of the order made handy contributions. The batting unit looks settled as the hosts look to seal the series at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.Coming to the bowling department, Michael Clarke conceded that they needed to work hard at the nets after coming nearly unstuck during the latter half of the Sri Lankan chase. Brett Lee made a fine return after being rested in the final league match at the MCG. Xavier Doherty has impressed with his ability to keep things quiet in the middle overs while the likes of Shane Watson, Daniel Christian and David Hussey have chipped in with important wickets. The two stars of the Test series against India, James Pattinson and Ben Hilfenhaus were surprisingly off-color at the Gabba and need to get back to their regular ways.Sri Lanka:The after effect of the heroics at the MCG were clearly visible during the 1st final at the Gabba. Sri Lanka failed to sustain the momentum and only a late batting resurgence led by Nuwan Kulasekara saved them the ignominy of a complete humiliation. That late surge would have given positive vibes to a batting unit that has performed exceedingly well in the tournament so far. The conditions at the Adelaide Oval with its slow and low tracks should be ideally suited to the likings of the visitors. Mahela Jayawardena and Tillakaratne Dilshan have prospered as a pair while the middle order is in the safe hands of Kumar Sangakkara and Dinesh Chandimal.The bowling unit has been workmanlike. Lasith Malinga has blown hot and cold right throughout the tournament while Nuwan Kulasekara has been arguably the best pacer. The supporting acts of Ferveez Maharoof and Dhammika Prasad went for runs at the Gabba as Sri Lanka failed to rein in David Warner. Rangana Herath has done a creditable job with the ball although Sri Lanka would hope for better returns in the wicket column.Team News:Australia are sweating on the fitness of David Warner. Peter Forrest will take his place in the event of him being ruled out with Shane Watson opening with Matthew Wade. Ben Hilfenhaus and James Pattinson had a tough night at the Gabba and one of them might give way to the returning Clint McKaySri Lanka will hope for the return of their talismanic all-rounder, Angelo Matthews. Upul Tharanga did well in an unaccustomed batting position and Lahiru Thirimanne might be the man to miss out if Matthews returns. On a pitch that might favour spin, Sri Lanka might be tempted to play Sachitra Senanayake as the second spinner which will mean Dhammika Prasad returning to the sidelines.
