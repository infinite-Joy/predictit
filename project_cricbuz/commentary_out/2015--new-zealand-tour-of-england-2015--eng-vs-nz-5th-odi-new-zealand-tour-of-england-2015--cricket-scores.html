England's revised target will be 192 in 26 overs.16:54 Local Time, 15:54 GMT, 21:24 IST: It has stopped raining and it looks much brighter as well. We should have a restart for sure this time. In fact the sun it out, which is great to hear. Umpires are having an inspection.16:42 Local Time, 15:42 GMT, 21:12 IST: Oh no! Not great news, the drizzle is back. The covers are back on. It doesn't look threatening though.16:25 Local Time, 15:25 GMT, 20:55 IST: Great news folks! The rain has stopped and the covers are coming off. I assume that, if it starts in about 20 minutes, we will have 35 overs.16:20 Local Time, 15:20 GMT, 20:50 IST: Looks like the rain has eased a bit. The sky is also said to be a slightly brighter. So that's great news.16:10 Local Time, 15:10 GMT, 20:40 IST: As we wait for the rain to clear, let's take a look at England's likely targets by D/L method: 159 in 20 overs, 186 in 25 overs, 211 in 30 overs, 232 in 35 overs, 251 in 40 overs. Looks like we will lose at least lose 10 overs even if it stops raining now.Meanwhile, former England cricketer Graeme Swann has tweeted this. "The rain at Durham seems well set in. Hope it doesn't wash out the game, this series has been too good to finish with a damp squib." Fingers crossed folks!15:46 Local Time, 14:46 GMT, 20:16 IST: Oh dear!

However, it is not heavy and should clear shortly.15:06 Local Time, 14:06 GMT, 19:36 IST: Good news is that the drizzle has stopped and the covers are coming off. The chase will start in another 15 minutes.14:58 Local Time, 13:58 GMT, 19:28 IST: Unfortunately, due to a drizzle, England's innings won't start on time. The groundstaff have covered the ground with covers. The rain isn't heavy though.Wheeler though, played a handy innings to lift the sagging spirits in the camp. In the final over of the innings, he thumped Finn for two sixes and a boundary. The track is offering enough help for the pacers and it isn't exactly coming onto the bat. So, it can turn out to be a tricky chase. However, if the batsmen play with a calm head on their shoulders, the hosts have a good chance of usurping New Zealand for a series win.England's pacers put up a disciplined effort, but some late order hitting by Ben Wheeler took the visitors to a good total. The likes of Steven Finn, Ben Stokes and David Willey found enough movement in the air and off the track to keep the opposition ranks on their toes. Adil Rashid, the leg-spinner, too made his presence felt by prising out a couple of batsmen. The trio of Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor essayed handy knocks, but couldn't convert it into a big score. Grant Elliott, who has chipped in with timely knocks in the recent past, also lost his wicket at a crucial juncture of the innings.4
NEW ZEALAND:49.6 Finn to Ben Wheeler, SIX, Wheeler signs off in style. This is an excellent innings and will lift the mood in the dressing room.

The visitors have managed to score 32 runs off the last two overs

It's a bit overcast as well. We wanted to bowl first, but now we'll try and put the runs on the board. Both teams have played an exciting brand of cricket. One change, McClenaghan sits out and comes Mathieson in."Morgan: "We will bowl first. The whole morning feels a bowl-first morning. Things have gone very well for us. We are in a fantastic position today. Buttler misses out, Bairstow comes in and takes the gloves."England have won the toss and have opted to fieldJos Buttler, who split his webbing on the left hand during practice, has been ruled out of the game. This is a big blow for the hosts as Buttler was in fine form. He was playing a crucial role lower down the order as well. It is expected that Jonny Bairstow, who was added to the squad after Buttler's injury, will take his place.Meanwhile, speaking ahead of the match, this is what New Zealand coach Mike Hesson had to say, "It's been a very entertaining four matches. Obviously, getting down to Durham should be a fantastic finale." Well, it certainly is going to be a fantastic finale. Let's hope that the weather doesn't play spoilsport. It was a bit gloomy earlier at the ground. Fingers crossed! Toss and more updates in a short while...All of a sudden, Eoin Morgan's side was termed "New England." Indeed they played some terrific cricket in the 4th ODI. Despite chasing 350, they played no-fear cricket and in fact won the game with as many as 36 balls to spare. Skipper Eoin Morgan and Joe Root led from the front with hundreds, while Alex Hales scored a breezy fifty and gave England a great start alongside Jason Roy. Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor have been the star performers with the bat for New Zealand throughout the series and the visitors would hope that they would continue their good form here as well. Before it all began, many believed that New Zealand would be a tough ask for England, especially with the way they played in the World Cup. England themselves had a poor run in cricket's biggest tournament and there were a few off-field issues that needed to be addressed as well. However, the home side have surprised everyone and much to the delight of their fans, they have played an aggressive brand of cricket.A score of 300 has been achieved in 7 out of 8 innings in the series so far. Judging the way both teams have gone about their business, we are in for another cracking encounter. Hello and welcome to the final ODI of the 5-match series between England and New Zealand. It's the decider today. The winner of today's game will win the series, which is currently level at 2-2.Preview by Kaushik RangarajanThe England-New Zealand 'batathon' shifts to Chester-le-Street for the decider. Interestingly, it was here, the famous commemorative ballad of Durham Cricket, synonymous now with the current state of England cricket, was coined.Durham City has been dull so long,No bustle at all to show;But now the rage of all the throng,Is at cricketing to go.After four matches of teams breaching the 300-run mark with remarkable ease, the "New" England side head to Durham, on the back of a record chase with a chance to win their first ODI series on home soil since 2012. Not too long ago, New Zealand played a five-match series as evenly contested as this, against Pakistan in the UAE, and will want to draw from their experiences of that win to exorcise the ghosts of their stumble in the World Cup final.As the British media has called it, Eoin Morgan has ushered in a new brand of fearless ODI cricket. The days of the wait-and-watch approach behind them, England's batsman have been refreshingly adventurous even at risk of a premature collapse. The attitude, backed by a captain walking the talk in impressive fashion- three fifties and a hundred in four innings - holds England in good stead heading into the decider. The result in the final ODI notwithstanding, Eoin Morgan has foundations in place to build a strong ODI side.Brendon McCullum, meanwhile, has acknowledged that the England are a far-cry from the side that Tim Southee ran through in Wellington during the World Cup. The bowling, in the absence of Trent Boult and Corey Anderson, has struggled. That, however, is true for both sets of bowlers. New Zealand will want to reinforce their standing as a top ODI team and a series win in England will go a long way to ascertain that.Date: 20th June 2015Venue: Riverside Ground, Chester-le-StreetWeather: Mostly Cloudy, a high of 20 degree Celsius and 40% chance of rain.Team News:England:England called up the Overton twins for the injured Chris Jordan and Liam Plunkett ahead of the fourth ODI but Eoin Morgan insisted he was not in favour of tinkering with a settled side. After their record chase in Nottingham, it is unlikely England will ring in changes. However, if England need to bring one of the siblings into the eleven, Sam Billings' spot at No.7 appears the only viable option for change. With Buttler injured due to a split webbing, England have called up Jonny Bairstow as well. One of those two look likely to come in.Probable XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler/Sam Billings/Jonny Bairstow (wk), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Mark Wood, Steven FinnNew Zealand:Amidst the run-fest, Black Caps skipper Brendon McCullum has only 95 runs from four innings having faced only 66 deliveries. New Zealand will want their influential skipper to fire away at the top of the order to put early pressure on their opponents. The team would be particularly impressed by Mitchell Santner's quickfire 44 in the last game. His batting will add an extra dimension to the New Zealand line-up missing all-rounders in the middle-order. The think-tank could considering bringing in Nathan McCullum for his off-spinning abilities for the struggling Mitchell McClenaghan but will run the risk of missing an extra seamer under what is expected to be overcast conditions in Durham.Probable XI: Brendon McCullum (c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Luke Ronchi (wk), Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ben Wheeler, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan/Nathan McCullum.Stats and Trivia:- England have scored over 300 in each innings of the series and only Jason Roy (95.55) has a strike-rate under 100 in their top-7- Enroute his 322 runs in 4 innings, Eoin Morgan has hit 16 sixes.Quotes:"We've played in many series where the same rules have applied and it's been 200 plays 201."- New Zealand coach Mike Hesson on if the new rules contributed to such a high-scoring series."It's great that four games in a row now, win or lose, we've played with a positive attitude."- Steven Finn on the team's transformation after the World Cup debacle.Teams:New Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Ben Wheeler, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan, Colin Munro, Tom LathamEngland (From): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Mark Wood, Steven Finn, Craig Overton, Jamie Overton, James TaylorLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
