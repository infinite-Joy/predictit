Panyangara will open the attackWelcome back.. Sarfaraz Ahmed is opening with Azhar Ali. Hafeez sprained his leg while attempting to catch a six off Sikandar Raza..Yasir Shah was the pick of the Pakistani bowlers. He picked up two wickets and conceded only 40 runs in his 10 overs. Riaz was a bit wayward at the start of the innings, but came back well at the end. The Pakistani batsmen have a task on their hands. It is a good batting surface and they should fancy their chances of winning the series today. Join us back in a short while for the run-chase.....Zimbabwe's innings was a tale of two knocks. First, Chibhabha batted freely and scored a well composed 99. He was very unlucky not to have scored a maiden hundred. Even though Sibanda was not fluent, Chibhabha kept going at the other end. The vistiors lost few quick wickets at the middle stage and that is when Raza came to the crease. He took his time to get going, but once he did, he carted the bowlers all round the park. At the start of the last over, he was on 96 and he managed to reach the landmark unlike Chibhabha. It was his second ODI ton and it has helped Zimbabwe post a decent total.4

We wanted to bowl in dry conditions. Same team'Pitch Report: 'Another track that should help the batsmen. Win the toss and bat first, nothing in it for the bowlers,' reckons Rameez RajaPakistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldThere's some injury news from the Zimbabwe camp. Craig Ervine has been ruled out of the remainder of the series with a hamstring injury. The visitors suffered a further blow with skipper Chigumbura dealt a two-match ban for slow overate in the first match. Charles Coventry is expected to feature today as the hosts look to make a comeback into the series.It was a comprehensive victory for the hosts in the first ODI on Tuesday. Batting first, they piled up a massive 375 on the board. Shoaib Malik made a hundred on his ODI comeback, Azhar Ali continued his rich vein of form while there were fifties for Mohammad Hafeez and Haris Sohail as well. Zimbabwe's reply was spirited with Elton Chigumbura smacking a fine 117, his maiden ODI hundred. Hamilton Masakadza chipped in with a run-a-ball 73 but the visitors still fell short by 41 runs, despite making their highest ever score in an ODI against a Test playing nation. Can the visitors do better today? Hello and a warm welcome to the second ODI between Pakistan and Zimbabwe.Preview by Siddharth VishwanathanPakistan carried the momentum of their T20I success into the first ODI and their batsmen put on a magnificent show. For the first time, Pakistan's top four went past fifty, with Shoaib Malik leading the way with a brilliant 76-ball 112 as they notched up 375 for 3. However, their smiles would have been tempered with the way Zimbabwe responded with the bat, finishing on 334 for 5 and losing by a margin of 41 runs.Zimbabwe's fight showed their determination but it also exposed the problems that Pakistan's bowling department faces. The likes of Anwar Ali and Mohammad Sami were dispatched to all parts of the Gaddafi stadium and it needed the experience of Wahab Riaz, who finished with figures of 3 for 47, to help the hosts avoid a major embarrassment.Heading into the match, Zimbabwe have suffered a big jolt while Pakistan will be aiming for a polished performance to clinch the series.Venue: Gaddafi stadium, LahoreStarts: 16:00 localWeather: Clear skies with a high of 42 degreesTeam newsPakistanThe bowling was below-par in the first ODI and they may be tempted to bolster their experience in the bowling. Anwar Ali, who had figures of 10-0-81-1, might be replaced by Junaid Khan while Sami, who was making a comeback after three years, might be given another chance after a poor first match.Probable XI1 Mohammad Hafeez, 2 Azhar Ali (c), 3 Shoaib Malik, 4 Haris Sohail, 5 Sarfraz Ahmed, 6 Asad Shafiq, 7 Hammad Azam, 8 Wahab Riaz, 9 Yasir Shah, 10 Anwar Ali/Junaid Khan, 11 Mohammad SamiZimbabweHeading into this match, they have suffered a major blow. Elton Chigumbura, who blasted 117 off 95 balls, has been suspended for the remaining two ODIs due to a slow over-rate offence. His absence will throw the team composition in disarray and it will be interesting to see how who will captain the side in his absence. Chigumbura's absence could see Roy Kaia, the 23-year-old Mountaineers allrounder, making his debut on Thursday.Probable XI1 Vusi Sibanda, 2 Sikandar Raza, 3 Hamilton Masakadza, 4 Roy Kaia, 5 Sean Williams, 6 Craig Ervine, 7 Richmond Mutumbami, 8 Prosper Utseya, 9 Tinashe Panyangara, 10 Chris Mpofu, 11 Brian VitoriTeams:Zimbabwe (From): Vusi Sibanda, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura, Craig Ervine, Richmond Mutumbami, Prosper Utseya, Brian Vitori, Chris Mpofu, Tinashe Panyangara, Chamu Chibhabha, Charles Coventry, Graeme Cremer, Roy Kaia, Tawanda MupariwaPakistan (From): Azhar Ali, Mohammad Hafeez, Haris Sohail, Shoaib Malik, Asad Shafiq, Sarfraz Ahmed, Hammad Azam, Wahab Riaz, Anwar Ali, Mohammad Sami, Yasir Shah, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Rizwan, Babar Azam, Junaid Khan, Ahmed ShehzadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
