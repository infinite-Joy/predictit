AFGHANISTAN:19.5 19.5Rohan Mustafa to Amir Hamza, out Stumped!! That's that. UAE win by 16 runs to set the ball rolling in these qualifiers. Mustafa bags his third to finish the rituals by luring Hamza out of the crease. A little bit of turn is enough to go past the outside edge of his wafting willow and Swapnil Patil does the rest. Amir Hamza st Swapnil Patil b Rohan Mustafa 4(2) [4s-1]Rohan Mustafa to Amir Hamza, THAT'S OUT!! Stumped!!
AFGHANISTAN:19.4 Rohan Mustafa to Amir Hamza, FOUR, another biiiig swing which catches a thick outside edge and runs away fineAmir Hamza, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AFGHANISTAN:19.3 Rohan Mustafa to Shapoor, out Bowled!! Mustafa is helping himself to some easy wickets to add to an already impressive match CV. Teases this up to entice Shapoor into a massive slog, he can't quite reach the pitch and is castled. Shapoor b Rohan Mustafa 0(1)Rohan Mustafa to Shapoor, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Shapoor Zadran, left handed bat, comes to the crease
AFGHANISTAN:19.2 Rohan Mustafa to Dawlat Zadran, out Bowled!! Got him! Full ball on middle, takes a bit of the pad before going on to knock the timber.

AFGHANISTAN:18.1 Naveed to Sadiq, out Bowled!! Here comes the death knell, surely. If one man was going to do it for Afghanistan today, it had to be Sadiq. And now his stumps are lying everywhere. Engages himself in an ugly slog and fails to get bat on ball. All in the dust. Sadiq b Naveed 72(48) [4s-8 6s-1]Naveed to Sadiq, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Mohammad Naveed [3.0-0-18-1] is back into the attackDawlat Zadran, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AFGHANISTAN:17.6 Rohan Mustafa to Najibullah, out Najibullah Run Out!! Where was Najibullah going? I can't see the point of trying a deadly single off the last ball when you want Sadiq to take most of the strike. Comes across as a silly error in judgement coming through due to a lack of situational awareness. Sadiq did the right thing by sending him back. But by then, disaster had struck. Najibullah run out (Swapnil Patil) 21(14) [6s-1]Rohan Mustafa to Najibullah, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!

Sadiq rocks back and slaps it hard through mid-wicketMohammad Shahzad [1.0-0-8-0] is back into the attackWith 68 required from the last 5, seems like Afghanistan have left themselves with too much to do

AFGHANISTAN:14.5 Ahmed Raza to Najibullah, 1 run, pushed through the covers

AFGHANISTAN:2.2 Naveed to Usman Ghani, out Caught by Rohan Mustafa!! Oh another. UAE are right on top here. Both openers sent back to the hutch with not many on the board. Another hugely extravagant stroke. On a good length and Ghani tries to slog it out in the car park somewhere, but he's through with it too early. The thick leading edge lobs up and is calmly pouched by Mustafa. Usman Ghani c Rohan Mustafa b Naveed 3(6)Naveed to Usman Ghani, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

Unleashes a sumptuous drive through the covers to set the scoring registers ringingMohammad Shahzad and Usman Ghani are at the crease. Mohammad Shahzad is on strike. Naveed will open the attackA commendable effort from the UAE batsmen, led by Rohan Mustafa at the top of the order. He timed the ball really well right from the get-go and some of his strokeplay was breathtaking. Got UAE off to a flier before racing to his half-century. Although Afghanistan pulled things back post his departure, they have a quite a task set in front of them. Add to it the fact that they are earmarked as favourites in the qualifiers. Pressure is on.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:5.6 Nabi to Muhammad Kaleem, SIX, brutally slogged over mid-wicket. Too full this time meaning that Kaleem doesn't really run the risk of hitting against the line as he is right to the pitch
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:5.5 Nabi to Muhammad Kaleem, 2 runs, Nabi resorts to bowling darts on the pads, and Kaleem picks him away behind square. Good chase in the deep prevents a boundary

Four teams will vie with each other during the qualifiers - the topper progressing to the main stage - also involving India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. On form, Afghanistan should go through, but T20Is are rarely based on form and more on performance in each game. Can UAE, Oman and Hong Kong prove their worth? We have a double-header today, with Afghanistan taking on UAE in the first match followed by Hong Kong against Oman. Toss for the first match in a while..Preview:Afghanistan are set to take on the United Arab Emirates in the opening encounter of the Asia Cup 2016 qualifiers at the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in Fatullah on Friday (February 19).The two sides will kick-start the campaign in which four teams - Oman and Hong Kong, apart from UAE and Afghanistan, will play one match each against the other. The team with most points at the end of three matches each will qualify through to the main tournament. In case of a tie in points, the team with the best Net Run Rate (NRR) will go through.Afghanistan, led by Asghar Stanikzai, come into the tournament on the back of a successful Twenty20 International and One-Day International (ODI) series against Zimbabwe and are the favourites to go through.Despite the change in leadership, from Mohammad Nabi to Stanikzai, they have an experienced bunch of players, who have played together for a long time and took Afghanistan cricket from obscurity to becoming a coherent unit.Shapoor Zadran and Dawlat Zadran have the experience and pace to trouble the best of sides in the world. Nabi and Samiullah Shenwari offer balance with their dual role. Even in the batting department, which has been their weakness, they have a decent mix of steady and power-hitters. The overall composition of the side, on paper, makes them one of the strongest associate nations in cricket.UAE, on the other hand, are one of the weakest. They have played just one T20I against Afghanistan and were comprehensively outplayed. Their bowling and batting is quite ordinary and will require a massive team effort to outperform Afghanistan.Teams:United Arab Emirates (From): Mohammad Shahzad, Muhammad Kaleem, Shaiman Anwar, Swapnil Patil(w), Rohan Mustafa, Ahmed Raza(c), Amjad Javed, Mohammad Naveed, Qadeer Ahmed, Mohammad Usman, Zaheer Maqsood, Farhan Ahmed, Saqlain Haider, Usman Mushtaq, Fahad TariqAfghanistan (From): Mohammad Shahzad(w), Noor Ali Zadran, Asghar Stanikzai(c), Mohammad Nabi, Mirwais Ashraf, Najibullah Zadran, Rashid Khan, Gulbadin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Shapoor Zadran, Amir Hamza, Karim Sadiq, Yamin Ahmadzai, Rokhan Barakzai, Shafiqullah Shafiq, Usman Ghani, Fareed Ahmad, Najeeb TarakaiLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
