It is a normal Sharjah pitch and should be good for batting'Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith MalingaPakistan (Playing XI): Sharjeel Khan, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sohaib Maqsood, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Shahid Afridi, Umar Akmal(w), Bilawal Bhatti, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid KhanSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldHello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the third ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. On flat surfaces, both set of batsmen have made merry. There has been very little to cheer for the bowlers though, and as the series moves back to Sharjah, conditions will not be any better for them. Sri Lanka, with their powerful batting line-up have been happy to chase down targets while Misbah was unhappy with the death bowling abilities of his bowlers. Will things change today? Toss and team updates in 15 minutes..Preview by Gokul GopalThe bowlers from both sides will be hoping for some respite when Pakistan and Sri Lanka face off in the third ODI in Sharjah. The first two ODIs were both high-scoring affairs with the hosts drawing first blood before the Lankans managed to square the series. Another batting feast is on the cards and both teams will be looking to out-bat the other and take a 2-1 lead in the 5-match series.Pakistan: Most of the Pakistani batsmen have found form in the first two matches. Mohammad Hafeez and Ahmed Shehzad have notched up three-figure scores while Sharjeel Khan, Sohaib Maqsood and Misbah-ul-Haq have registered well-compiled fifties in the series so far. Shahid Afridi's form with the bat has been good too as the all-rounder has scored a couple of useful quick-fire 30s, batting in the death. Umar Akmal is the only batsman who has not spent time in the middle and Pakistan will be hoping that he will be ready if an opportunity arises for him. Misbah will also be eager for the in-form batsmen to extend their good form and put the Lankans under pressure.Amongst the bowlers, Junaid Khan has been Pakistan's top wicket-taker in this series, picking up a couple of three-wicket hauls. While he was expensive in the first game, he bowled a lot more economically in the second match. The quick bowlers have been the ones to concede the most in the two games so far as Sohail Tanvir went in excess of 6 an over again while Bilawal Bhatti, after giving away 8 an over in the first match, gave close to six in the game at Dubai, despite bowling a couple of maiden overs. Saeed Ajmal and Hafeez have been keeping it tight while Afridi, after a good showing with the ball in the first ODI, went for a few in the last game. Misbah will be hoping that the bowlers stick to good lines and keep the Lankan batsmen in check.Sri Lanka: The visitors have been involved in a two closely-contested matches and they should thank the lower-middle order for keeping the fight on. Kusal Perera (64 in the first match) and Kumar Sangakkara (58 in the second match) are the only ones to score in excess of 50 while the rest of the batters have failed to convert their starts. Seekkuge Prasanna and Sachitra Senanayake were the ones to run Pakistan close in the first match while the efforts of Angelo Mathews and Nuwan Kulasekara helped the visiting team past the line in the 2nd ODI. The Lankans will be hoping for more substantial contributions from the top order as they look to take a lead in the series.The Lankan spinners Prasanna and Senanayake have done a tidy job so far in the series while the seamers have been leaking runs. Lasith Malinga has had a poor couple of games while Thisara Perera has also turned out to be expensive. Suranga Lakmal, who gave away quite a few in the first match, made way for Kulasekara but the change did not make much of a difference as far as bowling is concerned as the latter also went close to 6 an over. Skipper Mathews, who has also been inconsistent with the ball, will be hoping that he and the rest of the bowlers can do a better job in the upcoming games.Team News: Umar Gul returns to the Pakistan squad after a nine-month injury lay-off. With Misbah complaining about the lack of experience among his bowlers following the loss in the 2nd ODI, the experienced pacer is likely to be drafted into the eleven, probably at the expense of Bhatti or Tanvir. For Sri Lanka, Lahiru Thirimanne, who sprained his right ankle before the 2nd ODI, is unlikely to play the third game. Dimuth Karunaratne, who replaced him for the match in Dubai, is likely to hold on to his place.Quotes:Death bowling is an issue for us, we need to address that if we want to win the series: Misbah-ul-Haq.With Pakistan you have to fight all the time and need to be positive: Angelo Mathews.Teams:Pakistan (From): Sharjeel Khan, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sohaib Maqsood, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Shahid Afridi, Umar Akmal(w), Bilawal Bhatti, Sohail Tanvir, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Anwar Ali, Haris Sohail, Abdur Rehman, Asad ShafiqSri Lanka (From): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith Malinga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kithuruwan Vithanage, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Ashan PriyanjanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
