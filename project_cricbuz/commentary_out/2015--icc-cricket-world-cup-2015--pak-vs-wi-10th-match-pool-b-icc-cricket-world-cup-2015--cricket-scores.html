Jamshed is on strike. Jerome Taylor will open the attackTaylor comes round the wicket straightaway, he has two slips in place..Welcome back.. The Pakistani openers stride out to the middle. A lot depends on Shehzad. He got off to a start against India, but couldn't continue. Jamshed, who was injured and was out of the field for most of the West Indies innings will be partnering Shehzad. The countdown is done. Here we go with the first ball...Pakistan have not been the best of chasers. They will need a good start, if they have to make a match of it. With the bowling attack West Indies possess, they should fancy their chances. Who will come out on top? We'll find out in a short while...Pakistan fielding once again came under the scanner. They dropped a catch as early as the fifth over. Nasir Jamshed injured his finger while trying to hold onto to a Smith offering. Afridi, then spilled two catches, one of Samuels and the other of Bravo. Irfan then grassed Simmons towards the end. These are the ones that were at the top of my head. There was plenty of sloppy work in the field. The bowling was disciplined in the first half and they lost it when the batsmen started to have a go at them.Ramdin continued batting in a positive manner and brought up his fifty, but got out soon after. Sammy was little shaky to start off with, he soon found his element and scored a 28-ball 30. Meanwhile, Simmons kept the scoreboard ticking and he along with Russell smashed 79 runs in the last 5 overs. The Jamaican all-rounder was clean in his striking as he scored a quickfire 42.It has been yet another fabulous recovery from the West Indies batsmen. They were reduced to 29/2 with Smith and Gayle going cheaply. But, the rest of the batsmen stepped up and chipped in to post their second consecutive 300-plus score. Samuels and Bravo steadied the innings after the early loss. The pair added 75 runs before the former threw his wicket away. Ramdin came in and provided the much needed impetus to the innings and just when they took the batting powerplay, Bravo pulled his hamstring and was taken off the field.4

Close call that for Dwayne Smith, but he won't mind itDwayne Smith and Gayle are at the crease. Dwayne Smith is on strike. Irfan will open the attackThe countdown starts and it is the big man - Irfan with the new ball. Here we go then!Lots of Pakistani players have their hands on their chest as their national anthem is being played. After the anthems are finished, the Pakistani team are in a huddle. Misbah and Afridi have a chat as they walk out. Gayle and Smith are there too. Suddenly, the sun is out and we should be set for a good game (hopefully!) of cricket.Our man, Jamie says it has gotten a bit overcast. The flags are fluttering as the players and the officials walk out for the national anthems. A healthy crowd in with lots of Pakistanis seen wearing green. Holder and Misbah walk out with little kids accompanying them. Rally round the West Indies is up first. What a beauty that is. After it is done, a couple of the players clap.Pitch report by Scott Styris and Wasim Akram: Lot of grass but dead grass. The grass is there to hold the pitch together. It's a good wicket and often captains winning the toss can make the mistake of bowling on this. 'We think it's going to be good, but we are a little bit unsure too' signs off Styris.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Dwayne Smith, Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Lendl Simmons, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Sulieman BennPakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Haris Sohail, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Sohail Khan, Mohammad IrfanPakistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldHolder: "We have put it behind us. It is a very important game we have against Pakistan and our focus is pretty much here, starting this game well and finishing it well. The big thing for us is to assess the conditions as quickly as possible. Sulieman Benn comes in place of Kemar Roach, he is fit today and we have him."Misbah: "Yeah, of course and its an important game for both teams because we have lost the first game. If you need to really proceed well and in this World Cup, its an important game for both teams. We need to show some responsibility because if you look at this World Cup, 300 is a par score and batting needs to be more responsible and give a good total to the bowling. I would want to bowl first. It looks a little bit slow. The grass could make a difference, it feels a little bit damp, so we just want to utilise that, little bit moisture. We have only one change, Nasir Jamshed back for Yasir Shah."Jason Holder: 'Captaincy isn't a burden on me. Not got a wicket here but hopefully that'll change'Misbah: 'Two games ago, Maqsood did well. Its 1 unfortunate game (v India) for him, Umar & Haris. Im confident the guys will do well'Some quotes from both the captains in the pre-match press conference..Jamie is at the ground and he has tweeted, "Chris Gayle having a hit at Hagley Oval before the big game"Well, that concludes this segment. We are gearing up towards the game and have just got started. Stay tuned as the toss and teams are not far away.Head-to-head: These two sides have played quite a few times against each other when it comes to the World Cup. The men from the Caribbean have the upper hand, with 6 wins in 9 matches. In their last meeting in 2011, Pakistan spinners bamboozled the West Indies' batsmen with the turn and variations. And going by their previous game against Ireland, where George Dockrell, Andy McBrine and Paul Stirling bowled pretty well, Pakistan might not make any changes to their bowling attack. They will be playing all three spinners in, Afridi, Yasir Shah and Haris Sohail.West IndiesJason Holder has emphasized that the seniors players have to make a telling contribution. The likes of Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith and Marlon Samuels have failed to get going with the bat. If they have to put up some sort of a fight in the coming matches, they would want those three to perform to their best of abilities. Sulieman Benn missed the first game with injury, but has been declared fit for this encounter. He might take Kemar Roach's place, who had a forgettable day against Ireland.West Indies have had a tough time in recent times. They are being led by an inexperienced captain, who still has not figured out, if has to concentrate on his bowling or his leadership skills. In their first game against Ireland, they were 87/5 after which Lendl Simmons and Darren Sammy rescued them and took the score past the 300-mark. The bowlers then let them down with their wayward line and lengths. None of them could keep a lid on scoring and Ireland cruised to victory with 25 balls to spare.PakistanThe batting entirely depends upon Misbah-ul-Haq. The ploy to promote Younis Khan to open the innings backfired. As the veteran managed only 6 runs. The middle-order of Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Akmal and Haris Sohail didn't show much application. Their skipper, Misbah was the lone warrior as he scored a valiant 76. Shahid Afridi showed some restraint, but the creeping run-rate had the better of him. A couple of changes might be in order, who will that be remains to be seen.Pakistan, came into the tournament on the back of a 2-0 series loss against New Zealand. Though they won both their practise games, their first match against India didn't go according to plan. They entered the contest having not won a single World Cup game versus their arch-rivals and ignominiously extended that scoreline to 0-6. They allowed India to score 300, it would have been more had not been for some tight death bowling. Thereafter, they kept losing wickets at regular intervals and finally were bowled out for 224.Before we go any further, let us have an overview as to how these two sides have performed recently, looking back at their respective opening games in this tournament.The 2015 World Cup has already seen some exciting moments. I hope everyone has recovered from yesterday's game. Termed as a tight encounter, the New Zealand-England game turned out to be a one-sided affair, that is putting it mildly. Tim Southee blew England away with a 7-fer and Brendon McCullum made light work of the target with a 25-ball 77. Coming to today's encounter, the two most unpredictable teams in the game - Pakistan and West Indies clash against each other.Preview:Two teams that need to win to stay alive in the 2015 ICC World Cup will meet at Hagley Oval on Saturday, but that is not the only similarity between them. Both are missing influential players, both are creaking from instability and both are coming off dramatic losses. Welcome then, to West Indies versus Pakistan in game ten of the tournament. Not an ordinary fixture by any regards.In one corner, the cornered tigers - Pakistan. Led by Misbah-ul-Haq, 40, and in his final World Cup. In the other - West Indies, led by Jason Holder, 23, in his first World Cup. Holder is only 27 ODIs old - having led in six - with questions being asked as to why he was saddled with the responsibility of leading an unstable side. Misbah is in New Zealand just months after his batting form and a series of losses prompted calls for his removal. Two men at opposite ends of their careers, but with the task of leading two of the most frustrating teams in world cricket.Pakistan occupy bottom place in Pool B, with West Indies on level higher owing to a better net run-rate. Both must win, and both captains had their own views on what it will take to outdo the other."To stop teams to under 300, you need to back your field placements and take wickets," said Misbah on Friday. "Defending 300 or hoping to keep teams to under 300, you must take wickets in the middle overs and up front. Regular breakthroughs are the key. If six or seven batsmen bat well, 300 can easily be made and chased. Our focus will be wickets."Considering West Indies' struggles against spin - the Irish trio of Andy McBrine (10-1-26-0), George Dockrell (10-0-50-3) and Paul Stirling (6-0-33-0) played important roles at Nelson - Misbah was asked if he would pack his side with another spinner, but his reply was a ready one: "We don't have four spinners. Let's see the final look of the pitch and decide."Two possible changes to Pakistan's XI could be shifting veteran Younis Khan, who was oddly promoted to open against India despite having not batted in that role since 2009, back to No 4 and playing Sarfraz Ahmed as wicketkeeper instead of Umar Akmal. Younis had only twice opened in and ODI in his 262-match career - in 2004 and 2009, making 0 and 4 - before the India opener where he made 6. But a closer inspection of his numbers since he was recalled to the team in late 2014 show the apart from one century against New Zealand in the UAE, he has scores of 4, 6, 35, 12, 9, 11 and 6. Not the kind of form to put forward when your place in the team is on the line, no matter your experience. Should Younis be dropped, it is foreseeable that Nasir Jamshed slots back into the team at the top.Asked about Younis and Umar Akmal's roles in the side, Misbah presented a straight bat. "You can't say after one game. We're not panicking. We're looking into all matters very closely and want to go with a composition that can win us the next game and all those to follow," he said.As far as West Indies are concerned, they will need to be far better in the field. To make 304 for 7 from the depths of 87 for 5 and then lose to Ireland with 25 deliveries left in the match would rankle, no doubt. They will hope that left-arm spinner Suleiman Benn is back to fitness - he bowled a fair deal during training yesterday and today - in order to attack a team that has its problems against spin. Benn looks good to return, meaning that Kemar Roach, who was expensive against Ireland, could miss out."Pakistan lost their first match against India, we've both started the campaign with a loss. It's important that we take this game very seriously, as we did in the first couple of games we had, said Holder. "Got to execute our plans. What is clear for us is that if we do that, and do what we want to, then we can be very successful. It's about being consistent.These two teams last met for ODIs in the Caribbean in July 2013, a series that Pakistan, under Misbah, won 3-1. Then, Misbah top-scored in the series with 260 runs at 65, with four fifties in five innings. An encore would put Pakistan in a good spot, with some help from his talented team-mates.Probable XIsWest Indies: 1 Dwayne Smith, 2 Chris Gayle, 3 Darren Bravo, 4 Marlon Samuels, 5 Denesh Ramdin (wk), 6 Lendl Simmons, 7 Daren Sammy, 8 Andre Russell, 9 Jason Holder, 10 Jerome Taylor, 11 Suleiman BennPakistan: 1 Ahmed Shehzad, 2 Nasir Jamshed, 3 Sohaib Maqsood, 4 Misbah-ul-Haq (capt), 5 Umar Akmal (wk), 6 Haris Sohail, 7 Shahid Afridi, 8 Wahab Riaz, 9 Yasir Shah, 10 Sohail Khan, 11 Mohammad IrfanTeams:West Indies (From): Dwayne Smith, Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Lendl Simmons, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Kemar Roach, Sulieman Benn, Jonathan Carter, Sheldon Cottrell, Nikita MillerPakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Younis Khan, Haris Sohail, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Sohail Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Nasir Jamshed, Rahat Ali, Ehsan Adil, Sarfraz AhmedLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
