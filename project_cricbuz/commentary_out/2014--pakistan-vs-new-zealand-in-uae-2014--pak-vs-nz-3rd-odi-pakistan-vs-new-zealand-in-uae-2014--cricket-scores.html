Matt Henry will open the attackHafeez and Shehzad are in the middle so are the New Zealand players. Henry will start the proceedings with two slips in place...Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Anton Devcich, Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Tom Latham, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), James Neesham, Nathan McCullum, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghanPakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Younis Khan, Haris Sohail, Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi(c), Wahab Riaz, Sohail Tanvir, Mohammad IrfanKane Williamson: 'Whatever you do, you have to do well. The pitch shouldn't change much from the last game. Adam Milne, Vettori and Brownlie are out. Guptill is fit and he comes back, Neesham and Nathan McCullum also come in.'Shahid Afridi: 'We will bat first. We know how good this pitch plays. The batsmen should take more repsonsibility after the last game. Misbah is inujured so Umar Akmal is playing this game.'Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: 'The weather is fine, it should be comfortable for the players. The Sharjah track hasn't changed over the years. It is dry and there is a sheen on this track. There is extra shine on this pitch. Sharjah has produced just 230-235 runs over the years. Because of the slowness of the track, it gets difficult for the batsman. There are a few cracks as well. Win the toss and bat first,' reckons Rameez RajaThe selectors have announced that Shahid Afridi will captain the side in Misbah's absence. Anwar Ali and Yasir Shah have also been roped into the squad. Pakistan are yet to find the right combination for the World Cup and there have been a few changes in the playing XI for almost every match. It was surprising to see Umar Akmal being left out for the first two ODIs. Will he get an opportunity today? We'll find out more at the toss in a short while...The series is nicely poised at 1-1, with three games to go. If Pakistan came from behind to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the first ODI, a spirited batting performance, led by captain Williamson, helped the Black Caps seal the second game. It is a big blow to Pakistan that their captain, Misbah-ul-Haq has been ruled out for the rest of the series, with a hamstring injury that he picked up while fielding in the second ODI. Umar Gul, who returned to international cricket just a few days ago, has picked an ankle injury and has been ignored for the last three ODIs.Preview by Kaushik RangarajanNew Zealand have never led in their tour of UAE this season. A recurring trend has been that of New Zealand coming back to level the series. It happened in the Tests, in the T2OIs and now in the ODIs. However, they now have the opportunity to get their noses ahead for the first time in the tour, in Sharjah, where they levelled the five-match series 1-1 on Friday. Pakistan, however would look to wrest the initiative back, after another top-order collapse gave them a sub-par score in the second one-dayer.Pakistan sans regular skipper Misbah-Ul-Haq (ruled out of the series due to a hamstring injury) will be lead by Shahid Afridi. Misbah's unavailability is expected to give Umar Akmal a place in the misfiring top order. Twice in two matches, they have been found wanting against a second string New Zealand bowling attack. Pakistan's bowling, however, has been handed a surprise boost by the performances of part-timer Haris Sohail. It remains to be seen if Yasir Shah and Anwar Ali (replacing the injured Umar Gul and Bilawal Bhatti) are directly drafted into the playing eleven.That New Zealand are bowling a second string attack and still troubling Pakistan on decent batting surfaces will give them enough reasons to be optimistic about the World Cup. Both, Matt Henry and Mitchell McClenaghan have hit the deck and extracted significant purchase. The Black Caps will however be wary of the middle-order collapse in the last ODI that threatened to undo the good work of the openers.Pitch and Conditions:The shiny surface at Sharjah has historically been a bat-first wicket despite offering true bounce to the quicks. However, if dew is expected in the evening, teams might still consider chasing, as in the last ODI.Statistics:Shahid Afridi has given away more runs than any other bowler in the history of One-Day International Cricket (13,138)Quotes:"Yasir Shah is a good prospect for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, so more exposure would do him a world of good"Pakistan's Chief Selector and Team Manager Moin Khan on the leggie's inclusion to Pakistan's squad.Teams:New Zealand (From): Dean Brownlie, Anton Devcich, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Tom Latham, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne, Mitchell McClenaghan, Matt Henry, Nathan McCullum, Martin Guptill, James NeeshamPakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Younis Khan, Haris Sohail, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Sohail Tanvir, Mohammad Irfan, Anwar Ali, Yasir Shah, Zulfiqar Babar, Nasir Jamshed, Umar AkmalLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
