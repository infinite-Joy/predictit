INDIA:30.2 Steyn to Harbhajan, out Caught by (sub)C Morris!! Harbhajan is reluctant to move. He can't believe that he hit this straight to the fielder. Finally, he makes his way back to the dressing room. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Harbhajan drives from the middle of the bat, but finds Morris at short cover. In fact, Morris just moved to his left to complete the catch. Harbhajan c (sub)C Morris b Steyn 0(4)Steyn to Harbhajan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

Rahane was the only Indian batsman who was looking very good and he's gone now. Shortish and on the leg stump, Rahane mistimes the pull, deep mid-wicket runs forward and completes a simple catch. End of a sensational innings from the local boy. He hardly played an ugly shot, yet managed a strike-rate of 150. So India have lost their last recognised pair now.

INDIA:24.5 Rabada to Raina, out Bowled!! This is really poor cricket from Raina and sensible stuff from young Rabada. Looks like Raina was only expecting the short deliveries from the South African pacers, but Rabada reminds him that he's a clever bowler and slips out a yorker to castle the left-hander. A 20-year-old has out-thought a 28-year-old here. That tells you the story. As always, Raina moves right across the stumps. The leg stump was exposed, Rabada targets the base of leg stump and nails the yorker to perfection. Raina tried to glance, but it was all too late. Raina b Rabada 12(13) [4s-1 6s-1]Rabada to Raina, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Rahane hasn't had strike for 10 balls now.
INDIA:24.4 Rabada to Raina, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Raina punches it off the back foot to point
INDIA:24.3 Rabada to Raina, no run, this is a terrific response from Rabada. Pacy bumper on the leg stump, Raina ducks under it at the last moment. He was totally beaten for pace on that occasion
INDIA:24.2 Rabada to Raina, FOUR, aah! This is a very good shot. Raina moved across the stumps, Rabada cramped him for room with this short of length delivery, but Raina somehow manages to play the pick-up shot and times it to perfection. The ball flies over mid-wicket
INDIA:24.1 Rabada to Raina, no run, Raina backs away, Rabada bowls a back of a length delivery outside off stump, left alone. Probably he could have slashed and got a boundaryA slip in place
INDIA:23.6 Tahir to Raina, 1 run, edgedddd but just over the man running back from backward point. Googly wide outside off stump, Raina goes for the drive over cover, the ball takes the thick edge and luckily for Raina, it clears the infield

INDIA:23.3 Tahir to Raina, no run, googly again from Tahir, Raina defends it into the on-side
INDIA:23.2 Tahir to Raina, SIX, the slog wasn't too far away with Raina on strike and with the asking rate mounting, he was obviously going to play the shot. Googly on the stumps, probably he picked it up early, went down on one knee and smashed it over deep mid-wicket
INDIA:23.1 Tahir to Raina, no run, flighted delivery just outside off stump, Raina drives it to the left of the bowler, who dives and stops the ball
INDIA:22.6 Rabada to Rahane, FOUR, cut away nicely and Abbott is too straight at sweeper cover. Short and asking for trouble, Rahane plays the cut over point, Abbott runs to his left but he had no chance

INDIA:22.3 Rabada to Dhawan, out Caught by Amla!! In the airrrrr and that's a terrific catch. Oh dear! Amla banged his head onto the ground after completing the catch and he's in a lot of pain. Hopefully, he's alright. Full and fast on the stumps, Dhawan goes early into the flick, gets a thick leading edge, Amla runs to his left from extra-cover, dives and takes a stunner with both hands. That ends a fine 112-run stand. Dhawan c Amla b Rabada 60(59) [4s-8]Rabada to Dhawan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:22.2 Rabada to Rahane, 1 run, good length delivery outside off stump, Rahane guides it to third man
INDIA:22.1 Rabada to Rahane, FOUR, oh no! Imran Tahir has let that go right through him atshort fine leg. Length delivery down the leg-side, Rahane helps it away fine, it should have been a dot ball, but Tahir fumbles as he doesn't bend down in timeKagiso Rabada [4.0-0-22-1] is back into the attackTahir has already gone for 37 runs in his 4 overs. Remember, South Africa have a problem with their 5th bowling option. AB de Villiers said at the toss that he will chip in if needed. Elgar and Behardien are expected to fill that slot. If Tahir doesn't deliver, it puts extra pressure on the Proteas. Let's see how it all works.
INDIA:21.6 Tahir to Rahane, 1 run, googly from Tahir, Rahane nudges it to mid-wicket
INDIA:21.5 Tahir to Rahane, SIX, in the airrrr and just over the leaping fielder at deep mid-wicket. Not from the middle of the bat, but Rahane and India will take it. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Rahane gets down on one knee and slog-sweeps it for a maximum
INDIA:21.4 Tahir to Rahane, no run, careful Rahane, careful. He was looking to come down the track again, but Tahir bowls this slightly outside off stump and forces the batsman to dig it out
INDIA:21.3 Tahir to Rahane, no run, sent back and Rahane escapes a run-out scare. Googly from Tahir, Rahane works it to mid-wicket, looks for a run and Dhawan sends him back just in time
INDIA:21.2 Tahir to Rahane, SIX, shottttt! Wow! That's gone all the way. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Rahane advances, gets to the pitch of the ball and lofts it back over Tahir's head. That brings up the 100 partnership as well
INDIA:21.1 Tahir to Dhawan, 1 run, googly outside off stump, Dhawan drives it down to long-offRahane is looking very good. It's very important that Dhawan too plays his part and not let the pressure get the better of his partner.
INDIA:20.6 Behardien to Dhawan, 1 run, fullish and just outside off stump, Dhawan punches it down to long off
INDIA:20.5 Behardien to Rahane, 1 run, poor line and Behardien gets away with it. Full and down the leg-side, Rahane glances it fine, but short fine leg intervenes
INDIA:20.4 Behardien to Rahane, 2 runs, again the timing is very good. Full and on the leg stump, Rahane flicks it past mid-wicket, the fielder in the deep slides to his left and saves two
INDIA:20.3 Behardien to Rahane, FOUR, Rahane gets to his fifty in style, his 13th in ODIs and he raises his bat to acknowledge the applause from the capacity crowd. Full and outside off stump, Rahane drives inside-out, the timing is so good that it beats extra-cover, Morris runs to his left from long-off and dives, but loses the race
INDIA:20.2 Behardien to Rahane, no run, Rahane races down the track and drives the full ball back to the bowler

INDIA:19.5 Tahir to Dhawan, FOUR, finally, after 54 balls, Dhawan's strike-rate crosses 100. Calculated hit from the left-hander. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Dhawan gets down on one knee and sweeps it through the vacant backward square leg region
INDIA:19.4 Tahir to Rahane, 1 run, fast and on the leg stump, Rahane sweeps it to fine leg
INDIA:19.3 Tahir to Rahane, no run, in the airrr and safe. Rahane was looking to advance, but Tahir dragged his length back, Rahane sliced the cut and it went on the bounce to backward point
INDIA:19.2 Tahir to Rahane, 2 runs, top edge and it lands safely. Great effort from Miller to prevent the boundary. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Rahane goes for the slog-sweep, gets it on the outside half of the bat, Miller runs to his left from deep mid-wicket, dives and just flicks it back in time. Oh hang on! The umpire is checking. It's very close, looks like Miller's right foot was touching the rope when he was in contact with the ball. This is shocking, I could clearly see Miller touching the rope there, but the third umpire has given the benefit of the doubt to the fielder
INDIA:19.1 Tahir to Dhawan, 1 run, flighted delivery just outside off stump, Dhawan advances and drives it down to long-off
INDIA:18.6 Behardien to Dhawan, 1 run, risky run and Dhawan escapes, a direct-hit would have been very interesting. Dhawan punches this short of length delivery off the back foot towards extra-cover, he was slow to take off, Tahir had a shy at the bowler's end but missed

INDIA:17.5 Tahir to Rahane, no run, hit on the pad, appeal for LBW, but umpire Anil Kumar Chaudhary shakes his head. This was the googly from Tahir, Rahane missed the flick, the ball hit Rahane around leg stump line but it was slipping down the leg-side, Rahane thinks about a quick single, sent back and he had to dive to get back to the crease
INDIA:17.4 Tahir to Dhawan, 1 run, googly from Tahir, Dhawan taps it softly to point for a quick single
INDIA:17.3 Tahir to Dhawan, no run, Dhawan was actually try to paddle sweep, but he changes his mind as the ball was outside off stump and dabbed into the off-side
INDIA:17.2 Tahir to Rahane, 1 run, flatter delivery on the leg stump, Rahane tucks it to mid-wicket
INDIA:17.1 Tahir to Rahane, SIX, gee! Take a bow Jinks! He looks very determined. He played this on one leg, yet timed it to perfection. Rahane races down the track and lofts the flighted delivery handsomely over long-on, not that hard, but the timing was so sweet
INDIA:16.6 Behardien to Dhawan, no run, oh this one swung back in very late and almost went through Dhawan's defences. He was late on the drive and the inside edge thudded into the pad

INDIA:16.2 Behardien to Rahane, 1 run, yorker length delivery and on off, squeezed out towards long-on for a single
INDIA:16.1 Behardien to Dhawan, 1 run, fuller length delivery and just outside off, punched down towards long-off for a singleDrinks are on the field now. India's run-rate is 6 RPO, that's pretty good going, but the required rate has jumped to double digits. Rahane is playing a gem, but Dhawan is still struggling to find the best form.

INDIA:12.5 Behardien to Rahane, 1 run, magic from AB and he nearly had his man! This was full and well outside off, Rahane was looking to drive and mistimed it wide of mid-off.

Rahane was sprawling on the ground and just about beats the throwAppeal for a run-out, Rahane's dive has saved him. NOT OUT should be the call
INDIA:12.4 Behardien to Rahane, no run, on a good length and on Rahane's pads, whipped straight to the fielder at short fine
INDIA:12.3 Behardien to Rahane, 2 runs, that will go down as a chance, Elgar is the culprit, this was a low full toss and outside leg, Rahane was looking to flick, closed the face of the bat a tad too early, gets a thick edge - high and behind square.

Rohit is on strike. Steyn will open the attackSouth Africa are in a huddle.. The Indian openers walk out. It will be Steyn to start off. One slip in place..Welcome back.. India looked shell-shocked at the end of South Africa's carnage. Remember - Johannesburg, 2006? Who will be India's Gibbs? Who will play the role of Mick Lewis? Or will India simply collapse. There's one chance though, if there's any rain and the match is reduced to a 20-overs chase, India will need to be at 158/0 to end up on the winning note.de Kock: 'It's been good. There are good wickets here and you got to cash in when you can. Everytime I come here, I want to do well. I was extremely happy to get to my hundred. It's a good surface, it might change now. It was a little slower but it might quicken up. Hopefully, we can take a couple of wickets early on, hopefully there will be a bit of movement. This has just become a normal thing for AB (talking about de Villiers' knock). He doesn't even celebrate like he used to. Just puts his bat up and says thank you.'On the other hand, India would rue the fact that they dropped a slew of catches. Mohit dropped de Kock. Mishra and Rahane shelled one chance each. du Plessis was the lucky batsman on both occasions.The only bowler, who offered some control for MS Dhoni was Harbhajan Singh. Bhuvneshwar went for 106 runs in his quota of 10 overs. He now has given away the most runs by an Indian in ODIs. It is a flat deck and the outfield is lightning fast. However, the Indian batsmen have a herculean task on their hands.Interestingly, every time he has reached a fifty, he has converted it into a century against India. Once de Kock was prised out by Suresh Raina, de Villiers took over and recorded his third century of the series. He posted his century in a mere 57 balls. Even when he miscued a pull off Bhuvneshwar in the 39th over, it sailed into the stands. His innings consisted of a mere three fours and as many as 11 sixes!Even when one hand came off the bat handle, he was able to loft Bhuvneshwar Kumar for a boundary through the off-side in the 44th over. Eventually, he retired hurt due to cramps. Lest we forget that de Kock and de Villiers too flayed India's attack. After Hashim Amla was chugged down at the start of the innings by Mohit, de Kock essayed some sparkling lofted shots. In particular, du Plessis, once he reached his century smashed the opposition to smithereens. In the 43rd over bowled by Axar Patel, he played a volley of thunderous strokes by thwacking three sixes and a boundary. Remember, he was suffering from cramps, yet he continued to muscle the ball and scythed it through all corners of the ground.It turned out to be a run-feast at the Wankhade stadium in Mumbai as the tourists ended up with a monstrous total. South Africa's total is the third highest score in ODIs. Quinton de Kock, AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis all cracked thrill-a-minute tons. The bowlers were smacked as though it is a shooting range and spectators ducked for cover in the stands.4
SOUTH AFRICA:49.6 Harbhajan to D Miller, 1 run, South Africa finish with 438! This is the third highest total in ODI cricket. Coming back to the ball, this was floated up outside off, Miller lofts it inside-out over extra cover, there's protection in the deep and it will only be a single

SOUTH AFRICA:48.2 Bhuvneshwar to D Miller, FOUR, they keep bowling short and they keep going for runs. However, the Indians are not learning their lessons. Short and at the batsman, Miller once again pulls it in the gap between deep square leg and deep mid-wicket, who had no chance of stopping that

SOUTH AFRICA:47.3 Mishra to Behardien, 1 run, Raina puts down a dolly now! It has been that sort of a day for the Indians. He probably took it too casually.

A slower ball bumper on the stumps, de Villiers goes for the hook, gets a top-edge and the keeper takes a simple catch. Kohli pats de Villiers on the back as he makes his way back to the dressing room. The crowd too are up on their feet.

SOUTH AFRICA:46.2 Bhuvneshwar to de Villiers, SIX, that's a mammoth hit! There was a cracking sound that came off the bat as it made contact with the ball. Full and on the stumps, de Villiers lofts it through the line and it sails way, way over the long-on fence

Is there any stopping this man?
SOUTH AFRICA:45.5 Mohit Sharma to de Villiers, 2 runs, The Superman has done it. de Villiers gets to his 23rd ODI ton, his third of the series. The crowd once again starts shouting 'ABD, ABD'.

We saw Bhuvi bang the ball short in the last game and get three wickets in his final spell. However, it was a slow wicket back in Chennai and he will have to rethink his strategy.
SOUTH AFRICA:32.6 Kohli to du Plessis, no run, wow! Excellent yorker, was bowled at just 98.8kph, yet, Faf was hurried.

The innings is just 19 overs old and Harbhajan Singh, India's best bowler so far, has already bowled as many as 7 overs. Plenty of problems for Dhoni. A lot of power-hitters to come.

Out come the two South African openers as well.Pitch Report: 'It's a terrific pitch. There's a bit of grass on the surface and there should be some bounce as well. It's a hot day, it's an even surface and we are in for a big scoring match', reckon Sunil Gavaskar and Graeme SmithTeams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohit SharmaSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Dean Elgar, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Imran TahirMS Dhoni: "We would have batted as well. Because heat is a factor and also because of the fact that South Africa don't like to chase. The wicket is slightly soft. We are playing the same side. The spinners get a bit of bounce here even if there is not much of turn, that's a good thing. I always have great memories of the 2011 World Cup final, but this a fresh start. We will try and split the fielding sessions into small bits and win it."AB de Villiers: "We are going to bat first. It's a deciding game, it's a final, so it will be nice to have runs on the board. We want to put pressure on India by batting first. Two changes, Elgar and Abbott are playing, Morris and Phangiso are missing out. I might chip in for a few overs if needed. It might be a bit of hard work for the first 10-15 overs, but once we get in and set a nice foundation, we feel we can expose the Indian bowling line-up a bit."South Africa have won the toss and have opted to batRohit Sharma: "I've been keeping it very simple. I've been working on a few things. As a batsman you want to improve everytime. I'm focused on what I need to do. It's nice that I've been able to contribute. It's an important game for us, hopefully I will score some runs and help the team. It's very hot, but we have to adjust to the conditions. We've had different conditions in all the venues we've played so far. It's pretty hot and humid here, but the boys are up for it. This is my first ODI at home, it's a special feeling. This is where I've played all my cricket."India have some happy recent memories at the Wankhede ground. They have won their last four ODIs here - with one of them being the 2011 World Cup final. But they haven't played here since October, 2011, a good four years back. The team has changed almost entirely in complexion, with only four players featuring today from the eleven that played against England on 23rd October, 2011. It also means Rohit Sharma will be playing his first international ODI in front of his home crowd. Can he make it an event to remember? Toss and team updates in a while..A tour of India is a test of a batsman's fortitude, patience and the ability to play on square turners. Chennai was perhaps the first turner that the visitors encountered and barring AB - they didn't acquit themselves well. Hashim Amla however reckons that it was just a minor blip and expects the batsmen to do well in future. The Wankhede stadium presents different challenges. The seamers enjoy the conditions more - with the cool breeze coming from the sea assisting them further. However, they are not without their own fair share of problems. JP Duminy has already been ruled out and doubts remain about Morne Morkel's fitness. They played an extra bowler in Chennai and it came back to bite them during their batting stint.Having tinkered with their batting combinations, India seem to have found the perfect combination in Chennai. Notwithstanding the opening troubles, it was almost a perfect match for Dhoni & Co. Virat Kohli scored his first hundred since the World Cup encounter against Pakistan, there were useful contributions from under pressure batsmen, Ajinkya Rahane and Suresh Raina. With runs on the board and the track helping spinners, the Indian bowlers came to the party, despite a valiant century from AB de Villiers.12:05 Local Time, 06:35 GMT, 12:05 IST: South Africa drew first blood in Kanpur, India replied in kind in Indore. The visitors once again went ahead in Rajkot but the hosts fought back superbly to level the series in Chennai. Today is the final chance for both teams, the team losing will have no chance of staging a comeback. Remember, South Africa have never won a bilateral ODI series in India. On the other hand, India haven't lost a home bilateral ODI series since losing to Pakistan during the 2012-13 season. It's a proud record and the hosts will not like to lose it. Hello, and a warm welcome to the fifth and final ODI between India and South Africa. We are at the Wankhede stadium, Mumbai, a ground where India have never lost an ODI to South Africa.Preview:The iconic Wankhede stadium in Mumbai is primed for a top-quality tussle on Sunday as India and South Africa seek to fight it out for the One-Day International (ODI) series honours. For all the criticism and scrutiny faced by Dhoni and his men, they have done well to claw their way back from two high-pressure deficits to gain parity and a shot at bragging rights. As for the visitors, they have thrilled and fallen flat alternatively, and will hope to bring a fruitful end to the pattern in the finale. From the injury to lead spinner Ravichandran Ashwin to a top-order batting combination conundrum, hosts India have had to deal with a plethora of issues. Yet, a win just ahead of the decider has given them much-needed momentum ahead of Sunday's clash. While Dhoni has used his spinners to good effect and done well to keep the run flow in check in the middle overs, the recent ODI rule change has enabled both sides pose a bigger challenge to each other as a fielding side in the final ten overs. Virat Kohli's return to form with an authoritative century all but solves the batting order woes - slotting Kohli at No. 3, Ajinkya Rahane at 4 with Dhoni and Raina taking the No. 5 and 6 positions based on the situation. The No. 7 batsman remains a grey area but it would be highly uncharacteristic of Dhoni to tinker with a winning combination. Shikhar Dhawan's poor run of form is also a concern but the Southpaw will be more than eager to play a big role in the decider.Kohli's return to menacing form has compounded South Africa's tryst with injuries as the absence of fast bowler Morne Morkel and all-rounder JP Duminy has had severe repercussions on the team composition. Chris Morris matches Morkel with his tall frame but fails as far as impact is concerned. Left-arm spinner Aaron Phangiso couldn't replicate the effectiveness of JP Duminy's in the middle overs as the Indian batters took him apart in the Chennai ODI. The South African think-tank will have quite a task to decide on the line-up - whether to beef up their batting by bringing in Dean Elgar in place of Phangiso and take the punt of splitting the latter's quota of ten overs between Elgar and part-time medium-pacer Farhaan Behardien or persist with Phangiso and expect the batters to put on a better show. Going by the lofty standards set by himself, Hashim Amla has flattered to deceive in the four games so far - aggregating 66 at a forgettable average of 16.50. A typically solid knock from Amla at the top-order could set the tone for the rest to follow. It will also be interesting to see where David Miller features in the line-up. The baby-faced big-hitter has endured a lean patch similar to Kohli's, but unlike his Indian counterpart, is yet to shrug it off. De Villiers has spoken highly of the left-hander and even tried to accommodate him as an opener to help him score some runs early on when the ball comes onto the bat nicely. Miller has a best of 33 out of his 52 in four innings and needs to turn his form over to ease the pressure on his versatile skipper. De Villiers was in the mood to produce a special knock in Chennai and seal the series but the lack of a batting partner came as a roadblock.
