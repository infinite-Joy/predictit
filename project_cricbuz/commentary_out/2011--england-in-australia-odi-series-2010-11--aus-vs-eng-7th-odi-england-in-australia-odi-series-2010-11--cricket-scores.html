Tait will open the attackIt has been a fantastic recovery from Australia. After winning the toss on a good pitch, the Aussie openers got off to a slow start. The England bowlers maintained a tight line and generated some good bounce on this wicket. Haddin and White were bogged down by the pressure and gifted their wickets away. David Hussey and Adam Voges stepped upto the plate and strung together a brilliant 95 run partnership for the fifth wicket. Voges also went past his 2nd ODI fifty and Australia managed to score 48 runs in the Batting PP to reach 279/7. England did not help their cause one bit by bowling 30 extras, which included 19 wides. It will be a tough score to chase for the Poms. Join us in a short while for their reply.4

Good start for him.Australia have won the toss and elected to batAfter five gruelling Test matches, two T20s and six close ODIs, we finally come to the end of the Australian summer. Hello and welcome to the seventh and final ODI between Australia and England at Perth. This series is becoming a series plagued with injuries. Paul Collingwood has flown home with a back injury while Eoin Morgan has sustained a fractured finger and will miss out on this ODI. Australia's Steven Smith is also out with a hip injury. England will be looking to break their WACA jinx against Australia as they aim to win an ODI against the old enemy after 24 years. The weather is perfect and Perth and the toss is a few minutes away.The preview by Gokul GopalTwo sides with numerous injury problems face off against each other in the final ODI of the series at Perth but the home team is sitting pretty having already taken a 5-1 lead.Australia:The Australians have been impressive throughout the ODI series despite the 3-1 Ashes drubbing. Although they have had a string of injury problems with Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey not playing the series due to a finger and hamstring injury respectively, Shaun Marsh injuring his hamstring mid-way into the series, Xavier Doherty injuring his back, Nathan Hauritz suffering a shoulder dislocation and the latest addition to this list - Steven Smith, who had a hip injury during the 6th ODI when Australia successfully chased down a target of 334, the hosts have found players who have risen up to make light of the absence of key players during different parts of the 7-match series. Shane Watson has been best of the lot, scoring 306 runs in 6 ODIs at an average of 61.20 including 2 fifties and a hundred. Michael Clarke too has impressed, both with his captaincy as well as batting, helping Australia retain the tough competitors tag that they have been holding for decades. On the bowling front, it could not have been a better comeback for pace spearhead Brett Lee, who has kept the Englishmen on their toes throughout the series. Steven Smith has also rendered good performances with the ball while re-establishing his status as the allrounder in the side.However, the Aussies have their task cut-out if they are seeking a 6-1 finish to the series. With Michael Clarke and Shane Watson being rested for the final ODI, Cameron White, who will take over as the captain, needs his team to perform in the same consistent way that they have been doing over the past 26 days. Adam Voges, who replaces Shane Watson for the game and Jason Krezja, who comes in for Steven Smith, do not have much time to settle down and get into the Australian scheme of things.England:The English, on the other hand, have been unlike what was seen during the Ashes. The toughness and the mental strength to go for the kill has been missing from the England outfit during the ODI series. Apart from Jonathan Trott, who has been the highest scorer in the series from both sides, there has hardly been a performance praise-worthy. The middle order has failed for England in 3 matches while the bowlers have failed to defend totals in excess of 290 in a couple of matches. England team too has been hampered with injuries throughout the series. Especially it is the bowling attack that has been disconcerted with the absence of Stuart Broad (stomach injury), Graeme Swann (back injury), Ajmal Shahzad (hamstring injury) and the latest being Paul Collingwood (back injury) and Tim Bresnan (calf injury). England have nothing but pride to play for as they look to avoid Michael Clarke's prediction of a 6-1 series win for Australia.Quotes:Without a doubt the length of the tour is a reason for the injuries. We've been here over three months now and with the intensity at which the guys play their cricket, and with the intensity that we demand in training, it is no surprise that people will pick up injuries and break down at the end of a long, hard tour: England coach Andy Flower, mentioning the reason for the spate of injuries.It is a bit of a different side, but there are a lot of guys there who have played one-day cricket for Australia. I think we've still got a well-balanced one-day side going into this last game, and we are taking a lot of confidence into it. We are still the number one one-day side in the world so hopefully we win this series 6-1: Mitchell Johnson saying that the confidence in the camp was rising all the time.Teams:Australia (From): Cameron White(c), Brad Haddin(w), Callum Ferguson, Adam Voges, David Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, John Hastings, Doug Bollinger, Shaun Tait, Peter Siddle, Jason KrejzaEngland (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Matt Prior(w), Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Eoin Morgan, Chris Woakes, Luke Wright, Michael Yardy, James Anderson, Steven Finn, James Tredwell, Liam Plunkett, Chris Tremlett, Ajmal Shahzad, Graeme Swann, Paul Collingwood, Tim Bresnan, Steve DaviesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
