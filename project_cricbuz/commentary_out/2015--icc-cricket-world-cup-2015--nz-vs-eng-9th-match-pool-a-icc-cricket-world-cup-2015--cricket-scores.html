It's just a formality for the Black Caps now. The players are striding out. New Zealand need 12 runs to win off 246 balls.New Zealand raced to 103 off just 40 balls as Baz continued to smash the England bowlers. However, Woakes came on and knocked him over with a full toss and sent him back for a 25-ball 77. The Black Caps need just 12 more runs to complete a thumping win. Take a break and join us back at 18:15 Local Time for the last rites.Phew! After Tim Southee derailed England with a 7-wicket haul, some insane batting from Brendon McCullum has blown them away. Baz made his intentions very clear from the start. He smashed Stuart Broad for a six and a hat-trick of fours in the second over to push England on the back foot. Since then, Eoin Morgan & Co. found it very tough to keep him calm. When Finn came on to bowl in the 4th over of the innings, McCullum hit him for two fours and two sixes. He then bludgeoned four consecutive sixes in Finn's second over and also completed the fastest ever World Cup fifty, it was also the fastest fifty for New Zealand in ODIs.The umpires have called for the dinner break. The crowd don't like it, they are booing as umpire Tucker takes the bails off to end the session. Well, one can understand their feelings. New Zealand need just 12 runs, but the umpires went by the rules.

He asks the square leg umpire for height and it has been sent upstairs. It's not above the waist and he has to go. The Cake Tin gives him a standing ovation. What a knock he's played. McCullum tried to hit the new bowler out of the park, the ball takes a thin outside edge and crashes into middle and leg. McCullum can't believe he's missed out on a freebie.

Guptill is on strike. J Anderson will open the attackSo then, the England players are striding out. McCullum and Guptill walk out as well. Are they going to go hard at England? We'll find out soon.Southee: "We are good swing bowlers and, though we lost the toss, it swung around the whole innings. The ball stayed in reasonable shape. It's an amazing feeling. The atmosphere here has been amazing and it's a pleasure to play in front of them. We've done half of the job, but they have quality bowlers."For England, only Joe Root showed the technique and application to play the swinging ball well. Rest of the batsmen paid the price for hanging back in the crease. England have an uphill task on their hands to make a comeback into the game after being bowled out for a paltry score. Brendon McCullum, New Zealand's captain, also deserves the credit for setting aggressive fields. When New Zealand's key bowlers, Trent Boult and Southee were bowling, he had four slips. He also showed tactical nous when Eoin Morgan was dismissed by bringing Southee back into the attack. Southee responded by taking a slew of wickets. To make it even better, New Zealand fielded brilliantly, with McCullum leading the way. Tim Southee produced a wonderful exhibition of swing bowling to put New Zealand on top. Southee generated prodigious swing, bowled a full length and used the crease to hoop it around the corners and trouble all the English batsmen. He started on a good note by shattering the stumps of Ian Bell, with the one that left the right-hander. He set-up Bell's opening partner, Moeen Ali beautifully with a bouncer before uprooting the stumps with a searing yorker. He followed it up by taking the wickets of James Taylor, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad and Steven Finn to finish with seven wickets to his name. It turned out to be the first time a bowler from New Zealand took seven wickets in One-Day cricket.New Zealand are absolutely ecstatic and Tim Southee leads them off the field. If he had got one more wicket, he would have snatched the record from Glenn McGrath for the best bowling figures in World Cups.3
ENGLAND:33.2 Milne to J Root, out Caught by Vettori!! That's it! England have been bowled out for 123. Southee cannot get the best bowling figures in World Cup cricket.

McCullum leads New Zealand's huddle. The batsmen are out in the middle as well.Right, it's time for the anthems. It's 'God save the Queen' - England's first up and then followed by the anthem of New Zealand.Pitch Report: "It's obviously a drop-in pitch. This particular one was last used against India and I think they scored 300. It is rock hard and well-grassed. It might provide a bit of pace and bounce. We have two very good pace attacks on show today, but essentially it is a very, very good pitch and we should have a few runs in store for us," reckons Michael Atherton.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Trent BoultEngland (Playing XI): Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, James AndersonEngland have won the toss and have opted to batMorgan: "The guys have trained really hard. We obviously underperformed by quite a long way in all three departments, so we will look to improve on that today. We will bat first. The wicket looks good, it might not change much. We are going in with the same team. Hopefully, I can get some time in the middle and some runs under my belt. I've struggled in the last couple of games to get a score, so hopefully today is the day."McCullum: "Cricket is obviously important for the country at the moment. When you play good cricket, people want to turn up and watch. It is a loud ground and a packed house is going to be outstanding. The tag (when asked about his thoughts on New Zealand being tagged as favourites for this contest) doesn't matter once the game gets underway. We would have batted as well. Looks a cracking wicket, hopefully it stays the same throughout the game. If we can do the first part well, then we certainly make the second part a lot easier. We are unchanged for this game. We are a little bit lucky that we have been playing a lot of cricket recently, so the guys are pretty tuned to playing a lot of games in a short space of time."Folks, we are not too far away from the toss. As said earlier, New Zealand are fielding an unchanged side for this game. Stay tuned for England's XI.Head-to-head:New Zealand have a slight advantage over England on head-to-head count in ODIs. Overall, they have won 38 matches and lost 33. When it comes to World Cup cricket though, there is not much to choose between these two sides as New Zealand only lead by a slender margin of 4-3. However, it is a concern for England that they have not beaten the Black Caps in their last four World Cup meetings.Weather: It is bright and sunny out there. With a high of 22 degrees, both teams will find the weather pleasant and good for cricket. There are no chances of rain and we should get a full match.EnglandEoin Morgan and Co. haven't had a great beginning to the tournament. Having bizarrely opted to field on a good batting surface at the MCG, the England bowlers found it hard to stop Aaron Finch, who was instrumental in Australia posting a massive total on the board. In reply, the English batsmen could not handle the pressure of the chase and gave Mitchell Marsh his first 5-wicket haul, before suffering a crushing 111-run defeat. However, there were two positives to take from that game. Steve Finn continued his good form with the ball and took a hat-trick at the fag end of the innings, which also helped him bag a fifer. James Taylor played no-fear cricket and scored 98 aggressive runs, only to be denied a hundred by an umpiring blunder.Although, Eoin Morgan has registered scores of 0 2 0 0 0 in his last 5 innings, he has received strong backing from batting coach Mark Ramprakash. "Look, he's aware of the fact that he wants more runs and it's important for the team that he plays his part. But in terms of handling the tournament, the pressures of it, you couldn't really ask for a better character to be able to handle that," said Ramprakash.In fact, Morgan's counterpart, McCullum, too expects him to come good. "He's a champion player. He's one of my better mates from around the world in terms of cricket. He's going through a bit of a tough time at the moment, but tough times don't last, tough blokes do. So hopefully at some point he'll come out of it. Hopefully tomorrow we're able to keep him quiet. But I am very confident at some point he'll bounce out of it because he's a quality player and a tough bloke too," said McCullum.New ZealandThe Black Caps began their campaign on a great note on Valentine's Day. After being asked to bat first by Sri Lanka, fine fifties from Brendon McCullum, Kane Williamson and Corey Anderson helped the World Cup co-hosts post a very good total of 331, which was later easily defended by the bowlers. When they bowled Scotland out for a mere 142 in their second match, everyone thought New Zealand would cruise to victory, but with Scotland picking 7 wickets, a bit of vulnerability was exposed in their batting."It got a little scarier than we wanted, I guess. When I'm rushing around the changing room trying to check the pairs on it, it means we might be in a little bit of trouble. But, yeah, in the end we got the points and we got the job done, so, yeah, pretty satisfying," said Trent Boult, who was named the Man of the Match. However, Boult was quick to point out that their performance against Scotland will not affect New Zealand going forward.Meanwhile, speaking ahead of today's match New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum revealed that his side would play the same team, that took the field in the first two games. The wicket-keeper batsman was also wary of England's bowling attack and admitted that they will pose a tough challenge. "I think they have a good bowling attack. They have a bit of pace and they get some bounce with (Stuart) Broad and (James) Anderson. So they're going to pose some different challenges to what we've probably faced in the last little while, but it's a challenge the boys are looking forward to," said McCullum.When reminded about his side being tagged as one of the title-favourites, the 33-year-old had this to say: "It's kind of irrelevant, I think, the tag. We're the favourites, we're the underdogs, once you get out on the pitch, you start on an even keel. I think we've been able to handle some of the expectation which has risen recently because of our calmness within the group."As we build up to this contest, let's have a close look at the teams and their performances thus far in the 2015 Cricket World Cup.Hello there! We head to the Cake Tin today for this cracking Group A fixture, featuring the co-hosts, New Zealand, and England. Both sides have a very good bowling attack and there is no doubt that the intensity is going to be pretty high on the field. This is the first time that the Westpac Stadium in Wellington is hosting a World Cup game. Having lost their tournament opener, England are slightly under pressure going into this contest. In fact, the last time these two sides met in a World Cup game in Wellington, in 1992, New Zealand registered a comfortable 7-wicket win, although the game was played at Basin Reserve. So maybe, New Zealand have that psychological advantage.Preview:New Zealand and England couldn't have had a more contrasting start to the World Cup. After suffering a trouncing at the hands of Australia, England now travel to Wellington to face the other co-hosts of the tournament, also incidentally in equally good form. New Zealand, on the other hand, dispatched Sri Lanka rather convincingly in their tournament opener and despite stuttering to a victory against Scotland, they would look to establish their dominance in favourable conditions.Also on view will be two equally impressive bowling attacks squaring off against each other. While James Anderson and co. didn't find their rhythm against Australia, New Zealand's bowlers have been spot on in both their previous matches and would look to do more of the same against England.Venue: Westpac Stadium, WellingtonDate: February 20, 2015Time: 0630 Hrs ISTWeather: Partly sunny with a high of 21 degreesTeam newsNew ZealandEven though captain Brendon McCullum disclosed that his team would run ragged after playing three games inside seven days, he stressed it would be the same team that will play against England. Victories in their first two matches has meant that a win over England here would take them even closer to a spot in the quarter-finals, and New Zealand would like to take those odds. However, their batting wasn't challenged against Sri Lanka and against England they face a bowling unit similar to theirs in many ways.After an easy victory over Sri Lanka and then over Scotland - even though they were stretched by the minnows - England would be New Zealand's toughest test yet. Guarding against complacency would be their priority as England's batsmen would present themselves as tougher competitors as compared to Scotland. While New Zealand would be looking to keeping England captain Eoin Morgan under the pump, they very well know that Ross Taylor hasn't had the best of times with the bat either, and therein lies a chink in their armour.Probable XI: 1. Martin Guptill, 2. Brendon McCullum (capt), 3. Kane Williamson, 4. Ross Taylor, 5. Grant Elliott, 6. Corey Anderson, 7. Luke Ronchi (wk), 8. Daniel Vettori, 9. Adam Milne, 10. Tim Southee, 11. Trent Boult.EnglandTheir World Cup opening loss was an extension of their fortunes in the tri-series where they were repeatedly exposed by Australia, but England know they are a better side than the result reflected at the MCG. Another defeat would mount pressure on the side to come back and stay in contention for the last eight, hence a victory over New Zealand would be that much more important.Four ducks in his last five innings has piled the pressure on captain Eoin Morgan, but a smaller ground could help him to quite literally break his duck. Morgan scored a hundred at the SCG not too long ago, and can hence opt to play himself in instead of looking to be adventurous right from the start.Steven Finn's five-wicket haul - which also included a hat-trick - has more or less ensured England would go into the game with the same bowling combination, but it is the batting where they need more contributions from. James Taylor's superb rearguard should be an inspiration for the rest of the batsmen. Even though they were blown away by Australia on Saturday, England wouldn't be looking at pressing the panic button anytime soon, and stick with the same combination of batsmen.Probable XI: 1. Ian Bell, 2. Moeen Ali, 3. Gary Ballance/Ravi Bopara, 4. Joe Root, 5. Eoin Morgan (capt), 6. James Taylor, 7. Jos Buttler (wk), 8. Chris Woakes, 9. Stuart Broad, 10. Steven Finn, 11. James Anderson.Watch out forRoss Taylor has quietly slipped under the radar as New Zealand have registered victories despite the batsman's poor form, but against a potent England bowling attack, he would be required to put his wealth of experience on display. Taylor has repeatedly shown his anxiety to get amongst the runs, and it may prompt him to play himself in before unleashing his complete range of shots.England's wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler has become a bit of an X-factor in the team and his runs from No 7 have meant the team doesn't quite throw in the towel. A brittle top order has meant Buttler has had to negotiate more overs than he would like to, but he could be required to play another stellar role in keeping England's chances in the World Cup alive.Quotes"They have a bit of pace and they get some bounce with (Stuart) Broad and (James) Anderson.
