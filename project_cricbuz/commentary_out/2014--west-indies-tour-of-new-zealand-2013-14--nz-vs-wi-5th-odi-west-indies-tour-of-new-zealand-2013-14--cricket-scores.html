The hosts have an unassailable lead of 2-1 and they would like to finish on 3-1. West Indies have not been at their best throughout the series. They somehow scrapped through in the first match, but after that it has all been the Kiwis. Injuries to some of their key players has not helped their cause either. The last match will be important for them to restore back some pride. The weather has played spoil sport in the last two matches. However, the forecast says we should not have any interruptions today. Toss and teams coming up in a few minutes.....PreviewNew Zealand: So the Black Caps are just one win away from rounding up an excellent home season after the disappointments of Bangladesh. They have defeated West Indies in the Test series and taken an unbeatable lead in the ODIs, thanks to some powerful batting. Corey Anderson and Jesse Ryder brought the New Year in with a bang and while Martin Guptill followed up with a fluent 81 in the next game to make sure the Kiwis took a 2-1 lead, with one game abandoned due to rain.The players also got a boost, with as many as 12 from the ODI squad retained for the T20 Internationals, a clear signal that these players will form the core of the side with the World Cup now only a year away. A series win over a shattered West Indies will be a huge fillip ahead of India's arrival.Key Players: Anderson, Ryder and Guptill as usual will be the big threats with the bat while Tim Southee's presence in the bowling line-up will also play in the minds of the West Indian players. This New Zealand unit looks sharp and focussed at home.West Indies: They have been broken and shattered. After the disaster in India, West Indies have not been able to do any better in New Zealand either. They were crushed in the Test series while Corey Anderson's brutal assault on January 1 seems to have further damage on the tired travellers. The bowling continued to look ordinary in Nelson and Darren Sammy's absence from the ranks has further weakened the teamHowever, West Indies do have some dangerous limited overs players, none more so than Dwayne Bravo. The captain can destroy any attack on his day and the camp would be hoping he leads by example so they can at least walk away with honours even in the ODI series.Key Players: With Sammy out of the tour, Dwayne Bravo is the single biggest threat for New Zealand. The West Indian captain showed traces of his brilliance, finishing as the most successful bowler (2/35) and remaining unbeaten on 43 off 55 balls, albeit in a losing cause. If he fires, West Indies have a chance of leveling the series. But the question is, can he?Quotes I thought it was a pretty quick one but I did not realize it was the fastest.
