Nuwan Kulasekara will open the attackThe players are out in the middle and are ready to get this game underway. We will have to wait for a bit because there seems to be a slight problem with the sight screenSo Jadeja gets to play ahead of Yusuf Pathan and Manoj Tiwary has to warm the bench again. Fair tactics by Dhoni and the team management?Teams:India (Playing XI): Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Irfan Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Vinay KumarSri Lanka (Playing XI): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Upul Tharanga, Chamara Kapugedera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Farveez Maharoof, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Seekkuge PrasannaDhoni: We were also looking to bowl first. There is good competition in the side the youngsters are pushing each other. I am happy with the team I have got but we are going through a transition period but as I said there is a lot of competition within the dressing room and that is good because it brings out the best from the team. It is good to have someone like Sachin in the team because he settles the small and the big things and he has a lot of experience under his belt.Mahela: We are going to bowl first, it looks like a different wicket and we think the ball will come on to the bat in the second half of the innings. Obviously because of the amount of cricket we have been playing it has put a strain on the guys and we are carrying some injuries. But I think it is also a good opportunity for someone to fill in. We are in good form, but that was in Australia, we need to adapt to the conditions and play well here now.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch report: The pitch looks to have a greenish tinge and is different from the one that was used in the 1st ODI. It should help the ball to come on to the bat easily. This pitch looks to be a very good one, the seamers should enjoy bowling on it but more than that the batsmen will enjoy the ball coming onto the bat. Sunil Gavaskar predicts 600 runs to be scored on this wicket.India and Sri Lanka are up against each other once again after a fortnight. This time the two teams take on each other in the Asia Cup. The conditions are completely different from Australia. There are some changes in both teams. A win for either team today will take them a long way ahead in the race for the finals. Hello, and a warm welcome to Match 2 of the Asia Cup.Fan Face-offIndia got the better of Sri Lanka for most part of the CB series but the Lankan side emerged better of the two sub-continent sides, making it to the final and stretching Australia in the best of three contest. The battle between India and Sri Lanka continues, only change is that the stage is a different one, the second match of the Asia Cup. But in conditions that both teams are accustomed to, it is to be seen which team has the final say. Ganesh Chandrasekaran thinks India is the better of the two sides but Gokul Gopal begs to differ. Here, they go head to head, trying to prove the sides they support will triumph.Gokul: Going by India's performance in the recently concluded CB series, and considering that Sri Lanka got a good measure of India Down Under, what different can be expected of Dhoni's men during the Asia Cup match against the Islanders?Ganesh: Sri Lanka can expect much of what they got against India in the CB series. India lost just once against Sri Lanka in the four games they played Down Under. The last time they met, India pounded Lanka courtesy a Kohli special. Sri Lanka might have gone on to the final but the head to head record speaks for itself. India have definitely got a good measure of Sri Lanka and that confidence is what they will bring into this game.Gokul: There is no Zaheer Khan in the Indian team, neither is there a Umesh Yadav or a Varun Aaron. Apart from Praveen, there is no other seamer who is capable of troubling the Lankan batters. Am I not right?Ganesh: Horses for courses. In Bangladesh, it is the spinners who will be in the limelight. The seamers will have to be content in playing a supporting role. Ravichandran Ashwin has proved his mettle in the shorter formats and so has Ravindra Jadeja. These two will be the key for India. Having said that, Ashok Dinda had a good domestic season and is a relatively new entity in the International arena. He could just be the man who catches the Lankas off guard.Gokul: Talks of the 100th ton have been around for a year now. Although he does not show it, the pressure of reaching the three figure mark will be playing on Tendulkar's mind and in turn affect the team. Is it going to be one more disappointing series for him?Ganesh: The pressure might be intense but it is not something new for Sachin. The whole build up has been a Shakespearean dramedy of sorts. Getting hundreds was what he was doing in his sleep. The constant expectations for a hundred has left a few other gems go unnoticed. His cameo against the Lankans in the game at Hobart will be fresh in their memory. So hundred or no hundred, Sachin remains a prized wicket for the opposition. You do know how the cliche goes Beware of a ..... and Form is temporary....Gokul: Finally, India's fielding has not been all that impressive and Dhoni too pointed that out recently which did not go all that well with the seniors in the side. The question, I have for you is - Can the Indian players put the bad blood aside and work as a team? (I don't think so)Ganesh: The team has come out in denial of all the speculations of a rift within the seniors. Even if there was, the central character in that plot, Virender Sehwag is not a part of the team in Bangladesh. Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni showed that they can still do well for India and even stitched together a couple of important partnerships in the CB series. That should answer the question. Okay your turn now.Ganesh: On tracks that have proven to assist spin bowlers, Sri Lanka have picked two rank new comers, Seekuge Prasanna and Sachitra Senanayake. And no. Despite his slower ones and cutters, Farveez Maharoof, cannot be considered a spinner. Does the bowling have the right balance and what it takes to stop the Indian batters?Gokul: I do agree that the spin department of the Sri Lankan team is relatively inexperienced. Prasanna and Senanayake definitely lack decent exposure to international cricket. But considering that Rangana Herath and Ajantha Mendis have been not in the best of forms, it is always a safe bet to give youngsters more opportunity. Plus, there is also Tillakaratne Dilshan in the Lankan side and he has proven that he can perform the role of a spinner. Coming to the quicks in the lineup, Lasith 'Slinga' Malinga is nothing short of a fearsome sight for the opposition and Nuwan Kulasekara's abilities as a frontline seamer is always under-rated. Suranga Lakmal also returns to boost the side. So the answer to your question - with a quality seam line up, a decent spin attack and presence of useful allrounders, Sri Lanka do have the right balance.Ganesh: Sri Lanka come into the tournament just four days after a draining CB series (more so since they lost the final) and the face an Indian team that is quite formidable in Asian conditions. Do the Lankans have it in them to bounce back in a short period?Gokul: Mahela Jayawardene and his men will not be looking too much into the loss in the finals of the CB series and instead, will take confidence from the fact that they gave the Australians a good run for the money. As far as not getting enough break between series, these are professional cricketers who are paid to do their work (Maybe not exactly paid as far as the Lankans are concerned) and are very much used to the rigours of international cricket. Moreover, In the Asia Cup, Sri Lanka are undoubtedly the fittest side and are as used to the the hot and humid conditions as the rest of their Asian counterparts.Ganesh: Thisara Perera and Angelo Mathews were not fit for the last final of the CB series but are now back in the team. The latter is also the vice captain of the team. Could they have really recovered so soon and if yes, Where does this leave someone like Upul Tharanga who did well in the same game?Gokul: Officially, there has been no news suggesting that Perera or Mathews are not fit for the Asia Cup neither is there anything to suggest they are in the best of their fitness. But, one thing for sure is that there are enough players in the team to make up for their loss in case they do miss out. But it is strange that this question is coming from an Indian fan since his team is better known to hide injuries.
