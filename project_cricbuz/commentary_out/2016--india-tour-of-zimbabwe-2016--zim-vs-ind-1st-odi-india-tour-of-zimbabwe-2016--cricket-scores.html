Rahul and Karun are the openers, understanding shouldn't be an issue then. Chatara with the new ball.. Two slips in place..It was the Indian bowlers who dictated the terms throughout the innings as Zimbabwe batting never got going. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals as they folded up for a below par total. Yuzvendra Chahal was impressive on his debut. The others bowlers chipped in as well. Even as wickets kept tumbling at one end, Chigumbura stood tall amidst the ruins and displayed a semblance of fight. This should be a stroll in the park for the Indian batsmen, but will Zimbabwe put up a fight? Join us in a while for the chase..4

This was pitched up in that corridor outside off, Raza's eyes lit up as he saw the width, went hard on the drive, his feet was rooted to the crease, ends up playing with an angled bat, gets a thick inside edge and the middle-stump is sent cartwheeling. Second wicket for Sran and Zimbabwe are in real trouble now. S Raza b Barinder 23(54) [4s-2]Barinder to S Raza, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
ZIMBABWE:37.2 Barinder to S Raza, no run, Sran shortens his length outside off, Raza takes a step down the track and pushes it back at the bowler
ZIMBABWE:37.1 Barinder to S Raza, no run, short of a good length and angling across the right-hander, Raza has a poke at that and misses
ZIMBABWE:36.6 Axar to S Raza, 1 run, another one on middle and leg, Raza bunts it down to long-on and he'll keep the strike as well. Axar finishes his spell, his figures read 10-1-26-1
ZIMBABWE:36.5 Axar to S Raza, no run, darted in on middle stump line, Raza defends from the crease
ZIMBABWE:36.4 Axar to S Raza, no run, Raza jumps down the track and Axar bowls it slightly wide outside off, Raza reaches out and in doing so he slips while making good enough contact with the ball. The ball rolls towards the backward point region and that gave the batsmen no chance to cross over
ZIMBABWE:36.3 Axar to Chigumbura, 1 run, another misfield and once again it's Manish Pandey. Dhoni isn't too happy. This was bowled quicker and fuller outside off, Chigumbura drives it straight to cover, where Pandey lets the ball slip through and the batsmen cross over
ZIMBABWE:36.2 Axar to Chigumbura, no run, slower through the air and aimed at the stumps, Chigumbura defends off the front foot

ZIMBABWE:35.4 Barinder to S Raza, 2 runs, length delivery angled across off, Raza stays on the back foot, opens the face of the bat and guides it to the left of a diving backward point, the batsmen pick two before third man gets to it after running to his right
ZIMBABWE:35.3 Barinder to S Raza, no run, slightly shortish but not enough width outside off. However, that doesn't stop Raza from slashing hard and he hit it well, only for Rahul to stop it at backward point after moving across to his right
ZIMBABWE:35.2 Barinder to S Raza, no run, on middle stump line this time around, Raza clips it straight to mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:35.1 Barinder to S Raza, no run, length delivery just outside off, was slightly slower as well. Raza stays put and defends it into the off-side with soft handsBarinder Sran [6.0-0-25-1] is back into the attackTime for another change as Barinder comes into the attack.Drinks are on the field now. Zimbabwe have five wickets in the bank, but they really need to press on the accelerator if they want to get to a reasonable total. Anything under 200 won't do in my opinion, but cricket always finds a way to get back at you, so it's better that I don't predict. Let's just see how these two fare after the drinks break.
ZIMBABWE:34.6 Axar to Chigumbura, no run, another quick delivery from Axar and Chigu is happy to keep it out with a defensive blade

ZIMBABWE:34.3 Axar to S Raza, 1 run, backs away a touch and cracks this shortish delivery in front of point, the batsmen go through for a quick single. There was a chance for an extra run because Dhoni couldn't collect the throw cleanly, but the batsmen don't risk it

ZIMBABWE:33.4 D Kulkarni to Chigumbura, no run, was that a wide? At least I thought so. The umpire though doesn't agree with me. Short and well wide outside off, Chigumbura lets it go and the umpire also lets it go
ZIMBABWE:33.3 D Kulkarni to S Raza, 1 run, on a good length and around off, Raza stabs it in front of cover and calls his partner through for a very quick single. Nicely done in the end

ZIMBABWE:31.6 D Kulkarni to S Raza, 1 run, bangs this short but it doesn't rise as much as he expected. Raza was quick on his feet to go across, swivels and pulls it to fine leg. He rolled his wrists to send it along the ground, he'll keep the strike as well

ZIMBABWE:30.6 Chahal to Chigumbura, no run, much quicker this time and once again he drifts onto the pads, Chigumbura tries to tuck it away into the leg-side, but fails to lay bat on it. The ball rolls away into the leg-side off the thigh pad

ZIMBABWE:11.2 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, fuller on middle and leg, Chibhabha prefers to hang back and work it to square leg, straight to Jadhav

ZIMBABWE:11.1 Barinder to C Ervine, wide, drifts it down leg, Ervine misses on the glance and it is another wide conceded by an Indian bowler
ZIMBABWE:10.6 Bumrah to Chibhabha, no run, gets away with one well outside off, was close to being called a wide. Chibhabha slashes at it and connects with thin air, umpire Gould reckons it was inside the tramline
ZIMBABWE:10.6 Bumrah to Chibhabha, wide, sprays it down leg and Chibhabha can't connect with the pull. Dhoni had to dive to his left to collect that. Bumrah suggests to the umpire that it kissed the thigh pad
ZIMBABWE:10.5 Bumrah to Chibhabha, no run, lands it on back of a length around off, blocked off the back foot down the wicket
ZIMBABWE:10.4 Bumrah to Chibhabha, no run, slightly fuller but not full enough to trouble Chibhabha, who hangs back and blocks it back to Bumrah
ZIMBABWE:10.3 Bumrah to Chibhabha, no run, again the length is short and Chibhabha is comfortable defending off the back foot
ZIMBABWE:10.2 Bumrah to C Ervine, leg byes, 1 run, back of a length and nips back in, Ervine can't lay bat on the flick and the ball goes off the thigh pad towards second slip, Chibhabha calls for a quick run and they get it easily in the end
ZIMBABWE:10.1 Bumrah to C Ervine, no run, Ervine can't do much with the free-hit. Bumrah spears in a yorker just outside off, Ervine is late in bringing his bat to jam it
ZIMBABWE:10.1 Bumrah to C Ervine, no ball, not the ideal start for Bumrah. Oversteps and concedes a free-hit. Full delivery around off, Ervine drives it straight to mid-onJasprit Bumrah, right-arm medium, comes into the attac
ZIMBABWE:9.6 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, pitched up on off, Chibhabha doesn't get the timing right on the drive, the bat face turns and he ends up mistiming it to mid-on
ZIMBABWE:9.5 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, back of a length on off and middle, Chibhabha tucks it towards mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:9.4 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, the left-armer's angle causing the problem. Sran is mixing it up well here. Shortens the length and pushes it across Chibhabha, who has a feel for it away from the body, beaten comprehensivelyBack over the wicket...
ZIMBABWE:9.3 Barinder to Chibhabha, 2 runs, this is a much easier angle for Chibhabha, shuffles across and works the back of a length delivery through mid-wicket for a coupleSwitches to round the wicket...
ZIMBABWE:9.2 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, again keeps it full and gets it to shape in, Chibhabha jams it off the toe-end onto his boot, the ball rolls to the off-side

ZIMBABWE:8.4 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, out Caught by Dhoni!! Lovely delivery from Dhawal. He finally has a wicket to his name. Has been beating the bat quite often, now gets one to brush the outside edge. Good length ball in the corridor around off, Masakadza was drawn into the forward defensive, the ball takes the edge and goes low to Dhoni, who doesn't make any mistake. H Masakadza c Dhoni b D Kulkarni 14(21) [4s-2]D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:8.3 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, steps out to this back of a length delivery, didn't have the room to free his arms, ends up tapping it towards cover-point
ZIMBABWE:8.2 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, back of a length on off, Masakadza twirls his wrists to flick, gets it high on the bat and the ball drops well in front of the mid-on fielder
ZIMBABWE:8.1 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, FOUR, poor delivery that has been dealt with. Masakadza getting a move on for Zimbabwe. Full and on the pads, Masakadza leans forward to play the pick up shot, slots it over mid-wicket to collect his second boundary
ZIMBABWE:7.6 Barinder to H Masakadza, 3 runs, Rayudu saved three early in the over and now concedes three. Fullish and just outside off, Masakadza drives it hard and straight to mid-off, Rayudu gets a bad bounce and he allows the ball to escape
ZIMBABWE:7.5 Barinder to H Masakadza, no run, huge shout for LBW. Tiffin is not moving. Inswinging yorker and Masakadza is beaten for sheer pace, is hit on the boot and goes to ground. The ball was doing too much and would have missed leg-stump. Top delivery though from Sran!
ZIMBABWE:7.4 Barinder to H Masakadza, FOUR, there's the first boundary of the innings. Took Zimbabwe eight overs to get it. Short and at the body, Masakadza doesn't bother to rock back, pulls it off the front foot over square leg
ZIMBABWE:7.3 Barinder to H Masakadza, no run, loose shot from the experienced man. Good length ball just outside off, Masakadza goes for the on the up drive, the ball swings in to beat the inside edge. Was never in position to play that shot

ZIMBABWE:6.5 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, another LBW shout turned down. A shimmy down might have just saved Masakadza there. He shuffled across to aim a flick to the on-side, misses and is struck in line with the stumps. The ball had a fair distance to travel and hence the umpire ruled it in favour of the batsman
ZIMBABWE:6.4 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, pitched up and asking the batsman to drive, Masakadza is not backing away, goes for it and picks out the fielder at mid-off
ZIMBABWE:6.3 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, fuller and attacking the stumps, Masakadza leans forward and whips it to mid-on, plenty of wrist in that shot
ZIMBABWE:6.2 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, drags the length back and Masakadza is more comfortable with this length, stays back and taps it in front of square on the off-side
ZIMBABWE:6.1 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, full and zips away around off, it was in the channel of uncertainty. Masakadza was committed to the drive, goes for it and did well not to nick it behind. More frustration for Dhawal
ZIMBABWE:5.6 Barinder to H Masakadza, 1 run, short of length close to off, Masakadza mistimes the punch towards mid-off, that allowed him to sprint across to the other end as the ball was slightly wide of Rayudu
ZIMBABWE:5.5 Barinder to H Masakadza, no run, back of a length around off, Masakadza stands tall and blocks it to mid-off
ZIMBABWE:5.4 Barinder to H Masakadza, no run, Masakadza has missed out there. Short and plenty of width outside off, Masakadza flashes a cut and is beaten on the outside edge. Didn't move his feet and hence couldn't reach the ball
ZIMBABWE:5.3 Barinder to Chibhabha, 1 run, the line and length remain the same as the previous delivery, but this time Chibhabha gets bat on the tuck and works it wide of Rahul at leg slip
ZIMBABWE:5.2 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, short of length on middle and leg, Chibhabha shuffles across and wears it on the thigh pad, the ball lobs up towards leg slip
ZIMBABWE:5.1 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, already signs of uneven bounce. Trifle short and outside off, Chibhabha goes for the cut, the ball doesn't bounce as much as he expected, it goes underneath his bat
ZIMBABWE:4.6 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, 1 run, back of a length on the hips, tucked away in front of square on the leg-side, for a single
ZIMBABWE:4.5 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, Chibhabha is not getting his timing right. Goes for the drive and gets it off the inner part of the bat towards mid-on

ZIMBABWE:3.6 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, back of a length on the pads, fails to tuck it away after walking down the pitch. The ball hits the thigh pad and rolls to the on-side
ZIMBABWE:3.5 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, that has missed off-stump by a whisker. Chibhabha is getting a testing over from Sran. Very full and the late inswing are causing the problems for Chibhabha, he gets an inside edge on the flick. The ball hits the boot and rolls back, almost kissed the off-pole
ZIMBABWE:3.4 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, Chibhabha keeps moving down the wicket, but can't seem to connect with any one of the flicks. Misses again and the ball rolls off the pad to square leg
ZIMBABWE:3.4 Barinder to Chibhabha, wide, darts it well outside off, Chibhabha is not going to play at that, second wide for the over
ZIMBABWE:3.3 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, shortish and outside off, angled across the right-hander, left aloneA leg slip has been added...
ZIMBABWE:3.2 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, Chibhabha steps out again to counter the swing. Sran is clever enough, he pulls his length back as well and gets it to nip back, Chibhabha almost falls over on the flick, ekes out an inside edge onto the pad
ZIMBABWE:3.2 Barinder to Chibhabha, wide, walks down the wicket and Sran shortens his length, gets his line wrong though. Just outside leg-stump and Chibhabha misses the flick. Another extra added to the total
ZIMBABWE:3.1 Barinder to H Masakadza, 1 run, good length ball homing in on the stumps, Masakadza is much more experienced than Moor, keeps his bat and pad close and turns it through the vacant mid-wicket region
ZIMBABWE:2.6 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, fullish and outside off, another one of Chibhabha's drives finds Jadhav at mid-off
ZIMBABWE:2.5 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, much better. But a bit fuller will be even better. In between good and short length, Chibhabha is not sure whether to go back or forward, just hangs his bat and is beaten. Makes a late move to bring his bat inside the line, but that was after the ball had passed the edge
ZIMBABWE:2.4 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, pitched up outside off, Chibhabha presents the full face of the bat and drives to mid-off, timed it well but straight to the fielder
ZIMBABWE:2.3 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, 2 runs, back of a length close to off, Chibhabha gets nicely on top of the bounce and punches it through extra cover, Jadhav runs back from mid-off and keeps it to a couple
ZIMBABWE:2.3 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, wide, it looks like Dhawal is trying a bit too much. Sprays this down leg, miles down, Chibhabha watches it go past him and Dhoni moves to his left to glove that
ZIMBABWE:2.2 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, shortish and around off, Chibhabha hops and tucks it in front of mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:2.1 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, fuller and outside off, Chibhabha mistimes the drive back to Dhawal. Closed the bat face and hence hit it down the wicket rather towards coverHamilton Masakadza, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:1.6 Barinder to Peter Moor, out Lbw!! Finally, Sran has a wicket to his name. He should have had both the openers. Nevertheless, it is an early breakthrough for India. Very similar to the one Chibhabha survived off the first ball. The length was a bit shorter and it nipped back in, Moor is not fast enough to get his bat down and is hit on the kneeroll. The impact was around off and middle. Sran's polite appeal was answered by the raise of the finger from Tiffin. Peter Moor lbw b Barinder 3(5)Barinder to Peter Moor, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
ZIMBABWE:1.5 Barinder to Peter Moor, no run, stifled appeal for caught behind. Another one down leg, Moor fails to lay bat on the glance. The ball kisses the trouser on the way to Dhoni. Much easier call for Tiffin
ZIMBABWE:1.4 Barinder to Peter Moor, no run, on a length and around off, Moor presses forward and taps it to cover
ZIMBABWE:1.3 Barinder to Chibhabha, leg byes, 1 run, Chibhabha tries to put Sran off by shuffling across and down the wicket, misses the flick and the ball goes off the thigh pad to the left of Dhoni

ZIMBABWE:1.2 Barinder to Chibhabha, wide, sprays this down leg and Chibhabha has nothing to do with it. Dhoni has a bit of stretching to do
ZIMBABWE:1.1 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, big shout for LBW and umpire Tiffin stays unmoved. That looks dead on the replay. Chibhabha is lucky to be out there. Full and tails back in late, Chibhabha falls over and is late to bring his bat down. Struck low on the boot and the HawkEye shows it to be hitting middle-stumpSran to have a crack with the second new ball.. He too has a couple of slips in place...Barinder Sran, comes into the attack
ZIMBABWE:0.6 D Kulkarni to Peter Moor, 2 runs, in the air and over the infield. Fullish and enticing the batsman to drive, Moor goes for it without much feet movement and ends up scooping it over cover-point another couple of runs added to the total
ZIMBABWE:0.5 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, 3 runs, short and plenty of width offered outside off, Chibhabha slaps it right off the toe-end to the right of backward point, Axar gives chase and hauls it in just before the rope, a run saved
ZIMBABWE:0.4 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, Dhawal has gone short after the first delivery. Chibhabha has ample time to cover for the swing and defend it to cover off the back foot
ZIMBABWE:0.3 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, back of a length on off, Chibhabha gets behind the line and blocks it in front of mid-on
ZIMBABWE:0.2 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, shortens the length and gets it to nip away outside off, Chibhabha as his partner goes fishing at one which he could have left, beaten all ends up. Nice carry through to MS DhoniNow a gully has been added...
ZIMBABWE:0.1 D Kulkarni to Peter Moor, 1 run, straightaway some movement for Dhawal. Keeps it full and gets the ball to shape away outside off, Moor has a feel for it away from the body, the thickish outside edge goes down to third manPeter Moor and Chibhabha are at the crease. Peter Moor is on strike. D Kulkarni will open the attackThe players line-up for their respective national anthems. First, it was India's followed by Zimbabwe's. Lance Klusener and Ntini are seen on the dressing room balcony, the former is the assistant coach of Zimbabwe. Dhoni has his men in a huddle as the umpires walk out to the middle. Masakadza or Sibanda at the top for the hosts. It is the pair of Peter Moor and Chamu Chibhabha, with the former marking his guard. Dhawal has the new nut. Two slips in place and the umpire calls "Play"...Teams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Hamilton Masakadza, Chamu Chibhabha, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Vusi Sibanda, Craig Ervine, Sikandar Raza, Peter Moor, Elton Chigumbura, Graeme Cremer(c), Taurai Muzarabani, Tendai ChataraIndia (Playing XI): Lokesh Rahul, Manish Pandey, Karun Nair, Ambati Rayudu, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni(w/c), Axar Patel, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jasprit Bumrah, Barinder Sran, Yuzvendra ChahalGraeme Cremer: "We would have bowled first as well. We know the Harare Sports Club, it will swing for the first 10 overs. We are all excited. We had a camp at Bulawayo and the guys are hungry to play."MS Dhoni: "We will bowl first. It is an early morning start. The temperature is cool and the bowlers will get help. The wicket gets better as the game progresses. I don't think there is a lot of grass. A good start is something that is important. It is like the end of the season for us; it is just after the IPL. We have made the most of the couple of practice sessions. We had a lot of T20s and we are not playing a lot of ODIs. So, we have to make the most of the games we play."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: "The outfield is lush. There is a bit of moisture because of the early start. For the first 30 minutes, there will be some seam movement. The pitch is hard and well rolled, apart from the first 30 minutes, it is an outstanding wicket," reckons Pat Symcox.- India last played an ODI against Zimbabwe on 14 July 2015. Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav and Axar Patel are the only players in India's current squad from that match.- MS Dhoni last played an ODI in Zimbabwe on 6 Sep 2005. Five Zimbabwean players from the current squad had made their ODI debut by then - Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura, Sean Williams, Tawanda Mupariwa & Chamu Chibhabha.- Elton Chigumbura would become the third player from Zimbabwe to play 200 ODIs after the Flower brothers. It will be his 197th ODI for Zimbabwe in addition to three for Africa XI.- Hamilton Masakadza has played 13 ODIs against India - the most between the two nations from the current squads against either sides.- Ambati Rayudu needs 48 more runs to reach 1000 runs in ODIs. His average of 45.33 is only behind Virat Kohli (51.51) and MS Dhoni (50.83).- Harare Sports Club has hosted 126 ODIs, none being played under lights. Sharjah Cricket Stadium has hosted the next most number of day matches - 124.We are almost close to toss time and as has been the norm, our stats guy Deepu Narayanan has a few numbers for everyone.Coming to Zimbabwe, they have had their fair share of issues coming into this series. They recently sacked head coach Dav Whatmore and made Makhaya Ntini as the interim coach. They have lost their last three series in ODIs to Afghanistan and Bangladesh respectively. Graeme Cremer has taken over the captaincy and it will be a test for him. However, he will have seniors Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura and Sean Williams to help him out. He will need them to play leading roles on the field, if Zimbabwe have to get something out of this series.There will be a few debutants for India. The opening pair of probably KL Rahul and Faiz Fazal be playing their first ODIs. In fact, there is news coming in that India has three debutants - KL Rahul, Karun Nair and Yuzvendra Chahal getting their respective caps from MS Dhoni. So, Faiz Fazal will have to wait some more time for his first game. The bowling department will be headed by Jasprit Bumrah and Dhawal Kulkarni. Even on paper the second string Indian unit looks strong.The T20 season is over. The Indian cricket team is back in action. First stop to start a busy schedule is Zimbabwe. As expected, some of the big names in the Indian team have been rested, apart from one - MS Dhoni. The skipper will lead a side of rookies, if we can call them that, with all the experiences gained playing in the Indian Premier League. Plenty of opportunities at stake and it will be interesting to see who grabs them.Preview by Prakash Govindasreenivasan After a disappointing ICC World T20 campaign, where Zimbabwe failed to reach the Super 10 stage, the home series against India gives them a chance to start afresh in their quest to regain the ground they've lost through poor performances in the last 12 to 15 months. Up against a team that is well and truly on the other end of the spectrum, the task looks herculean.Zimbabwe last played One-Day Internationals (ODIs) in December 2015-January 2016, when lost 2-3 to Afghanistan in Sharjah. Less than 12 months ago, another Indian side filled with non-regulars arrived in Zimbabwe and clinched the ODI series 3-0. Despite lining up a full-strength squad against India's second-string outfit, it will take a lot of effort for the Graeme Cremer-led side to upstage the visitors.As for India, MS Dhoni brings with him a bunch of tyros, who will get the opportunity to prove that they belong to the big stage. Rookies they may be, but more than two-thirds of the squad comes in right after a competitive season of the Indian Premier League and could prove to be a handful for the hosts. The beauty of a series opener is that it allows two sides, irrespective of their qualities and skill level, to begin with blank slates. If Zimbabwe manage to exploit the lack of experience in the opposition camp, an engaging series could be on the cards.When: June 11 at 09:00 AM Local Time, 12:30 PM ISTWhere: Harare Sports Club, HarareWhat to expect: A pleasant day with plenty of sunshine and a maximum of 23 degrees Celsius.Team newsIndia: Amidst the tyros and the IPL performers, Faiz Fazal stands out. The 30-year-old left-hander, who wasn't part of IPL 2016, has been one of Vidarbha's most consistent performers with the bat over the years and has waited patiently for his opportunity. With senior pros granted rest, Fazal could finally get to pull on the Indian jersey and slot into Shikhar Dhawan's opening position, alongside KL Rahul. In tough batting conditions, a lot will revolve around the middle-order core of Manish Pandey, Ambati Rayudu and Karun Nair, who will be raring to leave an indelible mark if he is handed his ODI debut on Saturday (June 11). MS Dhoni should be the rock in the middle, guiding his young team to play to expectations.With the likes of Elton Chigumbura and Chamu Chibhabha leading Zimbabwe's batting attack, the starts provided by Jasprit Bumrah and Jaydev Unadkat will go a long way in shaping the result as well as their futures in the 50-over format of the game. While Bumrah comes in after having established his credentials in T20Is, Unadkat faces the tough challenge of proving his mettle. The Saurashtra pacer, who returned from a long injury lay-off, enjoyed a good Ranji trophy season wherein he picked up 20 wickets in the first two fixtures.There could be a sense of friendly competitive spirit between Unadkat and Barinder Sran, who made his India debut in Australia last year and proved to be a vital member of the IPL 2016-winning Sunrisers Hyderabad squad. The series could also come as a stepping stone for Yuzvendra Chahal, the leg-spinner who has been one of Royal Challengers Bangalore's most prized assets for two seasons in a row. He will fight for the spinner's spot along with newbie Jayant Yadav and Axar Patel.Zimbabwe: The think-tank took severe measures to address the team's recent failure at the World T20. Dav Whatmore and Hamilton Masakadza, captain and coach of the side, paid the price for the ignominy of Zimbabwe being the only full member of ICC not qualifying for the Super 10s in the showpiece event in India. While bowling coach Makhaya Ntini takes over on a temporary basis, Greame Cremer has been named the interim skipper. Zimbabwe will miss the services of Tinashe Panyangara, the fast bowler, but, in Taurai Muzarabani, they have an able replacement.Sanjay Bangar, the Indian coach for the tour, acknowledged that his team need to adjust quickly to the conditions. The track in Harare is a tough one to bat on and the hosts will rely on their bowling attack to stifle a line-up that hasn't got too much international experience under its belt. Medium pacers Donald Tiripano and Neville Madziva will hold the aces early on. With Tendai Chisoro and Cremer assuming the duties of spinners, it remains to be seen if Wellington Masakadza, the young leg spinner who picked up four wickets against Scotland in the World T20 qualifier, gets a chance early in the series.Did you know?

Five Zimbabwean players from the current squad had made their ODI debut by then - Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura, Sean Williams, Tawanda Mupariwa & Chamu Chibhabha.Elton Chigumbura would become the third player from Zimbabwe to play 200 ODIs after the Flower brothers.
