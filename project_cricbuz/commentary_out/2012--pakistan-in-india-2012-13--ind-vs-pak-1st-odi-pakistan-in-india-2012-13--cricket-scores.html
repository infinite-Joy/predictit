Nips back in and catches Azhar Ali on the crease, rapped on the pads and that would have crashed into off and middle. Bowden thought it was high and that's why he didn't give it out. That should have been 2 in 2. Dhoni jokingly signals for the DRS. What irony!Azhar Ali, right handed bat, comes to the creaseHafeez made the mistake of not covering his off stump and shouldered arms. To his horror it cannoned into the off stump. Can't quite remember an Indian bowler taking a wicket with his first delivery on debut in ODIs.
PAKISTAN:0.1  Bhuvneshwar to Hafeez, out Bowled!! What a start! Dream debut ball for Bhuvneshwar. Similar delivery to the one that got Umar Akmal in the T20I.

Hafeez b Bhuvneshwar 0(1) Bhuvneshwar to Hafeez, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Hafeez and Nasir Jamshed are at the crease. Hafeez is on strike. Bhuvneshwar will open the attackAfter that taxing innings, Mahendra Singh Dhoni is out on the field giving his team a pep talk. What a man! What fitness! Meanwhile Bhuvneshwar Kumar on debut has the new ball. Two slips in place for the debutant.Some amazing fitness from Mahendra Singh Dhoni on show as well, he was struggling, seemingly in pain but willed his way against the odds. That's a captain's innings if ever there was one for you. Coming to Pakistan, how they will rue that dropped chance of MS when he was on 16 by Misbah. MS has surely made them pay for it. Could well turn out to be a match losing drop. We will know when the Pak team come out for the chase in a short while. Mind you it won't be easy to chase on this wicket. Do join us for the chase in a bit.A standing ovation from the Indian team for MS Dhoni as he walks off the field. Everyone including the support staff applaud the man and he deserves every inch of their appreciation. One must say that this has to be one of the greatest ODI innings of all time considering the score; India were 29/5 at one stage against a rampant Pak attack and also to battle the heat and humidity of Chennai. Dhoni never gave up and kept pushing himself on. Along with Raina initially and then with Ashwin later on, he has given India a great score to defend on this wicket.4
INDIA:49.6  Junaid Khan to Dhoni, 2 runs, yorker on the stumps, dug out softly near backward square and Dhoni will come back for the 2nd. That's just too good from the Indian skipper. India end on 227 which is a tremendous score after the initial setbacks
INDIA:49.5  Junaid Khan to Dhoni, FOUR, great batting from Dhoni! Knows Junaid Khan will bowl full, so just opens the face of the bat and scoops it over point. Wanted to get it over the man and does so. Junaid can't quite believe it

INDIA:5.4  Junaid Khan to Virat Kohli, out Bowled!! Unbelievable fast bowling! Amazing stuff from a pumped up Junaid Khan. Similar delivery to the one that got Sehwag out, nothing much that Virat Kohli could have done, maybe he should have looked to defend instead of attempting an ambitious drive, the ball missed the inside edge and struck off stump.

INDIA:4.6  Mohammad Irfan to Yuvraj, 2 runs, on off stump, Yuvraj flicks it past square leg for a couple of runs to get off the markThere are three slips in place now for Mohammad Irfan against Yuvraj
INDIA:4.5  Mohammad Irfan to Yuvraj, no run, short of length on off stump, Yuvraj hops back and defendsYuvraj Singh, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:4.4  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, out Bowled!! This is fast bowling of the highest order. Just like Junaid who set up Sehwag, here Irfan does the same and gets Gambhir out. The previous three were all outside off and bouncing, this one is full and on middle stump with a hint of inward movement, Gambhir's feet are late in getting forward and though he tries to cover the line, the ball has gone past the bat to crash into the stumps. The crowd can't quite believe it. Gambhir b Mohammad Irfan 8(17) [4s-1] Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Replays show that Sehwag was on the move when he tried to drive. Looked very awkward.
INDIA:4.3  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, bouncing outside off and Mohammad Irfan is keeping it there, Gambhir is happy to let it go
INDIA:4.2  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, still further away from outside off, an easy leave for Gambhir
INDIA:4.1  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, short of length outside off, bouncing too, Gambhir leaves
INDIA:3.6  Junaid Khan to Virat Kohli, no run, gets a good one from Junaid Khan, but Virat Kohli sees that outside off delivery and leaves. Testing stuff from JunaidVirat Kohli, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:3.5  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, out Bowled!! Knocked him over! Terrific bowling from Junaid Khan. He kept on working Sehwag over and finally nailed him. No feet, absolutely cemented to the crease, it swung in and went right through the bat and pad gap of Sehwag who was looking to drive. An SUV could've gone through that gap. Dreadful batting from Sehwag who didn't even make an attempt to cover the line. Sehwag b Junaid Khan 4(11) [4s-1] Junaid Khan to Sehwag, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:3.4  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, no run, loud shout for LBW, but that was going well over the stumps. Nipped back in and Sehwag's bat was nowhere in line, looked very awkward that time
INDIA:3.3  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, no run, uncertain from Sehwag again. He wanted to leave that, is in two minds and as he was leaving, the ball took the inside edge and nearly rolled onto the off stump
INDIA:3.2  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, no run, full on off stump, Sehwag drives with an open face and finds point
INDIA:3.1  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, no run, tight delivery on off stump, Sehwag defends it to point
INDIA:2.6  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, Gambhir wanted to leave that, as he was doing so the ball took the outer half of the bat and rolled to slip. Another good over from Mohammad Irfan comes to an end
INDIA:2.5  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, FOUR, edgy and just wide of Younis Khan at 2nd slip. Too close to be playing the cut shot which Gambhir did, it went in the air and just wide of YK's two hands. Gambhir living dangerously
INDIA:2.4  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, beautiful delivery. Angled in and then seamed away past the outside edge of Gambhir who was desperately trying to play inside the line. Mohammad Irfan follows through aggressively
INDIA:2.3  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, 2 runs, sliding on, on the middle stump, Gambhir works it wide of mid wicket for another couple
INDIA:2.2  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, 2 runs, Gambhir is off the mark with a square drive which was in the air, but in the gap as wellNow bright sunshine at Chennai.
INDIA:2.1  Mohammad Irfan to Sehwag, leg byes, 1 run, attempted yorker, but slides down leg, Sehwag isn't getting those deliveries away, so misses, off the toe and down to fine leg
INDIA:1.6  Junaid Khan to Gambhir, no run, good bowling. Pitches on middle, straightens, Gambhir plays a bit early and the leading edge almost carries to cover. Testing times for the Indian openers
INDIA:1.5  Junaid Khan to Gambhir, no run, now Gambhir plays well outside the line in trying to drive and misses a cover drive. The ball was well outside off and Gambhir's feet were nowhere in the picture. Lucky not to get an edge
INDIA:1.4  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, leg byes, 1 run, back to the inswinger, but again on the pads and once more Sehwag can't get any bat on the flick. A leg-bye to the total
INDIA:1.3  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, no run, beaten! He had been bringing the ball back in this over, slants this away and it goes with the angle, Sehwag pushes and misses
INDIA:1.2  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, FOUR, a gift for Sehwag althought it swung in, wrong line; on the pads and Sehwag just flicked it over mid wicket. First boundary for the Delhi manSehwag isn't happy with someone behind the bowlers arm. He wants that man to move which is causing the delay
INDIA:1.1  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, leg byes, 2 runs, again down leg-side and it goes off the pad - so a couple of leg-byesFreehit coming up
INDIA:1.1  Junaid Khan to Sehwag, no ball, rapped on the pads and Junaid Khan thought he had his man, but turned around to see Bowden's arms outstretched. It pitched outside leg and would've missed leg too as Sehwag was late in bringing his bat down and the ball thudded into his padsJunaid Khan, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:0.6  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, a good tight maiden over to start from Mohammad Irfan, no room for Gambhir to work with who defends cautiously
INDIA:0.5  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, good bowling, tight delivery on off stump, Gambhir defends it to short cover and looks for a quick single, Sehwag isn't interested
INDIA:0.4  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, in the corridor of uncertainty, nice fuller length too, left alone
INDIA:0.3  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, short of length and rising on the stumps, Gambhir hops back and defends it down the wicketA gully is in place as well. This is the first day game for India at home in two years. Also the first time that they are playing an ODI with the revised rules. Will be interesting to see how they go about dealing with those rules.
INDIA:0.2  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, good away swinger, pitches outside off and moves away, Gambhir shoulders arms
INDIA:0.1  Mohammad Irfan to Gambhir, no run, that's a steepler. Lifted off a short of length area and Gambhir sparred at it, but since it was outside off - no damage done. Mohammad Irfan should extract some serious bounce and movement from this surfaceGambhir and Sehwag are at the crease. Gambhir is on strike. Mohammad Irfan will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. The sun is out and it looks like we should have a full game. Sehwag and Gambhir are the Indian openers. The latter will be on strike to the giant Irfan. Two slips in place for him. Here we go.So lots of good tributes pouring in for the late Tony Greig. Keep them coming. Will try to post as many as I can.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Nasir Jamshed, Mohammad Hafeez, Azhar Ali, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal(w), Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Mohammad IrfanIndia (Playing XI): Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ashok Dinda, Ishant SharmaDhoni: 'Definitely there will be something for the fast bowlers, we were looking to field first. The game is changing, we are playing with new rules and the format is very demanding. We haven't got a clue what a good score is. One thing is to keep wickets in hand as we have explosive players later on who can capitalise. Sehwag replaces Rahane - that's the only change from the T20I team.'Misbah: 'From the last two days it has been raining and the covers have been on, so we want to utilise the moisture underneath. We are satisfied with the players we have. Our goal is to play good cricket and the team showed it in the T20I series. Azhar Ali, Younis Khan are back. Umar Akmal misses out, so does Sohail Tanvir - Junaid replaces him.'Pakistan have won the toss and elected to fieldAsifAliBaig: Sharjah 1998: Sachin plays a copybook straight drive for a six and Tony Greig says 'Straight down the ground, wonderful shot, all the way for a six, whatta playa'! Its sad that we wont get to either watch Sachin bat in an ODI again or Tony Greig providing with his sensational commentary! As Tony says, 'Its all over!'08:51 Local Time, 03:21 GMT, 08:51 IST: The umpires were out in the middle and had a word with the two captains. Billy Bowden says the toss will be at 9:30 and the match will begin at 10:00. S Ravi praises the groundstaff for the work they have done.08:32 Local Time, 03:02 GMT, 08:32 IST: The toss has been delayed and the umpires will have an inspection in 15 minutes time. There are three areas of concern on the outfield and that's why the toss has been delayed.Pitch report: There was rain yesterday so there will be moisture on it. Little more grass than normal on the wicket. 'I have played in Chennai and have never seen grass like this before', says Wasim Akram. The batting side have to see off the early period to get runs on this pitch. Fielding first is the way to go according to Ravi Shastri.For Pakistan it will be Misbah who will captain - remember he is still the ODI captain and not Hafeez. For India Sehwag is back at the top of the order. Should be interesting to see what lineups both teams go withAfter a cracking T20I series which involved two nail-biting games, we move on to the ODI series which starts today at Chennai. India Pakistan is always a big game irrespective of the format and today will be no different. There were some concerns about the weather playing spoilsport but it looks sunny at the moment. Do stay tuned for the toss and the teamsPreview by Gokul GopalA well-fought T20I series ended with equal honours and both India and Pakistan will be at it again, trying to out-smart each other in the three-match ODI series that begins in Chennai. The year has not been all that good for India, who will be looking to finish off 2012 on a high while Pakistan will be hoping to end the year with their second win against India. (India won the Asia Cup ODI and were victorious in the World T20 match against Pakistan while the recently concluded T20I series was a 1-1 finish)Weather:Going by what happened in the T20I series, the one-dayers also promise a lot of exhilarating action. However, weather remains the biggest concern for the opening ODI as it has been raining continuously for two days in Chennai. With showers being predicted for the match day and the overnight rain not leaving much for the ground to dry, a complete wash-out may not be ruled out.India:India have a few positives to take from the 2-match T20I series. Gautam Gambhir looked woefully out of touch in the Test series against England, but he has slowly been regaining some touch. While the left-hander took some time to get his eye in the opening T20I against Pakistan, he did settle down and has been looking quite assured with his batting. Ajinkya Rahane, who showed some spunk in the T20I series, is likely to be competing for a spot in the middle order with the arrival of Virender Sehwag to the ODI fold. Sehwag's presence is always a challenging proposition for the opposition and an explosive batsman of the calibre of Sehwag being in the team is always a big boost for India in any format of the game. Virat Kohli, at number three, has not quite produced the runs against Pakistan in the matches so far, but the quality player that he is, India will be expecting substantial contributions from him during the ODIs. Another player contesting for a spot in the middle order is Rohit Sharma. Although he has not done much justice to the immense talent he possesses, Rohit, who will be contesting for a spot with Rahane and possibly with Ravindra Jadeja, will be eager to prove a point. Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Mahendra Singh Dhoni complete the middle order. Yuvraj has been in good touch with the bat and the blistering knock that he produced in the last game, will give the left-handed all-rounder a lot of confidence. Dhoni too has been batting well recently and is a key member of the middle order.Coming to India's bowling, Ishant Sharma will be the leader of the pace attack that also has Ashok Dinda and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who in all likelihood will make his ODI debut after a dream start to his international career with a 3/9 in the opening T20 match. Although he was left out of both the T20s, R Ashwin is still the main spinner in the Indian line-up. Yuvraj and Jadeja are also useful left-arm spinners while Amit Mishra, with his leg-spin, lends variety. The question to be asked is, what kind of attack will Dhoni opt for and will they be disciplined enough to restrict the Pakistani batsmen?PakistanThe visitors also have a pretty solid batting line-up, capable of posting or chasing down big totals, although they have been lacking on the consistency level. Mohammad Hafeez, who came up a brilliant knock at Ahmedabad, although in a losing cause, is a reliable opening batsmen. However, it is to be seen if he will open or come in at number three like he did in the T20Is. Nasir Jamshed is also someone who can be counted upon at the top of the order while Pakistan also have the option of Imran Farhat. ODI captain Misbah-ul-Haq returns to boost the side in the middle order while the presence of Younis Khan is an added advantage, despite the latter not having seen much action of late. Azhar Ali, who is equally adept at opening the innings and batting in the middle order, is a good addition to the side. Shoaib Malik, after a terrific performance in Bangalore, has been included in the ODI squad and will have a key role to play, if selected in the eleven. To round up the middle order, Pakistan have the Akmal brothers, who are capable of being match-winners.More than batting, Pakistan consider their bowling to be their most important weapon said Hafeez before the start of the India series. The presence of world-class bowlers such as Umar Gul and Saeed Ajmal supports Hafeez' claim, who himself is more than a useful off-spinner, apart from being a fine batsman. Wahab Riaz and Junaid Khan, quality left-arm seamers, are also in the line-up while Pakistan decided to include the 7-feet tall left-arm pacer Mohammad Irfan for the ODIs, after an impressive showing in the T20Is. Whoever makes it to the line-up, all Misbah will be asking for is a 100 percent effort on their part.Head to head: Pakistan have had a better run than the hosts in the 50-over matches played in India. In a total of 27 matches against India in India, Pakistan have won 17 while ending up on the losing side 10 times. In terms have series victories, Pakistan have three against their sub-continent rivals while India have managed 2 series wins in their backyard.Quotes:He is a bit different. You can say that he is about one foot different to some of our bowlers. He gets lot of bounce and bowls at decent pace. We have to watch out for him: MS Dhoni wants his batsmen to be wary of Mohammad Irfan.Teams:India (From): Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, MS Dhoni(w/c), Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ashok Dinda, Ishant Sharma, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Ajinkya Rahane, Amit Mishra, Shami AhmedPakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Nasir Jamshed, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal(w), Umar Akmal, Azhar Ali, Junaid Khan, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Gul, Mohammad Irfan, Zulfiqar Babar, Imran Farhat, Wahab Riaz, Anwar Ali, Haris Sohail, Younis KhanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
