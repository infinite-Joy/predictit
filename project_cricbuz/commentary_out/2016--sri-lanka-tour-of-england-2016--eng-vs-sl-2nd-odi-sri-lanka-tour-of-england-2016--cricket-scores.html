Hales played across the line to this very straight ball and if not for the wood (and the HotSpot for showing it to me), I thought that was out. A win for technology over my eyes, a rare win
ENGLAND:2.4 Maharoof to Hales, no run, now this has good bounce and could be punched on the up towards mid-on
ENGLAND:2.3 Maharoof to Hales, no run, the pace is off already. Well, who's surprised? Fullish cutter, Hales thinks of dabbing it late to third man but it underwhelms in bounce and beats the bat
ENGLAND:2.2 Maharoof to Hales, no run, back of a length delivery, looked too slow to threaten and Hales punched it back
ENGLAND:2.1 Maharoof to Hales, no run, full on a line more cramped than ever. Hales gets behind on front foot and blocksBlue skies..
ENGLAND:1.6 Lakmal to Jason Roy, 2 runs, this was a back of a length delivery angled in, Roy got up and helped it round the corner for a couple of runs
ENGLAND:1.5 Lakmal to Jason Roy, no run, pats a fullish ball with a horizontal bat to point
ENGLAND:1.4 Lakmal to Jason Roy, no run, fullish expectedly, too far outside off for even a colored-clothed Roy to flirt. Left alone
ENGLAND:1.3 Lakmal to Jason Roy, FOUR, now this has been crucnhed away. Is on the front foot, sees the width, stands taller and flashes it away through point
ENGLAND:1.2 Lakmal to Jason Roy, no run, too good a ball to be flirted to third man. Tries to execute a late cut wide of slip, there's swing and bounce to beat the top-edge of a cramped Roy
ENGLAND:1.1 Lakmal to Jason Roy, no run, just a hint of width on a length, Roy has the room to cut it away rather delicately. A diving save at point and it's not a boundary.. such a thin lineSuranga Lakmal, right-arm medium, comes into the attackA slip for Lakmal
ENGLAND:0.6 Maharoof to Hales, no run, length ball not rising up as anticipated, Hales is getting taller and then arrests it by snapping his feet together and blocking
ENGLAND:0.6 Maharoof to Hales, wide, sliding down leg and it's wide enough
ENGLAND:0.5 Maharoof to Jason Roy, 1 run, another one clipped to backward square leg
ENGLAND:0.4 Maharoof to Hales, 1 run, shaves it off his pads for a single to backward square leg
ENGLAND:0.3 Maharoof to Hales, FOUR, ah, wristy. Maharoof goes fuller in greed, attacks the pads and Hales shovels it away with a clip through mid-wicket
ENGLAND:0.2 Maharoof to Hales, no run, and again as the lone slipper looks over. Scissors in from a length, hits the thigh pad and there's a more voracious appeal but too limp to put a seed of doubt in the umpire's mind
ENGLAND:0.1 Maharoof to Jason Roy, 1 run, nips back from a short of length zone, Roy is almost opened up but it's higher than Wun Wun, the impact here. Flicks the shirt, I think, as Roy jabs his bottom hand offJason Roy and Hales are at the crease. Jason Roy is on strike. Maharoof will open the attackMaharoof to bowl with the keeper up...Welcome back. The script has almost been the same: Sri Lanka bat first, are held to a below par score, the world derides them while predicting a walking win for England. Is the script set to be repeated - because no one minds a tie - or there's more fuel in Sri Lanka than they promised in the first ODI?Sri Lanka have snuck up to 254, a fighting effort at best, thanks to Tharanga and Randiv's fight lower down. It could have been more, it could have been less but it's fallen somewhere in between mediocrity and timidity. Chandimal and Mathews put on a decent partnership in the middle to stabilize the innings from a shaky 77/3. But Adil Rashid's impressive control and persistence paved the way for another stutter as the leggie picked up 2 wickets in 2 overs. Sri Lanka lost 5 wickets in the space of 8 overs during that phase and that crippled all efforts of getting anywhere close to a par score on a cracking pitch. There's good bounce and carry, something which came to Plunkett's aid with the new ball as he steamed in to nip out both the openers. England shouldn't really be troubled by this, but then again, they shouldn't have been troubled the last time too. Can Sri Lanka make a fist out of it this time? Will England come out into the chase sleepwalking again? Join us in a while for all the answers...4
SRI LANKA:49.6 Woakes to Tharanga, byes, 1 run, pushed away from the left hander on a good length, Tharanga swings and misses. Again, the bounce. It's the last ball so they sneak in a bye aided by Woakes's wayward throw after being relayed the ball by Buttler
SRI LANKA:49.5 Woakes to Tharanga, 2 runs, low full toss outside off, Tharanga throws his hands at it and slices it over backward point. A tumbling effort from sweeper cover running across cuts off the boundary
SRI LANKA:49.4 Woakes to Randiv, 1 run, patted in front of Roy at backward point and Randiv just takes off blindly. He'd given up but there is no direct-hit
SRI LANKA:49.3 Woakes to Tharanga, 1 run, overpitched but Woakes has got the line wide enough, Tharanga reaches out on bent knees and smears it to sweeper cover
SRI LANKA:49.2 Woakes to Randiv, leg byes, 1 run, angled in on a back of a length to follow Randiv in his sojourn down leg, denies him a clean swing of the arms and deflects off the pads wide of backward point
SRI LANKA:49.1 Woakes to Tharanga, 1 run, fraction full outside off, driven down to long-off to bring up a half-century for Tharanga. He's ensured that Sri Lanka at least bat out these fifty overs..
SRI LANKA:48.6 Willey to Randiv, 2 runs, speared full and wide, skewed off the outside half of the bat and sliced over backward point. Longish boundary there and the batsmen decide to take on the arm of a fielder, do so successfully
SRI LANKA:48.5 Willey to Randiv, FOUR, Willey simply turns back with disgust. He's bowled a decent full ball which curls...swirls away with some tail to find the outside edge as Randiv swings for the rafters. Runs away to beat third man
SRI LANKA:48.4 Willey to Randiv, 2 runs, reaches out to meet a ball on the full and whips it past a diving mid-wicket. In between deep mid-wicket and long-on and a couple more
SRI LANKA:48.3 Willey to Randiv, 2 runs, overpitched outside off, Randiv beats mid-off with a mistimed drive but it doesn't have enough muscle behind it escape long-on. A brace
SRI LANKA:48.2 Willey to Tharanga, 1 run, speared very full on middle and leg, more like it, keeps Tharanga to a single through square leg
SRI LANKA:48.1 Willey to Tharanga, FOUR, loads up on the bottom hand and crashes it over extra-cover with a hefty swish. Too short from Willey and he doesn't have the pace really. Tharanga backs away a touch and gets a lot of meat
SRI LANKA:47.6 Woakes to Tharanga, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Tharanga slashes it off the front foot to deep cover
SRI LANKA:47.5 Woakes to Tharanga, no run, leaving Tharanga with the angle from a good length and the left-hander, who is inexplicably half-hearted in his attempted poke, is beaten on the edge
SRI LANKA:47.4 Woakes to Tharanga, 2 runs, fullish outside off and this time Tharanga slices it away over backward point. Two more. A bit of a dash for the visitors in these dying stages
SRI LANKA:47.3 Woakes to Tharanga, SIX, slower ball, sits up and hacked away to the deep mid-wicket boundary, all the way. Poor delivery really. Allowed Tharanga plenty of time to rock back and pummel the pull. Flat six
SRI LANKA:47.2 Woakes to Tharanga, no run, slinging into the blockhole on off, Tharanga chops it into the boots off an inside edge
SRI LANKA:47.1 Woakes to Randiv, 1 run, pitched right up, in the slot around off and Randiv has an almighty waft across the line, slices it off the outside half down to third manChris Woakes [6.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:46.6 Willey to Randiv, 1 run, low full toss on middle and leg, flicked through square leg
SRI LANKA:46.5 Willey to Randiv, 2 runs, charges down, creates his own width and flays it over backward point. Huge boundary on that side of the ground and the sweeper is a bit straight. Easy two
SRI LANKA:46.4 Willey to Randiv, FOUR, second boundary of the over with a cute little paddle from Randiv. He shuffles across off, picks a length ball and helps it on its way. Fine enough
SRI LANKA:46.3 Willey to Tharanga, 1 run, knocked wide of backward point this time, scampers to the other end
SRI LANKA:46.2 Willey to Tharanga, no run, back of a length outside off, chopped to backward point
SRI LANKA:46.1 Willey to Tharanga, FOUR, thick edge and it skips away into the third man fence. No slips which is understandable at this stage and Tharanga gets away with a loose drive away from the body. The length wasn't quite thereDavid Willey [8.0-0-38-1] is back into the attackAt a time when the innings should be taking off, Sri Lanka are crawling..
SRI LANKA:45.6 Plunkett to Randiv, no run, more confusion in the running and it's that man Roy again who is creating all sorts of chaos. No damage this time though as Randiv shouts a loud NO after his initial hesitation. Dabbed close enough of backward point and there was no single
SRI LANKA:45.5 Plunkett to Tharanga, 1 run, good angle this, not giving any width at all and the length hasn't been in Tharanga's half either. Glanced off the hips to fine leg
SRI LANKA:45.4 Plunkett to Tharanga, no run, back of a length, skidding on, Tharanga stays flat-footed and guides to point
SRI LANKA:45.3 Plunkett to Tharanga, no run, short of length delivery outside off, Tharanga steers it to point
SRI LANKA:45.2 Plunkett to Tharanga, no run, two sounds as Tharanga misses an attempted flick. Angled in on a good length from round the wicket, it sneaks past the inside edge, clips front pad and then back pad which causes the two noises. But it would have gone down leg anyway
SRI LANKA:45.1 Plunkett to Randiv, 1 run, at Randiv's ribs, he hops across and tucks it through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:44.6 Woakes to Tharanga, no run, short of length delivery tucking the batsman up
SRI LANKA:44.5 Woakes to Randiv, 1 run, what's that? Randiv is awkwardly shuffling across premeditatedly, picks a length ball and just flicks it in the air, lucky not to carry to the fielder
SRI LANKA:44.4 Woakes to Tharanga, 1 run, short ball just outside off, Tharanga fetches it from over his left shoulder and pulls it softly through square leg
SRI LANKA:44.3 Woakes to Randiv, 1 run, Bairstow in the action again as Randiv flicks one smoothly to deep mid-wicket, and more cheers from that section of the crowd..
SRI LANKA:44.2 Woakes to Tharanga, 1 run, back of a length and Tharanga has scythed it on the up through the covers. Oh, excellent work from Bairstow running across and diving in the deep to keep them to a single. Huge cheers from the crowd behind him, some of whom are in real high spirits and playing a few shenanigans...
SRI LANKA:44.1 Woakes to Tharanga, no run, shortish outside off, Tharanga slashes and misses. Extra bounce. It's been a cracking pitch with good, consistent bounceChris Woakes [5.0-0-17-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:43.6 Plunkett to Tharanga, 1 run, knocked wide of point off the front foot. Tharanga will keep strike...
SRI LANKA:43.5 Plunkett to Tharanga, FOUR, squared up from round the wicket, an outside edge and four. Cruel for Plunkett who gets the ball to hold its line from a back of a length, Tharanga is neither forward nor back and the movement foils his defence
SRI LANKA:43.4 Plunkett to Randiv, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off climbing on Randiv as he glides it in the air wide of third man
SRI LANKA:43.3 Plunkett to Randiv, no run, chipped in the air ... just short of mid-off. Randiv is a little too early on the push down the ground and he's playing on the up as well. Never in control but his bat-speed at the point of impact isn't great to carry the ball to the fielder
SRI LANKA:43.2 Plunkett to Randiv, no run, lifting over Randiv's head as he crouches hurriedly again
SRI LANKA:43.1 Plunkett to Randiv, no run, bouncer in line with the stumps, ducked
SRI LANKA:42.6 Willey to Tharanga, no run, back of a length, middle and leg, tucked to mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:42.5 Willey to Tharanga, no run, back of a length outside off, Tharanga pushes off the back foot to cover
SRI LANKA:42.4 Willey to Randiv, 1 run, slower ball, 73mph, clipped off the pads wide of mid-on
SRI LANKA:42.3 Willey to Tharanga, 1 run, rising short ball around off, Tharanga is quickly into his swivel and rolls his wrists on the pull through square leg
SRI LANKA:42.2 Willey to Randiv, 1 run, waits a little more on a similar length ball and guides it squarer - through the cover-point region
SRI LANKA:42.1 Willey to Randiv, no run, length ball outside off, patted in front of cover. Tharanga denies the run
SRI LANKA:41.6 Plunkett to Randiv, 1 run, Randiv not much of an expansive pusher from the looks of it. More in the Ishant Sharma mould. A little nurdle here and there, this time wide of cover for a single
SRI LANKA:41.5 Plunkett to Tharanga, 1 run, hops away from the line of the ball to stay leg-side of it and stabs a single in front of pointRound the wicket...
SRI LANKA:41.4 Plunkett to Randiv, leg byes, 1 run, doesn't quite come on from a short of length, holds on Randiv and deflects off his thigh into the on-side
SRI LANKA:41.3 Plunkett to Randiv, no run, pitched up outside off, an insipid Randiv pushes to cover
SRI LANKA:41.2 Plunkett to Randiv, no run, sharp bumper in line with the stumps, Randiv hunkers underneath
SRI LANKA:41.1 Plunkett to Tharanga, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, dabbed to third manLiam Plunkett [7.0-0-38-2] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:40.6 Willey to Randiv, no run, a little bit fuller, Randiv prods across to tap to short cover
SRI LANKA:40.5 Willey to Randiv, no run, length ball outside off, defended towards short coverSuraj Randiv, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:40.4 Willey to Maharoof, out Bowled!! Right through him! Just a little bit of nip back into the right-hander from a good length and Maharoof has played all around it. It's not done a great deal but enough to take the top of off. Sri Lanka are disintegrating. Maharoof b Willey 2(3)Willey to Maharoof, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
SRI LANKA:40.3 Willey to Maharoof, 2 runs, Maharoof is pushing forward to a straight ball but is playing slightly outside the line, skews away off the inside half behind the square leg umpire, the batsmen race back for two to beat fine leg's throw
SRI LANKA:40.2 Willey to Maharoof, no run, slanted across just outside off, defended to cover
SRI LANKA:40.1 Willey to Tharanga, 1 run, back of a length, fizzing off this hard deck and producing good bounce, pushed on the up through the coversDavid Willey [6.0-0-32-0] is back into the attackFarveez Maharoof, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:39.6 Moeen Ali to Chandimal, out Chandimal Run Out!! Another run-out and Sri Lanka sink further into darkness with their set batsman hobbling back. Huge mix-up after a ball is knocked into the on-side, Chandimal and Tharanga agree on the single at first before Tharanga sniffs trouble seeing Roy swooping in from mid-wicket and bails out. Chandimal had already reached the point of no return and all it took was a reasonable under-arm throw near the stumps to put an end to his vigil at the crease. Chandimal run out (Jason Roy/Buttler) 52(86) [4s-3]Moeen Ali to Chandimal, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
SRI LANKA:39.5 Moeen Ali to Chandimal, no run, slightly short with a bit of width on offer, Chandimal's late-cut finds backward point
SRI LANKA:39.4 Moeen Ali to Tharanga, 1 run, turned off the pads wide of short mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:39.3 Moeen Ali to Chandimal, 1 run, straight line, not a lot of turn, Chandimal rolls his wrists and knocks it into the leg-side
SRI LANKA:39.2 Moeen Ali to Tharanga, 1 run, skidding into middle and leg, clipped through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:39.1 Moeen Ali to Tharanga, FOUR, Ali overpitching and is punished by Tharanga. Scythed away through the covers with a big swish. He's been short of runs recently and could do with these gifts...Moeen Ali [8.0-0-34-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:38.6 Adil Rashid to Tharanga, 1 run, he had to be quick there, did Tharanga. Extra-cover was swooping in on the ball but couldn't break the stumps at the non-striker's end as the crowd gasped in unison. Would have been safe, just, I think. Rashid is done for the day. Another impressive outing for the leggie and he has created a massive stutter in the Lankan innings..
SRI LANKA:38.5 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, 1 run, pushed with the turn to sweeper cover
SRI LANKA:38.4 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, no run, not a lot of spin despite being slow through the air, Chandimal keeps it out
SRI LANKA:38.3 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, no run, looped up deliciously, overpitched on off, Chandimal kicks his front leg away and drills the drive straight to extra-cover
SRI LANKA:38.2 Adil Rashid to Tharanga, 1 run, an ugly googly which is hacked only as far as long-on, all along the turf. Rashid had dragged it well short and would have feared the worse
SRI LANKA:38.1 Adil Rashid to Tharanga, no run, flatter and sliding away from a back of a length outside off, dabbed to short third man
SRI LANKA:37.6 Root to Tharanga, 1 run, flatter on the pads, tucked behind square
SRI LANKA:37.5 Root to Tharanga, FOUR, another poor one, this time down leg and this time Tharanga doesn't miss out. Goes hard on the pull and gets a little tickle down to the fine leg fence
SRI LANKA:37.4 Root to Tharanga, no run, these should be put away but Tharanga has cut a half-tracker straight to point
SRI LANKA:37.3 Root to Chandimal, 1 run, now he gets to his fifty! An honest effort from the Lankan middle order batsman who's had to tone down his natural game for the situation. Clips it from off stump through mid-wicket, nothing grandiloquent about his celebration
SRI LANKA:37.2 Root to Chandimal, no run, very full ball around off, lots of air on the off-break, Chandimal squashes it to the right of Root who dives across to stop
SRI LANKA:37.1 Root to Tharanga, 1 run, sliding down leg, Tharanga helps it around the corner to get to the other endIt was a nice partnership between Chandimal and Mathews, but two back-to-back wickets haven't helped Sri Lanka's cause. Meanwhile, more hamstring trouble for Chandimal causing an extended break...
SRI LANKA:36.6 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, no run, shimmies down to a googly and tucks it with the turn to short mid-wicket who is intercepting Chandimal's eagerness well enough to cut the run. The milestone will have to wait until after this drinks break..Chandimal on 49...
SRI LANKA:36.5 Adil Rashid to Tharanga, 1 run, a little bit fuller this time means that Tharanga is able to smother it down to long-on
SRI LANKA:36.4 Adil Rashid to Tharanga, no run, turns back in to beat Tharanga's flick, deflects off the pad and into the hands of slip
SRI LANKA:36.3 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, 1 run, short this time, flat and turning away outside off, cut away through the covers
SRI LANKA:36.2 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, no run, lovely drift this. The rhythm is there for the leg-spinner. Swerves back in with the arm, pitches on middle and leg and Chandimal pays respect with a forward defence
SRI LANKA:36.1 Adil Rashid to Tharanga, 1 run, slow through the air, perfect length as the ball dips on the batsman, clipped down to long-on
SRI LANKA:35.6 Root to Chandimal, no run, nurdled into the on-side for nothing
SRI LANKA:35.5 Root to Tharanga, 1 run, lots of flight around off, driven down to long-off
SRI LANKA:35.4 Root to Tharanga, no run, slightly quicker through the air and there is pad involved as the ball snakes back in with the arm, but not before grazing the inside edge
SRI LANKA:35.3 Root to Chandimal, 1 run, prods across to off and nudges it with the turn through the on-side
SRI LANKA:35.2 Root to Tharanga, 1 run, drifting nicely into Tharanga, there's a slight risk playing across the line if there is turn. There isn't. Single through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:35.1 Root to Chandimal, 1 run, round the wicket, loops it on the pads, Chandimal clips it behind squareJoe Root [1.0-0-4-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:34.6 Adil Rashid to Tharanga, no run, jabbed into the covers with soft hands
SRI LANKA:34.5 Adil Rashid to Tharanga, no run, googly just outside off, smothered
SRI LANKA:34.4 Adil Rashid to Tharanga, no run, tight on middle, Tharanga fails to put bat to ball. A mild appeal but height was the issue
SRI LANKA:34.3 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, 1 run, chopped to backward point
SRI LANKA:34.2 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, no run, tossed up just outside off, pushed towards coverUpul Tharanga, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:34.1 Adil Rashid to S Prasanna, out Caught by Willey!! David Willey has plucked the catch of the season. Fantastic, absolutely top-class stuff from the Northampton lad, he rolls on the ground, hands-on-hips and stares at Alex Hales in utter disbelief. I'm sure he will show that to his grand children in the future. Coming to the dismissal: Prasanna took a stride forward and lofted this high into the blue skies - More elevation than distance. Willey from long-on covers a few acres of ground to his left and pounces like a Puma and snaffles it inches above the ground. S Prasanna c Willey b Adil Rashid 2(6)Adil Rashid to S Prasanna, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:33.6 Plunkett to S Prasanna, 1 run, would have been tight had mid-on hit that. Prasanna nudged this length ball towards him and ran off, only for the throw to be missed by a whisker - At non-striker's end
SRI LANKA:33.5 Plunkett to S Prasanna, no run, CTRL C + CTRL V of the last delivery
SRI LANKA:33.4 Plunkett to S Prasanna, no run, a big whoosh from Seekkuge Prasanna - Looks like England have a plan to this man - Keeping it short and wide, coupled with some extravagant bounce. Prasanna swipe slices thin air
SRI LANKA:33.3 Plunkett to Chandimal, 1 run, stays on the back foot and open-bats a back of a length to third man
SRI LANKA:33.2 Plunkett to S Prasanna, 1 run, jumps back and looks to flick it uppishly, the ball zips off the pitch and hits the splice. Not quite where he intended but he will take a single nonetheless
SRI LANKA:33.1 Plunkett to Chandimal, 1 run, worked into the deep mid-wicket pocketLiam Plunkett [6.0-0-34-2] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:32.6 Adil Rashid to S Prasanna, no run, aggro. right from ball one, Prasanna looks to spank the cut through the covers. But, it wasn't a leggie, a googly in fact which spins in and beats Prasanna neck and cropSeekkuge Prasanna, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:32.5 Adil Rashid to Mathews, out Caught by Plunkett!! Plunkett can't go wrong today, he just can't. Wonder what that last ball six would have done to his confidence, remember Mic Holding having a discussion around those lines - On how small moments can change a cricketer's career. Okay! Nuff said. Adil Rashid gets his reward for some consistent bowling - Slowed it up and lured Mathews to play across the line. The ball did dip and bounced a bit extra than Mathews anticipated. Skews the slog-sweep off the top-edge. In the air....who wants it? (Bumble-style) Plunkett puts his hand up as he runs back at backward square and swallows sans any fuss. Mathews c Plunkett b Adil Rashid 44(54) [4s-3]Adil Rashid to Mathews, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:32.4 Adil Rashid to Mathews, no run, a watchful forward defence from the skip.
SRI LANKA:32.3 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, 1 run, 47mph tempter, loopy just outside off, Chandimal does well to keep his eyes and drive through the line towards long-off
SRI LANKA:32.2 Adil Rashid to Mathews, 1 run, punched down to long-on
SRI LANKA:32.1 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, 1 run, cracked off the back foot to sweeper cover
SRI LANKA:31.6 Root to Chandimal, leg byes, 1 run, stifled appeal for leg before but it could have just ripped past that off-stump. Mic Holding reckons "It didn't spin enough." It surely didn't and height was an issue as replays confirm. Chandimal wanted to tuck this slower delivery around off, was a smidgen early on the shot and missed. Struck high but you know the rest...
SRI LANKA:31.5 Root to Mathews, 1 run, wristed through mid-wicketMathews pulled away after Root hurled the ball. Would have been a wide had he left that
SRI LANKA:31.4 Root to Mathews, no run, shortish and flat on middle, Mathews leans forward and dead-bats
SRI LANKA:31.3 Root to Chandimal, 1 run, make that two in a row
SRI LANKA:31.2 Root to Mathews, 1 run, plonks forward and drives a flatter delivery to long-off

SRI LANKA:30.5 Adil Rashid to Mathews, 1 run, tap-and-run, tip-and-run, a quick single in front of short cover. Are England being too lackadaisical?

SRI LANKA:30.3 Adil Rashid to Chandimal, no run, backs away a fraction and punches solidly to extra cover

SRI LANKA:29.6 Plunkett to Mathews, 1 run, hops and flicks one off his pads, a single to deep square
SRI LANKA:29.5 Plunkett to Mathews, no run, 83.1mph, at off-stump, Mathews closes the bat face on the drive, rolled away in front of mid-on
SRI LANKA:29.4 Plunkett to Mathews, 2 runs, pulled away neatly to deep mid-wicket, SL keep ticking
SRI LANKA:29.3 Plunkett to Chandimal, 1 run, stays back and stabs a shortish delivery to third man
SRI LANKA:29.2 Plunkett to Chandimal, FOUR, down the pitch and cross-bat smite through mid-wicket. The key was he predicted the length early and placed it in the gap, fair enough! No risky business from Dinesh
SRI LANKA:29.1 Plunkett to Mathews, 1 run, pacy back of a length delivery targetting the hip, Mathews was slightly hurried for the pace - Just manages to pull it one-handed, down to fine leg
SRI LANKA:28.6 Adil Rashid to Mathews, 1 run, chips the drive over a non-existent mid-on, easy single
SRI LANKA:28.5 Adil Rashid to Mathews, no run, lunges well forward and pushes a flat dart back to the bowler

SRI LANKA:28.2 Adil Rashid to Mathews, no run, tight outside off, belts the drive straight to cover
SRI LANKA:28.1 Adil Rashid to Mathews, no run, drifts in and then spins away on off, driven back
SRI LANKA:27.6 Plunkett to Chandimal, no run, driven dead-straight and Buttler appeals for an ambitious run out. Assuming Plunkett may have got some hand as he swooped low on his followthrough. Another day Jos, another day...
SRI LANKA:27.5 Plunkett to Chandimal, no run, chips the flick in front of short mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:27.4 Plunkett to Chandimal, no run, better lines from Plunkett, Chandimal could only play it tamely into the leg-side

SRI LANKA:1.6 Woakes to Gunathilaka, 1 run, edged and Hales drops it at 2nd slip. A shortish length angled across, Gunathilaka has a flash at it.

SRI LANKA:1.4 Woakes to K Perera, no run, blocked back off a length
SRI LANKA:1.3 Woakes to Gunathilaka, 1 run, loud shout but that looked high. Also an inside edge? HotSpot says otherwise. The ball nips in, takes the thigh and perhaps hits both thighs to make the double sound that might have confused the umpire

SRI LANKA:0.6 Willey to Gunathilaka, FOUR, what a way to end the over. Willey remembers that there's a slip cordon, pitches the ball very full to bring it into play but Gunathilaka foils it all with a front foot cover drive. Easy on the eyes

SRI LANKA:0.2 Willey to K Perera, 1 run, good running between the wickets. Taps it with soft hands to mid-off as Willey shortened the length and runs. A throw, a wayward throw at the bowler's end not enough to threaten Perera's charge
SRI LANKA:0.1 Willey to K Perera, no run, goes fullish first up, a hint of swing from over the wicket as Perera manages to blunt it with a slight weight forward and off the outer halfK Perera and Gunathilaka are at the crease. K Perera is on strike. Willey will open the attackTwo slipsPlayers are out there.. Willey has the ball, tosses it up as he walks to the top of his mark and readies up. The skies are blue *hush*Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kusal Perera(w), Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Seekkuge Prasanna, Upul Tharanga, Suraj Randiv, Farveez Maharoof, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga LakmalEngland (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Adil RashidSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batNo changes expected for England, at least not in the playing XI. A World T20 finale followed by a thrilling tie is a loyalty rewards system in itself. There has been rain around, and it will be around today to test our cricket appetite. The pitch though should be a good ODI wicket in accordance with the trend. Toss on its way..Last match was as much about Sri Lanka's inability to seek closure as it was about England's rallying effort to impress with its limited over credentials. A Mathews's hobbling exit from the ground signalled a larger shift in fortunes and a Buttler-Woakes stand ensued to hold Sri Lanka to an inconsolable tie. Mathews remains a major what-if tonight for Sri Lanka. 1:00pm local: The decision has been referred. Zillions of replays and many of Darwin's evolutionary generations later, and with the hope that the correct decision is being made, it's been deemed that more than half of the 52% who voted for BREXIT might have turned up without having their morning coffees. Hence, the UK will have to reverse its decision. --- Thankfully, unlike cricket, real world decisions aren't fixated on an umpire's call - the most popularly perceived 'necessary evil' since friction. A hello from a politically overdosed Pratyush Sinha to what feels like a contest better than the BREXIT referendum, and more so after that pulsating, sixth sense-shattering tied first ODI at Nottingham.Preview:On a surreal night at Trent Bridge, where the fortunes of England and Sri Lanka swung wildly back and forth, the hosts held their nerve to sneak in a pulsating tie. England found themselves in dire straits at 82 for 6, chasing a sizeable total of 287. However, stunning rearguards from Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes and Liam Plunkett ensured that parity was achieved.Sri Lanka would have been disappointed with the fact that they almost let the match slip from their hands. The tourists had England against the ropes, but they struggled to sustain the pressure. After a rather insipid performance in the Test series, Sri Lanka can take a few positives from the game. Seekkuge Prasanna netted in a flamboyant fifty and Angelo Mathews provided the ballast in the middle overs. Mathews and Suranga Lakmal also chipped in with a couple of scalps. Nuwan Pradeep largely landed in razor sharp yorkers until the final over.For the second One-Day International on Friday (June 24), the visitors would look to improve their ground fielding, which was below par at Trent Bridge. Sri Lanka also would be hoping for their top-order batsmen to convert starts into substantial scores. Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal all essayed breezy knocks, but gifted their wickets away at crucial junctures. With the track at Edgbaston expected to favour the batsmen, Sri Lanka might not tinker much with the line-up.England, on the other hand, would try to maintain the psychological edge over Sri Lanka. However, the top-order collapse at Trent Bridge ought to be a cause for concern for the home team. The focal point is that England can't bank upon the middle and lower order to pull off a jailbreak every time.In their fledgling ODI careers, Alex Hales, despite two centuries, and Jason Roy, notching up one, have grappled for consistency. Joe Root, who has been the pivot around whom the batting line-up has revolved in the recent past, also will be aiming to make his presence felt at Edgbaston. The hosts' bowling fired in bits in the first ODI and that is a part of the game, they need to closely look at.When: England vs Sri Lanka, 2nd ODI, June 24, 2016 at 2:00 PM Local Time, 6:30 PM ISTWhere: Edgbaston, BirminghamWhat to expect: Over the years, the track at Edgbaston has tended to assist the pacers up front. However, it flattens out as the game progresses. Incidentally, even spinners like Shahid Afridi and Ravindra Jadeja have shone brightly. In short, Gary Barwell, the curator at Edgbaston, is known for producing good cricket wickets. Unfortunately, the weather forecast doesn't look promising as there is a possibility of showers affecting the match.Did you know? The groundsmen at Edgbaston used a slew of special heat lamps to prepare a track that offered pace and good carry for the Test against Australia last year.Team News:England's think-tank is expected to show faith in their top order and remain unchanged. Roy has been troubled by a wrist injury, but is set to play. Their opponents, Sri Lanka, would be fretting over the fitness of Mathews. The Island nation's skipper injured his hamstring and left the field during the Trent Bridge ODI. If he doesn't play, Chandimal might be given the nod to lead the side, with Lahiru Thirimanne getting an opportunity. Stats:109 and 2: The number of runs and dismissals respectively that Jos Buttler requires to complete the double of 2000 runs and 100 dismissals.0: The number of players from the current England and Sri Lanka squads with an aggregate of 1000 or more runs in ODIs between the two sides.Who said what?"We've got lots of positives. We batted and bowled pretty well. But we were poor in the field. We can improve in all three departments, but especially in the fielding," said Angelo Mathews, after the cliffhanger at Trent Bridge"It shows the depth we've got. It's good for the team isn't it? You know you can carry on all the way through an innings. If you struggle up top then hopefully the end can get a big score and if not you can carry on from ball one," noted England's all-rounder Chris WoakesTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Seekkuge Prasanna, Upul Tharanga, Dasun Shanaka, Farveez Maharoof, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep, Suraj Randiv, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dhananjaya de SilvaEngland (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, Steven Finn, James VinceLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
