On the other hand, MS Dhoni made a cautious start before he punished Solomon Mire for some poor bowling by essaying two boundaries. India will certainly look up to Dhoni to lead from the front and play a captain's innings. India could have been in trouble, but Hamilton Masakadza dropped a sitter just before the second drinks break to give Raina a reprieve.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 18.3 overs: After the first drinks break, Zimbabwe's bowlers continued to maintain line and length. For a while, Suresh Raina struggled for timing. With Virat Kohli too getting out to the part-timer, Sikandar Raza, Zimbabwe seemed to be in front.Drinks are on the field now
INDIA:34.6 S Raza to Raina, 1 run, top edge, this is going to be a wicket and ohhhhh! Hamilton Masakadza has put down a sitter. My word! Zimbabwe can't believe it. Flighted delivery down the leg-side, Raina goes for the sweep and gets an edge, he knew straightaway that he was in trouble, there was a man perfectly stationed at short fine leg for the edge, Masakadza runs to his right, gets both hands to it but spills it. Maybe he took it too casually. Is that the game then? Only time will tell, but that should have been held. It was a dolly!

INDIA:16.4 Mupariwa to Raina, 1 run, short of a length and just outside off, dabbed away towards third man for a singleSuresh Raina, left handed bat, comes to the creaseOpeners Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan survived a few nervous moments. But whenever Zimbabwe's bowlers bowled short and wide or drifted on their pads, they took advantage of it by collecting runs. Panyangara then was rewarded for his disciplined effort with the wickets of Rohit and Dhawan. Ajinkya Rahane and Virat Kohli looked in fine touch before Rahane was run out. India certainly find themselves in a spot of bother.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis for the first 16.3 overs: Tendai Chatara and Tinashe Panyangara generally bowled with decent control with the new ball. Both the pacers generated a bit of movement in the air. In fact, ever since Panyangara took 6 for 31 for Zimbabwe Under-19 against Australia Under-19 in the Under-19 World Cup in February 2004, he has been known for bowling a fine outswinger. However, one feels that since Panyangara suffered a stress fracture on his back in mid 2000s and decided to play in the Lincolnshire Premier League in England for a few years, he has lost a yard of pace. Drinks are on the field now

Rahane has to turn back and puts in the dive, as he did so, the bat bounced up in the air even as Taylor broke the stumps. Zimbabwe needed a wicket and they have got it in the form of a run-out. Rahane run out (S Raza/Brendan Taylor) 19(24) [4s-3]Mupariwa to Rahane, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!The third umpire has been called for a run-out chance. Rahane is the man in question. A direct hit would have had him short, but is he still OUT? Looks like he is short, the bat is in the air as well. Should be the red-light for Rahane. OUT is the call

INDIA:0.1 Panyangara to Rohit, no run, on a good length and a hint of shape away from outside off, Rohit is happy to let it goRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. Panyangara will open the attackWelcome back. On a flat pitch, Zimbabwe posted their highest World Cup score against India, also the highest against India by any team in this World Cup. They fell away rather badly towards the end, but is 287 enough?Taylor: "It was a slightly two-paced wicket at the start but it flattened out after 15 overs. It was a good partnership with Sean (Williams). Unfortunately, we are 30-40 runs short. They (India) have been bowling really well. Once we got the pace of the ball, we took some calculated risks. We all know the batting power-house that they are. Anything over 300 was going to be competitive, but a little bit short in the end."On an even-paced wicket, the Indian batsmen should be confident of chasing down the target. However, if Zimbabwe can take a few wickets with the new ball, it should make for an interesting contest.Earlier, the pacers bowled superbly to put the Indian team in pole position. Both Umesh Yadav and Shami bowled with unrelenting control and extracted bounce to pick up wickets with the new ball. Zimbabwe's top-order batsmen paid the price for hanging back in the crease. However, Taylor and to a lesser extent, Williams, scripted a fine turnaround. For India, Mohit Sharma made his mark with his variations and snared three wickets. Shami and Umesh took three wickets as well. Both the spinners struggled, especially with short straight boundaries in place. It was Taylor's ability to play late and showcase good wrist-work that helped him to negotiate the Indian spinners. It has to be remembered that Sean Williams played a key role as well. Williams played with a full face of the bat, before using his feet and the depth of the crease to smash Ashwin for 16 runs in a single over. Williams was finally dismissed for a breezy innings of 50 in just 57 deliveries.He used reverse sweeps, sweeps and danced down the wicket to check in a series of marvellous strokes. In the slog overs too, Taylor was in imperious touch as he collected boundaries at will in the 38th over of the innings. He soon composed his century in just 99 balls and reached the landmark in style by ramping Mohammed Shami for a six. He became the first player from Zimbabwe to score back-to-back centuries in World Cups. He now also has the most number of hundreds for Zimbabwe in ODIs. Once Taylor completed his hundred, he thumped Jadeja for 24 runs in the 41st over. It included two sixes and three boundaries. Craig Ervine played the second fiddle to Taylor in what turned out to be a partnership dominated by Zimbabwe's captain. Once both the batsmen were dismissed, Sikandar Raza, with his pyrotechnics tried to make sure that Zimbabwe's innings won't run out of steam, but the pacers came back strongly to bowl out the opposition. India now have bowled out the opposition in every match in this World Cup. Brendan Taylor, in his last match for Zimbabwe, unfurled a slew of thunderous strokes to power them to a good total on the board. Dripping with brilliant stroke-play, Taylor lit up the Eden Park stadium. In particular, he took a heavy toll of Indian spinners, Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin.When Zimbabwe smashed Jadeja for 25 runs in the 41st over, it looked like 300 was a certainty, but the Indian bowlers have come back well to take the last 6 wickets for just 52 runs.4

ZIMBABWE:35.1 Shami to Brendan Taylor, no run, full and on the stumps, driven straight to the fielder at mid-onMohammed Shami [5.0-2-8-1] is back into the attackHere are a few more interesting facts about Taylor. He made his First-Class debut at the age of 16 for Mashonaland A. Interestingly, Taylor made his Test debut against Sri Lanka at the age of 18 without a single First-Class hundred to his name. Zimbabwe had to pick him due to a mass exodus of senior players.Both the batsmen played late, showed good wrist-work, used the depth of the crease and stayed low to bisect the gaps in the field against the spinners. Taylor and Williams then compiled fine fifties. Ashwin though, picked up the wicket of Williams. There were doubts about whether Ashwin had taken the catch cleanly, but the third umpire decided the catch was clean. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 18 overs: Two of Zimbabwe's better batsmen, Brendan Taylor and Sean Williams, played with self-belief to play fine shots as they tried to resurrect their fortunes. In fact, Taylor looked to unsettle the Indian spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja by using the reverse sweep to good effect. On the other hand, Williams played with a full face of the bat and gave Taylor good support before bringing out the reverse sweep. He also played the slog sweep to thwack Ashwin for a six. Williams continued to unfurl a series of stunning strokes. With twinkle-toed footwork, he thwacked Ashwin for two sixes and a four.Drinks are on the field now

ZIMBABWE:17.1 Mohit Sharma to Brendan Taylor, 1 run, dug in short by Mohit Sharma, Brendan Taylor fends it down and into the vacant square leg areaIn 2011, Taylor became only the second Zimbabwe batsman after Kevin Arnott to score a century in the fourth innings of a Test match. He essayed that stellar ton against New Zealand in Bulawayo. On the other hand, Arnott, known for his compact defence, had played a stoic innings against New Zealand to amass a hundred in Bulawayo in 1992. Taylor also became the first batsman from Zimbabwe to score back-to-back ODI hundreds when Zimbabwe played New Zealand in 2011.As today is also Taylor's last game for his country, here are a few interesting facts about Zimbabwe's captain for this match. He was mentored by none other than Alistair Campbell's father, Iain Campbell, during his younger days. "He (Iain Campbell) certainly was a massive influence on me at an early age along with my father. I owe a lot to him, but sadly he passed away a few years ago," Taylor was quoted as saying by cricnama.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: On a wicket that offered the Indian pacers pace and bounce, they started on a great note. Both Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav bowled with good control. Shami also generated a bit of swing. It was Umesh, who got the reward for bowling a fuller length by producing the edge to take the wicket of Hamilton Masakadza. It was the fuller length that resulted in Masakadza getting caught in the crease. Shami and Mohit Sharma then produced the wickets of Chamu Chibhabha and Solomon Mire, respectively. Zimbabwe could have found themselves in a dire straits, but MS Dhoni dropped a tough chance, with Sean Williams getting a reprieve. Zimbabwe's batsmen have paid the price for hanging back in the crease. However, Brendan Taylor has looked in fine touch. From India's point of view, they have bowled and fielded brilliantly.Drinks are on the field now

ZIMBABWE:16.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Brendan Taylor, FOUR, Shami at long-on fails to judge that properly. A better fielder would've got under that and probably caught it.

ZIMBABWE:1.6 U Yadav to Chibhabha, 2 runs, clipped to deep backward square leg, Chibhabha was coming back for the second and if there had been a good throw from Shami then he may have been struggling. Instead the throw is well wide of Dhoni and the batsmen make it easily

ZIMBABWE:0.3 Shami to Chibhabha, 1 run, Chibhabha is off the mark, with a cut, mistimed as the extra bounce forces the chop. Chibhabha hurried for pace there as Shami found a bit of zip off the track

Loud cheer greets the end of the Indian anthem. Mohammed Shami has the ball in his hand. The countdown begins and we are all set to start off. Two slips in place for Shami as he runs inPitch Report: "It's a well rolled-in surface. It is one of those drop-in pitches which is hard. It's going to be a good batting surface. Because of the short boundaries, even the mistimed shots from Dhoni, Kohli, Dhawan will go into the stands. There will be seam movement under lights. But overall, it is a good batting surface," reckons Sourav Ganguly.Teams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Chamu Chibhabha, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w/c), Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Solomon Mire, Regis Chakabva, Tinashe Panyangara, Tawanda Mupariwa, Tendai ChataraIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohit Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Umesh YadavIndia have won the toss and have opted to fieldDhoni: "When it comes to the matches you have to be at your best, you have to give your 100%. When you have the opportunity in training you have to mellow it down a bit. That's what we have been doing, but in games you have to give your 100%. We are looking to bowl first. The wicket is good over here, it remains the same. Short boundaries gives us an opportunity to chase again. There has been a lot of improvement. If we compare how we have been playing compared to the tri-series, there has been loads of improvement in all the three departments. Fielding is something that we put in a lot of effort into and definitely this is one the best fielding sides that has been around. We are playing with the same squad."Taylor: "It's an incredible feeling. It's quite an emotional day for me. But more importantly we are trying to win a game for Zimbabwe and trying to end the tournament on a good note. According to the track record here, it does probably pay to bat second, but it looks like a really good wicket, there might be a bit of bounce in it. We haven't posted the whole tournament, so it poses a new challenge and hopefully we can get a good score on these short boundaries. Against a side like India, you've got to play with freedom. What we've discussed with the guys is to go out there and enjoy this moment. Let's be remembered that we finished the tournament pretty well. I'd love to do that, but you can't guarantee it. I'll certainly give it my best shot. I know the guys will come out and give it everything today. We've got exactly the same (side) that we got against Ireland."Toss time folks!Dav Whatmore on Brendan Taylor: "It is true we will be missing Brendan Taylor who is be going to Nottingham and they are very, very lucky to have him."Quotes now. Starting with Mohammed Shami. "I am lucky that all my debuts - Tests, one-dayers, Twenty20s - all have come under Dhoni and the way he handles things looks good to me." Shami is all praise for MS Dhoni's leadership skills.Weather update: It was a hot day when both teams trained on the eve of the game and more of it is likely to continue on match day. A high of 25C is predicted for the game.Zimbabwe: Elton Chigumbura still hasn't recovered from a grade three tear to the quadriceps muscle in his left leg and looks highly unlikely for this match. So Brendan Taylor will captain in his last game for Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe may not risk playing a spinner on a small Eden Park ground, against a powerful Indian batting line-up.Pre-match team news, India: India will in all probability play the same eleven that won against Ireland.Zimbabwe's last game was against Ireland and it was a thriller. They conceded more than 300 with the ball with Ed Joyce making a hundred. They looked to be on course in the chase with Brendan Taylor's hundred leading the way. He along with Sean Williams had things under control before Taylor got out. That gave the Irish the opening and they capitalised. Sean Williams fell for 96 albeit in controversial circumstances, caught by John Mooney on the fence. Replays showed that Mooney may have touched the ad-cushions with his foot as he held on. That proved to be the turning point of the game as Ireland won by 5-runs despite Mupariwa's late heroics. That defeat also knocked Zimbabwe out of the tournament.Now to revisit India and Zimbabwe's previous games in this tournament. India played Ireland at Hamilton and achieved a feat for the first time in their ODI history. They bowled the Irish out, meaning that they had done so for the fifth time in a row - a first. The chase was very straightforward with Dhawan notching up his second ton of the tournament. India cantered home by eight wickets against a very average Ireland bowling attack.Also he reckons that Ashwin has been a revelation for India. "I think the reason is that all five bowlers have done exceptionally well. The big difference in R Ashwin, and I hope he transforms this improvement in Tests and Twenty20s, is the speed at which he has bowled. He's bowled a lot slower. Sometimes, when you see here that he is bowling at 70 or 80kmph as opposed to 90 and higher during the Test matches, you know why he has been successful. Ashwin has been a huge revelation for India."Moving on, let's now focus on what all the talk is, before the game, Sourav Ganguly, writing exclusively on our site is amazed by India's ability to lift themselves in World Championships. "It amazes me how India lift themselves in world championships. Take the 2011 World Cup, take the 2013 Champions Trophy or the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh last year and now this World Cup. Before and after that they have gone through series where they've been whitewashed. They've lost 4-0 in Test series, they went through a series of one-day losses overseas, so to turn it around from there has been a remarkable achievement."India were left shell-shocked by the result. That defeat left the standings reading like this: Zimbabwe had played two, won two; India played two, lost two. That loss to Zimbabwe eventually played a huge part in India not reaching the semi-finals of the tournament.A fifty from Sadagopan Ramesh and 43 from Ajay Jadeja set India on their way. They were heading to a win, needing just nine from two overs when Olonga was brought back into the attack by Alistair Campbell in a last throw of the dice. Olonga's previous three overs had cost 17, as he lost his run-up and bowled some spectacular wides and a beamer. Robin Singh was at the crease. But in a sensational over, Olonga got Robin caught at cover, then had Srinath bowled, slogging wildly before trapping Venky Prasad lbw off the next ball, to spark off wild celebrations amongst the Zimbabweans at Grace Road, Leicester.If Kapil Dev was the hero in 1983, Zimbabwe found their own in the form of Henry Olonga in 1999. India were playing the game without Sachin Tendulkar, who had gone home to attend his father's funeral. Without him, they lacked inspiration and were flat. Batting first Zimbabwe made 252 thanks largely in part to India's genorosity. There were 21 wides and 16 no-balls as India gave away 51 extras. That meant they were docked four overs when they batted due to the slow over-rate. The target was 253 from 46 overs.Sunil Gavaskar reckoned that Kapil's knock as the "best One-day innings" ever. "When you had lost half of your side with less than 20 runs on the board, obviously it was not looking good. But this gentleman (Kapil Dev) went out and played his innings...best innings I had seen in limited overs international. That 175 has to be in my view the greatest knock in the World Cup."Wisden had this to say about the match: "A remarkable match contained one of the most spectacular innings played in this form of cricket. India, who had chosen to bat on a pitch from which the ball moved a lot, were 9 for four - soon to be 17 for five - when their captain, Kapil Dev, came in. No-one could foresee then that a week later India would be winning the whole tournament; indeed, qualification for the semi-final was in grave doubt."One interesting thing about the match which has become part of folklore since, is the fact that there was no televised coverage of the game and hence no footage available of Kapil's innings. BBC, the official broadcaster of the tournament, was on a strike on this day.Speaking on the innings, Madan Lal said, "I also witnessed Viv Richards' 189 against England (in 1984 at Old Trafford). Thereafter, I have seen many exciting and crucial knocks, but given the rescue act that Kapil performed, it's one of my all-time favourites."This game had one of the all-time great ODI knocks from Kapil Dev. Needing a win to qualify through to the semi-final, India were reduced to 17 for five. Speaking on the match later, Madan Lal told Mid-Day, "Things were looking really bad for us when we were five down for 17 in a must-win game. The dressing room was stunned." In walked Kapil and proceeded to hit 175 runs which included 16 fours and six huge hits over the boundary. Kapil's innings pushed India to 266 and they eventually won by 31 runs.So on that emotional note, we welcome one and all to our coverage of India's clash with Zimbabwe at Eden Park in Auckland. While India are on a five game unbeaten run in the World Cup, Zimbabwe have already been knocked out. Before we go any further, let's have a look at two past memorable clashes between these two teams in World Cups. Starting with the game in 1983.When asked what the last 11 years meant to him, while playing for Zimbabwe, Taylor got a bit emotional, but recovered to say this: "It's been fairly enjoyable, the 11 years that I've been extremely grateful for. Every player's dream is to represent their country, and I've been lucky enough to do that," he said. "We've had our challenges as young players coming into the side. We've had some tough losses, but we've slowly evolved and managed to sneak a few great ones in for us. It's been thoroughly enjoyable. But you know, a very proud moment for me. Sad for me that it'll be ending, but I'm very proud to be a Zimbabwean, I'm very proud to represent my country on a great stage tomorrow to finish up and hopefully end on a high note.""I'm not too worried about maybe leaving a hole there. I certainly don't think that's the case. I think the players are definitely good enough to fill that No 4 spot in Test cricket and one-dayers.""I think there's enough depth there at the moment. We've certainly got some experienced players, we've got some young and talented players coming through," said Taylor.Taylor may be leaving Zimbabwe, but he hopes he won't be missed by his country. Taylor believes Zimbabwe have enough talent at the higher level to ensure a seamless transition from his era.It is yet another blow for Zimbabwe. In 2013, Zimbabwe fast bowler Kyle Jarvis retired from international cricket to pursue a career in county cricket and Twenty20. Before him, Anthony Ireland bowed out at 22 on a two-year deal with Gloucestershire, citing the political stranglehold of Zimbabwe's cricket administration as the reason for shunning his country. In May 2004, allrounder Sean Ervine quit international cricket at the age of 21 and left the country to go to Australia, amid the deepening crisis in Zimbabwe cricket.Why did Taylor decide to quit Zimbabwe? Because of the financial instability that the current Zimbabwean cricketers find themselves in. Taylor - the highest paid of his team-mates - decided to sign a Kolpak deal to secure his future. The current World Cup squad has still not received all their dues for past series, and their monthly salaries are estimated to be US$6,000. Taylor is reportedly paid US$10,000."We have found ourselves with two batsmen injured and face the potential loss of players to international commitments," said Newell. "We have decided to strengthen our batting order with Brendan, a proven player who will be an excellent addition to the side."Nottinghamshire's Director of Cricket Mick Newell expressed his delight at having acquired the services of Taylor. The club also revealed that 'specific arrangements' would be discussed with the player after the World Cup.12:30 Local Time, 23:30 GMT, 05:00 IST: Do it for Brendan Taylor. Do it for BT. Do it for him, Zimbabwe. After 23 Tests, 166 ODIs and 25 T20Is, Brendan Taylor has bid goodbye to Zimbabwean cricket. With over 5000 runs in the ODI format, Brendan Taylor was and is, Zimbabwe's best batsman. Brendan Taylor has signed a Kolpak agreement with County side Nottinghamshire. Speaking about the development, Taylor told reporters at Eden Park: "It's been one of the toughest decisions of my career. I have been very passionate about playing for Zimbabwe, but it's a decision I had to make. I can't give you that answer (whether I would like to settle down there) because it's the first time I am going there. I just want to go there and play some good competitive cricket and provide for my family. That's the main thing behind it I will see how it goes the first year and then take a call."Preview by Jamie AlterThe final 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup group stage match for India and Zimbabwe at Eden Park on Saturday has been given added incentive for one of the teams: it will be Brendan Taylor's last international assignment before he leaves Zimbabwe on a three-year Kolpak deal with English county Nottinghamshire. Zimbabwe have not managed to make the quarter-finals, and so should be driven to give their outgoing star and former captain a fitting farewell against the defending champions.It will, of course, not be easy. India have not lost a match in this tournament, and have ticked many boxes in doing so. Wins by 76 runs, 130 runs, nine wickets, four wickets and eight wickets have carried MS Dhoni's team into the knockouts on a wave of confidence and credibility - they had been beaten hollow in the preceding tri-series in Australia - and they will be eager to iron out any remaining creases before their quarter-final fixture.India's pace bowlers enjoyed the extra bounce in Australia when they played Pakistan, South Africa, UAE and West Indies, but in Hamilton their trio of pace bowlers struggled early on as Ireland's openers put on the best start against India in the tournament. On that flat deck it was spin that pulled Ireland back, with R Ashwin, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja keeping things tidy. At Eden Park there should be more lift, as evidenced by the last game here between Pakistan and South Africa, which would make Dhoni's job a bit easier. Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Mohit Sharma have performed credibly when paired with each other, and if this track has carry similar to what India found in Australia, they will be hard to handle. The bounce will also bring Ashwin into play, asking questions of a Zimbabwean batting order that, with the exception of Taylor (295 runs) and Sean Williams (289) has underwhelmed.The opener Sikandar Raza averages 19.40 in five innings without a fifty; Craig Ervine in the middle order has one fifty for an average of 26.40; the veteran Hamilton Masakadza, in his first World Cup, averages 24; Chamu Chibhabha has one fifty in three innings; the much-talked of Solomon Mire, who learnt most of his cricket in Australia, has a best of 27 in four innings. Tackling India's in-form bowling will require more than two batsmen shoring up the innings.Taylor, who will bow out after playing his 167th ODI, spoke of the challenge that India's bowlers will pose in the midst of a successful run. "We all know how such a power house they are at batting, but they certainly hold their own with the ball. They've had proven performances with their spinners, and we see how well they've done for India over the years, and even in conditions that are not so suited so them, they've still been very difficult to get away," he said. "Even the new-ball bowlers have struck early, where they possibly haven't done that in the past, and they're bowling with some good pace, too. That's certainly good for Indian cricket, and it'll be very challenging for us tomorrow, not just the pace but the swing they're producing at the moment."Zimbabwe's captain at the World Cup, Elton Chigumbura, missed the last game against Ireland because of a grade three tear to the quadriceps muscle in his left leg and looks highly unlikely for this match. On Thursday, Chigumbura did not train hard with the team and was seen walking around Eden Park with the physiotherapist, and with Taylor coming to address the media in the customary pre-match press conference, all indications are that Chigumbura is not match ready.India went through their paces at the practice ground adjacent to Eden Park on Friday, giving little indication of any changes to a winning unit. Dhoni is not generally a man to tinker needlessly, so it seems the likes of Stuart Binny, Ambati Rayudu and Axar Patel will continue to serve drinks.Saturday looks like a hot day in Auckland, on a surface with plenty of runs in it.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Chamu Chibhabha, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(c & k), Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Solomon Mire, Regis Chakabva, Tinashe Panyangara, Tawanda Mupariwa, Tendai Chatara, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Prosper Utseya, Stuart MatsikenyeriIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(c & k), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohit Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Ambati Rayudu, Axar Patel, Stuart Binny, Bhuvneshwar KumarLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
