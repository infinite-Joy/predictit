SOUTH AFRICA:47.2 47.2Adil Rashid to Tahir, FOUR, South Africa win by 1 wicket. This was not the googly as many would have expected. Dishes out a legbreak and Tahir thrashes it past the infield and it scoots to the fence. It was all meant to be. Tahir had to hit the winning run and we were destined to see him celebrate. Punches the air and lets out a roarAnother wrong'un? Morris had a few words to say to TahirImran Tahir, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:47.1 Adil Rashid to C Morris, out Bowled!! And he's gone. This is as anti-climactic as it can get. One run to get with the red-hot man on strike. Doesn't read the googly that in all fairness was a gentler with the pace, Morris waits to thrash it through covers but misses and it pegs the off stick back. C Morris b Adil Rashid 62(38) [4s-3 6s-4]Adil Rashid to C Morris, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Adil Rashid [5.0-0-34-1] is back into the attackSurprise! Rashid has the ball..

SOUTH AFRICA:46.3 Stokes to C Morris, SIX, that's the sealing blow perhaps. He's on fire! Looks like the Wanderers will collapse.

SOUTH AFRICA:45.1 Broad to C Morris, SIX, Morris is breathing fire. Was already on his leg-stump to make room, Broad follows him and he backs away further to clobber this over deep mid-wicket. Just threw everything on this and took on the fielders in the deepStuart Broad [6.0-0-40-1] is back into the attackI wish I could describe Bullring's atmosphere. Imagine lakhs of pink bees buzzing and waiting encircled to victimize someone. Broad has the ball..
SOUTH AFRICA:44.6 Woakes to Kyle Abbott, no run, back of a length outside off, Abbott hops and taps it in front of cover. A bit of yes-and-no but they aborted the idea of a run before it became dangerousLast ball. Broad has a chat with Woakes..

SOUTH AFRICA:44.1 Woakes to C Morris, FOUR, Rashid is not having a good fielding night! Morris throws his hand on the lofted drive, ekes out an outside edge. Rashid at third man dives to stop but then parries the ball awayChris Woakes [7.0-1-28-1] is back into the attackDoesn't look over, this. South Africa need 37 runs in 36 balls. Hang on! Long conference between Woakes and Morgan..

SOUTH AFRICA:42.3 Stokes to Kyle Abbott, 1 run, direct-hit and it would have been a goodbye for Abbott. Morgan collects this pat from Abbott and runs across at short cover to under-arm the ball at the bowler's end. Misses it and Abbott lets out a sigh of relief

SOUTH AFRICA:37.4 Topley to Wiese, no run, loud, loud shout for LBW, was there an inside edge? The umpire certainly thinks so, Wiese was quick to show his bat to the umpire as well and replays suggest he had jammed it back onto the pads.

SOUTH AFRICA:28.6 Adil Rashid to Duminy, out Lbw!! Will Duminy review? No he doesn't. Shakes his head after having a chat with Behardien and walks off. Rashid strikes with one that turned and raps the batsman right in front. Duminy should've been forward to that sharply turning delivery, but went back and didn't get the bat down in time. The ball skidded on and trapped him in front of all three. Easy call for the umpire and sensibly Duminy doesn't waste the review. England needed that wicket.

SOUTH AFRICA:24.6 Woakes to Duminy, out de Villiers Run Out!! Why Duminy, why Duminy? That was an unnecessary call from him and he has cost his side a wicket. That too of de Villiers. But what a piece of fielding that is from Woakes. It was nudged to the left of the bowler, maybe de Villiers was a bit late to set off, Woakes sprinted forward and then under-armed it direct catching a diving de Villiers short. A one-handed pick up and throw, lightning quick reflexes and athletic ability to get the quick silver AB out. Will that be the series winning moment? Only time will tell. Woakes knew it as soon as he hit direct, his side were mobbing him in celebration and the third umpire confirmed the same. de Villiers run out (Woakes) 36(27) [4s-4 6s-1]Woakes to Duminy, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!Has Woakes run AB out? Yes he has. What a bad call from Duminy that is. AB knows he is gone and the third umpire is called for here.

SOUTH AFRICA:24.3 Woakes to de Villiers, FOUR, that's arrogance from AB. Sheer arrogance. Can't describe any other way. It was a length delivery outside off, many batsmen would've defended that, but AB had made up his mind to pull even before the ball left Woakes' hand, rocked back and thumped it wide of mid-on. Has a smile at Duminy after getting the boundary. Woakes knew how good a shot that was and let out a "ooooh" shrugging his shoulders to suggest he was helpless at the genius batting on show
SOUTH AFRICA:24.2 Woakes to de Villiers, FOUR, full outside off, de Villiers dismisses it from his presence. No intentions of keeping the ball down. Cover leapt high to catch but was never in his range. Rocketed away

SOUTH AFRICA:18.3 Broad to de Villiers, SIX, take that Broad, I'm coming for you, seems to say AB. Down the track and to the pitch of the ball before lofting it to the long-on fence.

Full delivery outside off, de Villiers square drives it uppishly as one hand came off the bat handle after he played it and it carries to Roy at point who puts down the opportunity after diving to his right. He had the ball in his hand until he went to ground and it popped out. What a move that would have been had Roy taken it. This could well be the moment of the series.

SOUTH AFRICA:17.6 Stokes to Duminy, no run, full and angling in, Duminy completely missed it and wears it on the pads. Stokes and Co. go for a review and is turned down as the impact is umpire's call. Duminy was playing around the flick and was struck low on the pads. Would've been crashing into the stumps.

Stokes comes round the wicket and angles it into Duminy who misses the flick. The umpire check for the no-ball, impact is umpire's call so the batsman survives. Mighty close that and certainly crashing into the stumps. Since the umpire didn't give it out, Duminy will continue batting. England lose their only reviewStokes comes round the wicket

On a back of a length and outside off, Duminy went hard on the punch, a thick outside edge flew to the right of Hales who went with bot hands and could only parry it away as the ball was travelling. It was going to the left of Jordan at first slip, but Hales went for it. Mind you, Jordan doesn't drop many. How costly will that drop turn out to be? Woakes is a frustrated man

Dream delivery for any bowler and what a sight, Woakes bowls this full and gets it to swing away late, du Plessis looks to drive as he stumbled forward with a closed bat face and is beaten all ends up. He was opened up like a tin of biscuits. The stumps go for a toss. He did nothing wrong there, just that the ball was too good. Woakes can certainly produce gems like that every now and then. England have two in two overs now and have comeback into the game. Woakes is jumping around in joy. du Plessis b Woakes 34(38) [4s-4]Woakes to du Plessis, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!

Dragged on!! de Kock looked to play this back of a length delivery with soft hands but, only manages to get an inside edge that rattles middle and leg stump, Stokes yet again breaks the partnership which he's very good at. Like Root when England need someone to stand up and be counted, it is Stokes who does it with the ball. Certainly looked chuffed as his mates mobbed him. Angry too. What a big wicket that is. de Kock b Stokes 27(42) [4s-4]Stokes to de Kock, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!

This will take a while. du Plessis has a word with Broad and with a smile on his face to boot.

Full outside off, Amla leant forward to cover-drive, got an inside edge onto the back pad and the ball dribbled to flick the off bail.

Broad will open the attackBroad with the ball. Two slips in place for the right-handed Amla. Amla in bright pink with an even brighter shade of pads which are in green. Can't say much for colour-co-ordination, can you?Welcome back for the chase. Should be a good one under lights. England need to get Amla and de Kock early to give themselves a chance of winning the series tonight. The Protea openers are in great nick and coming off tons in the last game. Let's see whether there is any swing on offer and also if it skids on. All eyes on Broad - playing in his first ODI since the 2015 World Cup. Back on the same ground where he destroyed the hosts in the Test match. Still bright and sunny but the lights are on. The England players are walking outEarlier on, Roy failed after getting a start while Hales threw it away after becoming the first Englishman to get four successive fifties against South Africa in ODIs. That sparked a collapse but when Joe Root is batting like he has been doing, allied to a batting-order that bats pretty deep, it was always difficult for South Africa to run through the line-up. My money is on South Africa to chase this down in 42 overs. Let's see how that goes. We will be back shortly with the chase...So England have been bowled out with 13 balls remaining. They were at one stage in danger of being bowled out earlier than that, when they were 108/6 but once again Root came to the party. Along with Woakes he put on a stand and resurrected the innings. Root kept his head when the middle-order collapsed and calmly got to his second successive hundred. His innings has given his side a total to bowl at, though it must be said England look at least 40 short on this Johannesburg pitch. But one thing it must be noted here, this pitch looks a bit slower and there is some uneven bounce on offer. Under lights, it may skid on and both de Kock and Amla are coming off hundreds in the last game.4
ENGLAND:47.5 Rabada to Adil Rashid, out Caught by de Villiers!! How did de Villiers make that look so easy? As easy as snatching candy from a kid. Cross-seamer from Rabada, Adil Rashid flat-batted that and miscued it, off the bottom of the bat, it was going to the left of mid-off and low, AB covered ground and took it with both hands. Gets up and nonchalantly flicks the ball back. Athletic ability at its best. Any other fielder and it would've escaped to the fence.

Nice little touch from the South Africans, when Root was walking back, Morris ran up and shook his hand. That's why the Proteas are such a loved outfit.

ENGLAND:44.3 C Morris to Adil Rashid, 1 run, yorker outside off, dug out to point, quick single taken
ENGLAND:44.2 C Morris to Adil Rashid, 2 runs, leading edge and Behardien drops running in from long-off. That should've been taken, especially once he got there. It was full outside off, Adil Rashid early into the flick and got a hefty leading edge, maybe Behardien was put off by Rabada running in from extra cover, must have seen him in his peripheral vision, came forward, slid on his knees, got both hands and out it went. Behardien wears a sorry look on his face
ENGLAND:44.1 C Morris to Adil Rashid, FOUR, huge dive from de Kock but the edge eludes the keeper and runs away. Full outside off and Adil Rashid got a thick edge on the attempted cover drive. Regulation catch if there was a slipChris Morris [8.0-0-44-0] is back into the attack

ENGLAND:43.3 Tahir to Root, 2 runs, it was slower and Root was shaping for the paddle initially, then saw it outside off, changed his mind and opens the face of the bat to glide it to third man. So effortlessly done, shows the talent of the man
ENGLAND:43.2 Tahir to Root, 2 runs, rocks back and wrists it to deep mid-wicket, the call was for two and they come back easily
ENGLAND:43.1 Tahir to Root, FOUR, shouts of "catch" but that has gone to the fence. It was short on the stumps, Root rocked back and pulled it to deep mid-wicket, wide of the fielder. Four moreImran Tahir [9.0-0-36-3] is back into the attack
ENGLAND:42.6 Wiese to Adil Rashid, FOUR, length outside off, Adil Rashid sits on one knee and heaves it over mid-on, who was inside the ring. Calculated blow as he knew the ball was there for the taking, since the fielder wasn't back. Good way to end the over
ENGLAND:42.5 Wiese to Adil Rashid, no run, meanwhile Adil Rashid is beaten, tried to play inside the line of that good length delivery that straightened outside off, the ball whizzes past the edge
ENGLAND:42.4 Wiese to Root, 1 run, 100 yet again for Root. Successive hundreds and his eighth in ODIs. Got there with a flick to deep square leg. So easy as there were gaps on the leg-side. No big celebration, just a raise of the bat and then kisses the crest on his helmet. Nice touch from AB and Amla who clap that effort. When his side is in trouble, expect Root to come to the party. Another classy innings when his side needed him to stand up. What a player and what a talent. And so young as well. Right up there with the best batsmen in the world currently
ENGLAND:42.3 Wiese to Adil Rashid, 1 run, full outside off, whipped to deep mid-wicket, and that brings Root on strike
ENGLAND:42.2 Wiese to Adil Rashid, no run, and just as I said that, he plays a nothing shot and gets beaten. Similar delivery to the last one, but this moved away and Adil Rashid pushed out, trying to run it down and is beaten. Lucky not to have edged that
ENGLAND:42.1 Wiese to Adil Rashid, FOUR, beautiful lofted drive on a bent knee and it has gone for four. Over cover. It was pitched up outside off and Adil Rashid went down to time that, beats sweeper to his left, lovely pose after playing the stroke. This guy can bat
ENGLAND:41.6 Rabada to Adil Rashid, 1 run, full around off, Adil Rashid gets forward and defends, the ball runs off a sort of a thick outside edge, all along the ground and down to third man

ENGLAND:41.2 Rabada to Woakes, out Caught by de Kock!! A little nick and gone. High bouncer and Woakes was late on the hook, got a toe and a leaping take by de Kock. Rabada has broken through but Woakes has done his job. That was well bowled, over the shoulder of Woakes and it is always difficult to control the shot when it is bouncing so high.

ENGLAND:39.6 Tahir to Root, no run, good review from Root. He should know whether he has hit that or not. It was a googly on middle and leg, Root was looking to drive that off the front foot. Got a thin inside edge onto the pad. The umpire didn't spot that and raised the finger, Root went for it and the original decision was overturned. UltraEdge showing a thin spike as the ball met bat. Tahir will have to wait for a while to celebrate again. He was high-fiving his team-mates when the finger went up, but he too must have known that there was a slight nick. Root will bat on in the ninetiesRoot has reviewed that. Immediately too. Was there an inside edge onto the pad? Slight deflection on the first replay and UltraEdge confirms that. Root will stay. The original decision will be overturned
ENGLAND:39.5 Tahir to Root, no run, googly on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler
ENGLAND:39.4 Tahir to Woakes, 1 run, dabbed to short third man, an agile fielder would've had a better fist of running out Root, but Kyle Abbott allows the ball to come to him and allows the quick single. Lax stuff

ENGLAND:38.6 Kyle Abbott to Root, FOUR, Tahir needed to dive at backward square leg. Didn't and allowed the boundary. This slower ball bouncer sat up and Root rolled his wrists to pull it wide of Tahir inside the ring, short boundary and deep square had too much ground to cover

ENGLAND:36.5 Kyle Abbott to Root, SIX, there comes the big hit. Walks out and then biffs the length ball over mid-on. A flat hit and went all the way, outsmarted the bowler there by rushing out. It was bowled on a length and Root got good bat on it to get a six
ENGLAND:36.4 Kyle Abbott to Root, no run, this is a bad delivery but Root has toe-ended the pull to mid-on. Was early into the shot and didn't time it. It was short and begging to be hit
ENGLAND:36.3 Kyle Abbott to Root, FOUR, magnificent shot. It was just a fraction short, but Root is in such fine nick, rocks back and then murders the pull past a diving Amla at mid-wicket. The ball rocketed away to the fence, leaving no chance for the deep fielder. How well he timed that. Kyle Abbott shouldn't feel bad for it was not a bad delivery at all

ENGLAND:35.1 Wiese to Root, no run, slower delivery outside off, Root plays a crisp drive but straight to the fielder at extra cover
ENGLAND:34.6 C Morris to Root, 1 run, it has been quite a usual trend in this series - ABD failing to hit the stumps that is. Root shuffles and flicked this to mid-on and set off. He saw AB rushing forward and aborted, sent Woakes back. Woakes though gave up as he was half-way down the track, AB misses the target and the duo cross over on the overthrow. Woakes had given up but AB missed, but not by much

ENGLAND:33.2 Wiese to Woakes, 1 run, flicked away to deep square leg
ENGLAND:33.1 Wiese to Woakes, FOUR, four straightaway, that was played deliberately. Waits inside the crease and steers this delivery past the keeper, no slip in place and Woakes can breathe a sigh of reliefSo, after a yawn-inducing first hour of play, Tahir - Who was caught napping thus far in the series, woke up and bamboozled the English batsmen with his googlies. Hales, Morgan, Stokes - All three had no clue and Tahir looked unstoppable during that spell. Abbott consumed 2 wickets with short deliveries and so far the trend has been - Bowl short balls and googlies and get wickets. Must say, England batters were lackadaisical in their approach and are now staring at a modest total finish. Let's see if Root and Woakes can pull something off.... Here's Wiese...

Three googlies and three wickets. Mind you! Amla just grabbed a stunner at first slip. So it's more of an Amla wicket I would say. It was a googly which Stokes didn't pick. He gropes with loose hands and the outside edge flies to the right of Amla who times the dive to perfection. O-N-E H-A-N-D-E-D S-T-U-N-N-E-R. Stokes c Amla b Tahir 2(2)Tahir to Stokes, THAT'S OUT!!

He strokes and gets a thick top-edge which lobs high towards backward point who reverse-cups in front of his face. England are in some sort of trouble now.

Broad and Woakes come in. We want to have a stronger squad going into a tournament. Broad has huge experience and we want to play him. We will try to be as aggressive as we can. We will keep that mindset with the bat and ball. It's an opportunity to play on a wonderful day against a quality side."de Villiers: "The spikes went in, it might be a little bit sticky, so hopefully we can get some wickets early. The ball flies in the air and we love chasing here under lights. Morkel out and Morris in. Morris is handy with the bat and ball. Good memories in the past playing in pink."Team changes: South Africa bring in Chris Morris for Morkel. For England, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes replace Jordan and Willey. Chop-and-change for South Africa despite a win in the last match but you can hold back Morris, riding high on a million dollar IPL contract, only for so long. On the other side, Jordan's blindening AB-ending catch couldn't help him survive allowing Broad to play his first ODI since the World Cup. David Miller's extras' jersey refuses to abandon him and we will see him warming the bench again.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, David Wiese, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Chris Morris, Imran TahirEngland (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Jos Buttler(w), Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Reece TopleySouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to fieldPretty in Pink: The Proteas will turn up in what will resemble their Test whites dyed in light hues of pink. The occasion, driven by Cricket South Africa (CSA) and PinkDrive, attempts to garner support for cancer-affected people and raise awareness for the disease. Previous "Pink ODIs", which have all been won by the hosts, have raised almost half-a-million rand for the global cause and the administrators hope the same for this year too.Despite South Africa's dear pace and bounce on offer at Johannesburg, this place was the very venue where Broad dumped them for an 83 all out. Different formats alright but mental demons are seldom a function of that. One very big consolation is this game being the anniversary for de Villiers's fastest ODI ton vs West Indies last year and the 360-degree protractor will be clad in pink again today to threaten as much, if not more. Given the batting form, the side-on pitch and the cheap runs that this format offers, expect batsmen to brave through predicted thunderstorms and pile up scores.1-0. 2-0. 2-1. The Centurion sojourn helped South Africa tailor a chase to get back in the series and more importantly hoist their confidence higher. A Test series drubbing followed by two back-to-back ODI losses must have hurt but Quinton de Kock, en route to being the youngest to 10 tons, and Amla, reveling in recently rediscovered form, saved Proteas the blushes by stitching together a record opening stand and, to the relief of many, ushered life and contest into this series. If the Newlands rubber has to stay relevant, South Africa have to notch up a win tonight. Hello and welcome to the fourth ODI at the "Bullring".Teams:England (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Jos Buttler(w), Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Reece Topley, James Taylor, Jonny Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes, Liam PlunkettSouth Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, David Wiese, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Rilee Rossouw, Chris Morris, Marchant de LangeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
