INDIA:36.3 Hastings to M Pandey, 2 runs, what to call that shot? Banged in halfway down, Pandey stands his ground, raises his bat like a telescope and uses his wrists to place it through the vacant mid-wicket region. That is the best I can do to describe that shot
INDIA:36.2 Hastings to M Pandey, 2 runs, 2nd ODI fifty for Pandey. What an innings under pressure. Walks up to his skipper and is being congratulated.

INDIA:34.6 Hastings to Dhoni, no run, huge shout for LBW. Dhoni immediately showed his bat to the umpire. Was there an inside edge? Need a replay to confirm it. The good thing for India is that the umpire didn't give the marching orders. Nipped back in from a fuller length, Dhoni is rooted to the crease, is almost beaten for pace. Hastings asks Dhoni if there was an edge, the Indian skipper replies with a nod. Replays are out and there was an inside edgeMS Dhoni, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:34.5 Hastings to Rohit, out Caught by Wade!! Heartbreak! Rohit can't believe the umpire has raised his finger. Lets out a cry of anguish. He falls one short of his third hundred in the series. Is this the opening Australia were looking for? Once again it is Hastings who provides the crucial breakthrough. But the main question is was there an edge? With the way Wade went up, I don't think he was confident. However, Hastings was and so were the rest of the Aussies. It was short of length just outside off, Rohit goes for the dab to third man. HotSpot didn't show anything on the bat. The Snicko showed a spike though. It was a 50-50 call and it went in favour of the home side.

INDIA:33.6 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, 1 run, dropped! Shaun Marsh have you just spilled the match? Earlier he took a ripper to get rid of Dhawan and now he has grassed a straightforward chance, and that too of his little brother. Fuller and around off, Rohit goes for the loft over mid-off, the bat turned on impact and skied it towards sweeper. Finch runs back from backward point and that might have put off Shaun, goes for the reverse cup and puts it down

INDIA:33.4 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, 2 runs, we can rename this series as a record-breaking series. Here's one more - Rohit has crossed 5000 ODI runs. Looks like he has no clue about it. Just continues batting. Shortens the length around off, steered away with an angled bat to square third man

INDIA:32.3 Lyon to Rohit, 1 run, that is a risky single. If not for the dive from Pandey, he would have been a goner. Rohit taps this towards cover and takes off, Pandey went without any hesitation. Direct hit would have had him shortThird umpire called in for a run-out check. Australians are not too excited. That is because Pandey has made it in. Should be an easy decision for the TV umpire. NOT OUT!
INDIA:32.2 Lyon to Rohit, no run, waits for the ball to turn and tucks it to square leg
INDIA:32.1 Lyon to Rohit, 2 runs, for a second I thought Rohit picked out deep mid-wicket. But he has the map well mugged up. Shimmies down and chips it on the bounce to Marsh, collects a braceNathan Lyon [5.0-0-38-0] is back into the attack

INDIA:26.3 Lyon to M Pandey, 1 run, slower through the air on middle, gently flicked through mid-wicket

INDIA:26.1 Lyon to Rohit, 1 run, skips down the track and drives it down to long-off
INDIA:25.6 Boland to M Pandey, no run, length ball just outside off, Pandey looks to angle it through the off-side. Taking too many liberties I would think. Nearly costs him. Chops it back onto the pad off the inside edge and rolls away perilously wide of off-stump

INDIA:25.1 Boland to M Pandey, 1 run, dabbed down to third man. Signs of relative comfort emitted from Pandey. Should settle Rohit down too
INDIA:24.6 Lyon to Rohit, no run, dances down and nearly yorks himself by getting too close to the pitch, jams it to cover
INDIA:24.5 Lyon to M Pandey, 1 run, clipped through the mid-wicket region
INDIA:24.4 Lyon to M Pandey, FOUR, broomed away! Tossed up on a length on middle, Pandey gets down on one knee and slams the sweep. In the air for a trifle bit, but Shaun Marsh at backward square can only watch it zoom past
INDIA:24.3 Lyon to Rohit, 1 run, plants his front foot across to get inside the line, bends his back knee and paddles it fine. Wide enough of short fine leg to facilitate a single
INDIA:24.2 Lyon to M Pandey, 1 run, he's really not bothering to give it any air. Very unlike Lyon. Short on the stumps, Pandey swivels across and pulls it to deep backward square
INDIA:24.1 Lyon to M Pandey, no run, flatter trajectory and turning in from middle, tucked to mid-wicketNathan Lyon [3.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:23.6 Boland to Rohit, no run, length on the stumps, clipped to mid-wicket
INDIA:23.5 Boland to Rohit, SIX, that's been shoved over long-on. No better word came into my mind. Came forward and authoritatively pulled it straight back. And a spectator is furious with himself. For dropping the catch
INDIA:23.4 Boland to Rohit, no run, gets on his toes and drops this short of length delivery into the off-side
INDIA:23.3 Boland to Rohit, no run, back of a length delivery, turned to mid-on
INDIA:23.2 Boland to M Pandey, 1 run, picks this full ball from middle and clips it through mid-wicket
INDIA:23.1 Boland to M Pandey, no run, takes a couple of steps and works it airily down the pitch, again the two paced nature doing the batsman in. Falls just short of BolandScott Boland [4.0-0-25-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:22.6 Hastings to Rohit, FOUR, edged to slip and it's gone through his palms. Or did he get only fingertips? Might have been the latter. Shortish outside off, Rohit aims a square cut, didn't move his back foot across, nor did he get on top of the bounce. The top-edge flies over Smith's left, he leaps across stretching both hands. But couldn't quite place it in the centre of his palms. Tips it over and down to the third man fence
INDIA:22.5 Hastings to M Pandey, 1 run, there's the animal instincts of Pandey. Just can't restrain himself. Throws his bat for a loose drive to a length ball outside off, never in control of his movements. The outside edge flies away past the slip fielder down to third man
INDIA:22.4 Hastings to Rohit, 1 run, waits for the ball to come on and dabs it away behind backward point. Ensured that he stayed leg-side of this length ball and played it level with the eyeline
INDIA:22.3 Hastings to Rohit, no run, there's the extra bounce in play again. Rohit sees the width and looks to slash it away. Bounces over the top edge through to the keeper
INDIA:22.2 Hastings to Rohit, no run, back of a length delivery skidding on outside off, chopped to backward point
INDIA:22.1 Hastings to Rohit, no run, how about taking a pull shot on? Not at this stage. Rohit wisely bails out. Sees it whir past his right here
INDIA:21.6 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, 1 run, glided wide of point and hurries to the other end to bring up fifty. Needs to bat through here
INDIA:21.5 Mitchell Marsh to M Pandey, 1 run, nudged in front of mid-on and sets off for the single. The lack of hesitation sees them through with ease
INDIA:21.4 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, 3 runs, that's what family is all about. To save your backs. Short ball outside off, absolutely slapped square of the wicket. Shaun Marsh runs to his left, dives and flicks it back in
INDIA:21.3 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, no run, walks over to off-stump, plays round the front pad and glances it to short fine
INDIA:21.2 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, no run, short of length delivery outside off, patted towards point
INDIA:21.1 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, no run, oh jeez, that's fallen just short of short cover. If Rohit didn't learn his lesson seeing Kohli perish, he should now. Please beware driving on the up. Stops on him from a length, ends up holding his shot, and slowed the bat speed just enough on impact
INDIA:20.6 Hastings to M Pandey, no run, short ball outside off, Pandey thought about a ramp, but then pulled out
INDIA:20.5 Hastings to M Pandey, no run, and again. Take your time. Sensible strategy. Leaving the ball is the simplest part of its execution
INDIA:20.4 Hastings to M Pandey, no run, back of a length delivery in the channel, another leave
INDIA:20.3 Hastings to M Pandey, no run, fullish and angling in from outside off, Pandey thinks he knows where his off-stump is. Lets it goManish Pandey, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:20.2 Hastings to Kohli, out Caught by Wade!! Huge. India will have to pursue this target without their best batsman in a run-chase now. Massive moment in the game. Fullish outside off, however not that full also to be flashing at it. Kohli looks to hit it hard, ends up throwing his bat away from the body aiming a blistering cover-drive and the extra bounce does him in. Gets a faint tickle through to Wade who takes it head high. Kohli c Wade b Hastings 8(11) [4s-1]Hastings to Kohli, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:20.1 Hastings to Kohli, no run, angled in on middle, clipped to mid-wicket
INDIA:19.6 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, 1 run, glided nicely down to third man. He's really improved his game a lot with these deliveries. Short of length outside off, the pre-modified Kohli would have aimlessly dangled his bat at them. Not this one
INDIA:19.5 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, no run, deviates slightly from the ploy, bowls it fuller on off and is driven back. Does well to bend low, stick his arm out and stop
INDIA:19.4 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, no run, cut away but straight to backward point. Seems a concerted plan to pound it on a short of length to him
INDIA:19.3 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery on the stumps, stays rooted to his crease and blocks
INDIA:19.2 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, 2 runs, if the previous one was all grace, this is brash. Short of length just outside off, tries to force the flat-batted swat through the off-side. Chops it in the end without any timing but in the gap. Sweeper cover runs across to tidy up
INDIA:19.1 Mitchell Marsh to Kohli, FOUR, this is liquid batting. So easy, so flowy. Just a tad full outside off, came forward and across before unleashing a classic extra-cover drive
INDIA:18.6 Hastings to Kohli, 1 run, there's one universal thing you've got to adhere to as a bowler. Smith should hold a placard "Don't bowl on his pads". Clipped through mid-wicket
INDIA:18.5 Hastings to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off, punched to cover point. Played away from the body this time. Gotta be careful
INDIA:18.5 Hastings to Kohli, wide, another one. Smell the leather Mr. Kohli? But he couldn't get a good sniff - that's how high it was. Didn't even need to duck to evade
INDIA:18.5 Hastings to Kohli, wide, banged in halfway down, flies over Kohli's head as he half-ducks to evade. Wide given
INDIA:18.4 Hastings to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery which hurries onto Kohli's pull, ends up mistiming it from high on the bat towards mid-onBeautifully played. How's that for a first ball. Hops on his toes and upper-cuts it over the slip fielder. Now what? It's being signalled dead ball. That nasty spider-cam has come in the way. It hit flush on the spider. And Kohli's been robbed. Puts on a face mimicking a child who has had his cookie stolen
INDIA:18.3 Hastings to Rohit, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off, punched through coverVirat Kohli, right handed bat, comes to the creaseThat wicket also brings the drinks trolley onto the field. India once again got off to a flier, thanks to Dhawan who went hammer and tongs, before playing one shot too many. Australia needed that wicket and we know how dangerous they can be once they smell a small opening. The next passage of play is going to be an interesting one...
INDIA:18.2 Hastings to Dhawan, out Caught by S Marsh!! Someone has brought in the time machine. We are back in 2015 at the World Cup semi-final. Dhawan advancing, slashing, and holing out. That time it cost India the game. Lost all momentum. And he's done it again. Hastings bowled it wider after seeing Dhawan come hurling down, he slashes it, hits it well but there is a man in the deep. Marsh runs back towards his left, keeps his eyes on the ball right through, times his jump to perfection and cups it before tumbling over. Big breakthrough. Dhawan c S Marsh b Hastings 78(56) [4s-7 6s-3]Hastings to Dhawan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:18.1 Hastings to Dhawan, FOUR, and Dhawan just continues to hurtle along at a rapid pace. The bowling is his best ally at the moment. Short of length on the hips, he swivels across and pulls it fine. Bit of an under edge and it scoots awayJohn Hastings [4.0-0-27-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:17.6 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, no run, stands tall and punches this back of a length delivery to mid-off
INDIA:17.5 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, no run, ah, cramped for room. Moved his back foot across a bit too much looking for an expansive square cut. Also what deceived him was the extra bounce. Whizzed over the top edge through to Wade
INDIA:17.4 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, 2 runs, plants his foot across and drives it on the up through the cover region. Knows exactly where he has hit it, calls for two and makes it in a canter
INDIA:17.3 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, no run, length ball on middle, forward and blocked
INDIA:17.2 Mitchell Marsh to Dhawan, 1 run, shortish outside off, slapped to deep cover
INDIA:17.1 Mitchell Marsh to Dhawan, FOUR, wow, what a shot that is. Improvisation at its very best. Was challenged with a short ball after coming down the track, Dhawan's hands take over. Opens the bat face and ramps it over short third manMitchell Marsh [2.0-0-18-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:16.6 Lyon to Dhawan, 1 run, catch it, surely. Or maybe not. The ball is will-o'-the-wisp. Misreads the length and attempts to sweep a full delivery. Top edges it right over the keeper's head and it lands between three converging fielder
INDIA:16.5 Lyon to Dhawan, FOUR, lovely use of the crease. Went very deep realizing the opportunity. Only slightly short and he has late-cut it splitting backward point and short third man
INDIA:16.4 Lyon to Rohit, 1 run, kicks and bites at Rohit from behind a length outside off, he does well not to commit forward. Enables him to ride the bounce and push it towards mid-off.
INDIA:16.3 Lyon to Rohit, no run, Finch has stopped a certain boundary here. Rohit absolutely clubbed the sweep, albeit along the turf, behind square. Finch threw himself across to stop
INDIA:16.2 Lyon to Rohit, no run, turning in from a length on off, shimmies down and is done in for length, blocks it to mid-wicket
INDIA:16.1 Lyon to Dhawan, 1 run, skips down the track looking to take advantage of mid-on being up. But couldn't get under his attempted loft, hits it along the carpet wide of the man who runs across to stop
INDIA:15.6 Faulkner to Rohit, 2 runs, wonder what a century does to you? Well, it makes you stiff for a start. Look at Mitch Marsh dive at third man. His spine was screaming in protest. Short outside off, Rohit waits for it and back-cuts it behind backward point, and then begins the Marsh marathon
INDIA:15.5 Faulkner to Dhawan, 1 run, skiddy back of a length delivery drifting towards leg, clipped behind square down towards fine leg
INDIA:15.4 Faulkner to Dhawan, 2 runs, takes a couple of steps down and mistimes the heave wide of deep mid-wicket. The bat might have slightly twisted in his hands. Gets it in the gap luckily and on top of that fetches a couple
INDIA:15.3 Faulkner to Rohit, 1 run, on the hips and nudged behind square to bring up the century stand
INDIA:15.2 Faulkner to Dhawan, 1 run, short of length delivery on middle and leg, pulled to deep mid-wicket. Kept it all along the carpet
INDIA:15.1 Faulkner to Rohit, 1 run, a gentle drive wide of mid-off to get to the other end. Just feel that the steam has been lost slightly. And sensibly so. Can't keep on going like an out-of-control car. Will eventually explode
INDIA:14.6 Lyon to Rohit, 1 run, drops it slightly short on middle, Rohit rocks back and pulls it hard but straight to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:14.5 Lyon to Dhawan, 1 run, oh he was done in here. Lyon saw him come down and dragged the length back. Dhawan realizes his folly, accepts his undoing and humbly dabs it through the cover region
INDIA:14.4 Lyon to Rohit, 1 run, dances down the track, gets close to both - the length and line - and cheekily flicks it in the air in front of deep mid-wicket for a single

INDIA:13.6 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, short of length delivery outside off, punched to cover
INDIA:13.5 Faulkner to Rohit, FOUR, that needs to be checked. No? Yeah, it's a boundary. Bailey's foot was strolling carelessly on the cushions as he slid to stop. Flicked through mid-wicket, Bailey rushes across and flicks it back. But didn't have his foot in control
INDIA:13.4 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, hops on the crease and steers a back of a length delivery to backward point
INDIA:13.3 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, length ball on the pads, and Rohit has missed out there. Late to get his bat across on the flick, hit on the knee-roll and the ball rolls away into the off-side
INDIA:13.2 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, back of a length delivery angled across off, dabbed to backward point
INDIA:13.1 Faulkner to Dhawan, 1 run, gives the charge too early, gave Faulkner enough time to pull his length back. Still tries to go through with some sort of flat-batted swat, chops it in front of mid-off

INDIA:12.4 Lyon to Dhawan, 1 run, hangs back waiting for it to turn, then guides it past point. Played it close to his body
INDIA:12.3 Lyon to Dhawan, SIX, that's a crackerjack of a half-century. Has kept India right in this one. And what a way to get there. Letting Lyon know who the boss really is. Sits on his back knee premeditating the sweep, gets an ideal length and slaps it way over deep square
INDIA:12.2 Lyon to Dhawan, no run, really well bowled. Got it to grip as well. Tossed up on a length out of Dhawan's defensive reach, turns away from off, Dhawan adjusts well with his hands and pats it towards point
INDIA:12.1 Lyon to Rohit, 1 run, flatter through the air from round the wicket, slants away from a shortish length outside off, chopped in front of short third manNathan Lyon, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
INDIA:11.6 Faulkner to Dhawan, no run, and again. Short of length outside off, steered to backward point. Had taken a couple of steps down while playing the stroke. Evokes a shy at his end. Why can't fielders just hold the ball these days?
INDIA:11.5 Faulkner to Dhawan, no run, oh tried to be cheeky there. With third man up, Dhawan simply opens the bat-face trying to run it to the fence. Picks out the fielder. However, Dhawan's showing that he is not all brash and brute
INDIA:11.4 Faulkner to Rohit, 1 run, shuffles across and clips it off the hips through square leg
INDIA:11.3 Faulkner to Rohit, FOUR, magnificent. Sheer class from Rohit. Not a bad ball at all. Only a fraction full outside off, Rohit doesn't bother moving his front foot too much. Just tilts his upper body forward and punches it past a diving mid-off
INDIA:11.2 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, drops it with soft hands in front of point, checks with his partner on the single. It's not there
INDIA:11.1 Faulkner to Rohit, no run, length ball drifting across off, patted back down the pitch
INDIA:10.6 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, 1 run, again twists nicely on the back foot using it as a fulcrum while helping the pull down to fine leg
INDIA:10.5 Mitchell Marsh to Dhawan, 1 run, width on offer again and it's been slashed to the boundary rider in the off-side

INDIA:8.4 Mitchell Marsh to Dhawan, 1 run, opened the bat face and square drive it towards deep point, sensible batting this!

INDIA:8.2 Mitchell Marsh to Dhawan, SIX, another pick up shot and this one has gone the distance. Going down leg and asking for trouble, Dhawan obliges and dispatches it over the deep square leg fence
INDIA:8.1 Mitchell Marsh to Rohit, 1 run, turns this length delivery past square leg for a singleMitchell Marsh, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:7.6 Boland to Dhawan, no run, safely defended into the off-side
INDIA:7.5 Boland to Dhawan, FOUR, another heart-in-the-mouth moment for Dhawan. It was slinging down leg and Dhawan plays his favourite stroke - pick up shot that is. The fielder at deep backward square was 10-15 yards inside and had he stayed closer to the boundary, it would have been a simple catch. Shaun Marsh was the man. He backtracks and leaps but to no avail
INDIA:7.4 Boland to Dhawan, no run, length delivery just outside off, Dhawan chops it towards cover
INDIA:7.3 Boland to Rohit, 1 run, got a leading edge as he tried to work it through the on-side. To his delight, it lobbed well in front of backward point

INDIA:7.1 Boland to Rohit, FOUR, "PPPLLLAAAAYYEED" screamed Rohit's fan in the comm. box here. Mr. Sagar Chawla from Mumbai and he had every reason to admire this man who hails from the same city. Full on the pads, Rohit whips and ensures and he got it wide of mid-on
INDIA:6.6 Hastings to Dhawan, no run, plays with a slightly angled bat but couldn't thread the gap at backward point
INDIA:6.5 Hastings to Dhawan, FOUR, wow! You can superimpose David Warner over that shot. Came down the track and flayed that over the infield on the off-side. All timing and placement. It was an uppish drive over cover and no one moved!
INDIA:6.4 Hastings to Dhawan, no run, another fluent drive but straight to the stubby-armed Warner at mid-off
INDIA:6.3 Hastings to Dhawan, no run, just opened the bat face and looked for the gap behind Lyon at backward point, but it went straight to Lyon
INDIA:6.2 Hastings to Dhawan, 2 runs, leading edge! Still safe though. Dhawan was a fraction too early on the uppish punch/cut. The ball held a bit on the pitch and draws the leading edge from Dhawan which rolls down to third man
INDIA:6.1 Hastings to Dhawan, SIX, well! How about that? Just stand and admire. Straight into the stands. Dhawan picked the length, cleared his front leg and slogged it over the cow-corner fence

INDIA:5.5 Boland to Rohit, no run, driven gently towards the man at mid-on
INDIA:5.4 Boland to Dhawan, 1 run, outside edge and safe! This wasn't that short but Dhawan opts to pull from the crease. Eked out a thick top edge which flies over a non-existent short third man. He could have had his heart in his mouth
INDIA:5.3 Boland to Dhawan, FOUR, brilliant! Raced down the track and manufactured some room for himself. Opened the bat face slightly to slot it between cover and backward point. All about placement that shot!
INDIA:5.2 Boland to Rohit, 1 run, 132kmph targetting the top of off. Rohit brings out his rubber-esque wrists into play, turned towards mid-wicket

INDIA:4.4 Hastings to Dhawan, no run, this wasn't outside off but Dhawan decided to cut this anyway. Backed away and was cramped for room and could only place it to backward point
INDIA:4.3 Hastings to Rohit, 1 run, hurled in on the stumps, Rohit looks to block off the front foot. Manages to squeeze it off the inside half towards mid-on
INDIA:4.2 Hastings to Rohit, no run, shortish outside off, Rohit punches but picks Lyon this time
INDIA:4.1 Hastings to Rohit, FOUR, shot Rohit! When he times it that well there is very little any oppostion could do. Saw the width and square drove it beating Lyon's dive at backward point
INDIA:3.6 Boland to Dhawan, no run, length outside off, punched to cover-point
INDIA:3.5 Boland to Dhawan, 2 runs, that shot was all about sheer timing. Allows the ball to angle in and then closed the bat face on the drive, wide of mid-on and off for a couple
INDIA:3.4 Boland to Dhawan, no run, aggression from Dhawan but to no avail. Dances down the track looking to bludgeon it over cover, beaten on the under edge
INDIA:3.3 Boland to Dhawan, 2 runs, wristily turns this wide of mid-wicket to nab a duo of runs
INDIA:3.2 Boland to Dhawan, no run, short and wide, Dhawan flashes hard and misses. This one too shaped away a tad but Dhawan's feet was going nowhere

INDIA:2.3 Hastings to Rohit, no run, shortish with ample width, Rohit times the cut but Lyon at backward point kills all the timing on that shot, by putting a valiant dive to his left
INDIA:2.2 Hastings to Dhawan, 1 run, dab-and-run cricket from India. Dhawan drops it to the off-side and sprints across for a quick single. Hastings got to the ball quickly, but lost his balance. Slides and rifles an awkward throw at the bowler's end. Had that hit Dhawan was a goner
INDIA:2.1 Hastings to Dhawan, 2 runs, short of length and sat up nicely for Dhawan who punches it wide of cover for a couple of runs
INDIA:1.6 Boland to Rohit, no run, this one swung away late, that too from a good length. Rohit was trying to punch but the swing took it away from his flashing blade
INDIA:1.5 Boland to Rohit, no run, gets forward and across to dead-bat this length delivery towards the off-side
INDIA:1.4 Boland to Dhawan, 1 run, leg-sidish delivery from Boland and Dhawan is content with a single behind square leg
INDIA:1.3 Boland to Dhawan, no run, that's a nice one! Pitched on an ideal (good) length and got it to shape away late, Dhawan is lucky as he played inside the line, missed the outside edge by some distance
INDIA:1.2 Boland to Dhawan, no run, hits the deck hard at 135ks. Dhawan was trying to work it square on the leg-side, misses and is hit high on the pads

INDIA:0.3 Hastings to Dhawan, no run, offers a bit of width outside off, Dhawan cuts but cannot get it past backward point
INDIA:0.2 Hastings to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit mistimed his cut and took off for a quick single. Towards cover where Bailey gets across and has a shy at the bowler's end, Rohit was well in though. Well-judged single that!
INDIA:0.1 Hastings to Rohit, no run, gentle good length outswinger around off, didn't do much in the air and therefore Rohit could block it under his eyesRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. Hastings will open the attackWell! Against all odd predictions, there's no rain and is expected to be the same till the end of the game. But, what was that from Mitch Marsh. Flat-batting strokes all over the ground. Must have drawn some attention from Australian Open as well. Okay! Let's get back to cricket. John Hastings to Rohit Sharma with two slips in place...Oh India, India. MS Dhoni must be wondering what sins he has committed to bear such brutality. Initially, the winds seemed to have changed direction with the visitors making quick dents after electing to bowl. Jasprit Bumrah, the debutant, raised some eyebrows of those who haven't seen his unorthodox action, and then he forced us all to raise our hands in applause. An absolute brilliant spell of bowling - stuff of dreams. However, none of the others could compliment him. Soon, M Marsh joined hands with Warner and handed out a pasting worth remembering - both going on to complete tons. However, the visitors have done well to pull things back. 81 runs came off the final 10 which is an appreciable effort. Could have really got out of hand with a score of 350-plus on the cards. But now can they chase it? Well, they weren't successful with a lesser target in the World Cup semifinal at this very venue. Not going to get any easier. We'll wait and watch..SCG started as a benevolent host, turned into a hot cauldron and metamorphosed into a fire-breathing two-horned dragon for India. Oh jeez, Mitch Marsh has played an absolute blinder here. He was perhaps the only glitch in Australia's well-oiled steam-engine. And now he's slapped the pulp out of this Indian bowling attack.4
AUSTRALIA:49.6 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, fine delivery to end the innings. It has been a superb last over from Ishant. Just the 4 runs off it. Yorker aimed at the base of middle, Marsh squeezes it in front of square on the leg-side, there was a chance of a second. But the pair don't go for it. Virat goes up to Marsh and congratulates him when the players were walking off the field
AUSTRALIA:49.5 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, no run, another cleverly bowled off-cutter, Marsh is looking to target the deep mid-wicket, swoops low and is ages early into the heave, fails to connect and is struck on the back, the ball dribbles back to Ishant
AUSTRALIA:49.4 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, no run, oh! That would have hurt. Marsh backs away to the leg-side, Ishant slips in the slower one, Marsh bent down to slog it to cow corner, missed and takes a blow on the box. He grimaces in pain and Ishant walks up to check on him. He is fine though
AUSTRALIA:49.3 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, there it is! Mitchell Marsh has his maiden ODI hundred. Look at him go. Completes the second and immediately takes off his helmet. Waves his bat to all corners of the ground. The older brother is delighted, he is on his feet applauding. So is the entire Aussie dressing room. Marsh also lets out a roar. Coming to the ball, full and on the pads, flicked to deep mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:49.2 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, no run, Marsh is stranded on 99. He is looking as a bundle of nerves. Nothing but a back of a length delivery, Marsh looks to swipe it across the line, misses and the ball goes over the sticks
AUSTRALIA:49.1 Ishant to Hastings, leg byes, 1 run, slower delivery on the legs, Hastings fails to meet with the glance, the ball takes the pads and Dhoni allows the ball to escape. The duo don't risk the secondIshant Sharma [9.0-0-57-2] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:48.6 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, no run, low full toss and on off, Marsh drives it to mid-on. Good field placement from Dhoni. Kohli was in saving the single and hence the pair couldn't go through. Top spell from Bumrah, finishes with figures: 10-0-40-2
AUSTRALIA:48.5 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, no run, another well-directed yorker, right on the base of off-stump, Marsh digs it back to the bowler
AUSTRALIA:48.4 Bumrah to Hastings, 1 run, once more too full and almost yorker length, Hastings squeezes it to mid-off, only a single available

AUSTRALIA:48.2 Bumrah to Hastings, 1 run, very full and on off, Hastings works it to mid-wicket and gets Marsh back on strikeJohn Hastings, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:48.1 Bumrah to Faulkner, out Bowled!! Cleaned 'im up. Damien Martyn just stole my words as he said, "Take a bow." It has been a dream debut for Bumrah. The perfect yorker, Faulkner was in the hitting mood, goes for the drive, the ball sneaks under the bat and crashes into the off-stump. Dhoni was also impressed as he applauded. Faulkner b Bumrah 1(3)Bumrah to Faulkner, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Jasprit Bumrah [9.0-0-37-1] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:47.6 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, low full toss on middle and leg, Marsh clips it wide of long-on, called for two immediately and with Faulkner's fresh legs it was always on. He is on 98

AUSTRALIA:47.4 U Yadav to Faulkner, no run, fuller and around off, Faulkner pushes it gently to coverJames Faulkner, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:47.3 U Yadav to Wade, out Caught by Dhoni!! Something for Yadav to cheer about. However, Wade has done his job. Got a quickfire 36 and has left it to Finisher Faulkner to finish off the innings. Angled well outside off, might have been a wide had Wade let go, instead he went chasing and the outside edge is snaffled by Dhoni. No celebrations from the Indians. In fact, they didn't even appeal. Wade c Dhoni b U Yadav 36(27) [4s-2 6s-1]U Yadav to Wade, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:47.2 U Yadav to Wade, SIX, Yadav keeps dishing out rubbish and keeps disappearing. Why would you bowl a slower one on leg-stump with a short leg-side boundary? Hard for me to understand. Wade helps it along the way over backward square for a maximum
AUSTRALIA:47.1 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, that made a cracking sound when ball made contact with the bat. Fullish and just outside off, Marsh makes room and drives it along the ground to sweeper coverUmesh Yadav [7.0-0-72-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:46.6 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, very full and just outside off, Marsh squeezes the drive to extra cover, riskly single taken. A direct hit would have made things interesting at the bowler's end
AUSTRALIA:46.5 Ishant to Wade, 1 run, full and attacking the stumps, eased down to long-on
AUSTRALIA:46.4 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, another low full toss and umpire Richard Kettleborough thought he was in the firing line once again. Remember what happened in the last ODI? Finch nailed Kettleborough's ankle. Thanks to Ishant's boot, he is safe. Marsh smashed down the ground, the ball deflected off Ishant's right boot
AUSTRALIA:46.3 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, another one that is thumped down the ground. He is into the 90s and has recorded his highest ODI score. A ton up for grabs. Low full toss just outside off, Marsh drives it past Ishant, who tries to put his hand out. Long-off had no chance
AUSTRALIA:46.2 Ishant to Wade, 3 runs, 120ks off-cuter. It almost cramped Wade for room, but he still manages to get the pull over the leaping square leg fielder, Marsh pushes for the third to keep strike
AUSTRALIA:46.1 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, wide full delivery, well outside off. Marsh bends down and squeezes it with an angled bat square on the off-sideIshant Sharma [8.0-0-46-2] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:45.6 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, very full and on the stumps, Marsh drives it to long-on and retains strike
AUSTRALIA:45.5 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, that hardly took off, couple of bounces and into the rope. The steward sitting outside has been pinged on the thigh. Please someone stop Marsh, he is hurting people. Slower delivery which is short, Marsh hammers it over extra cover, not a muscle moved
AUSTRALIA:45.4 R Dhawan to Wade, 1 run, widish yorker, Wade jams it in front of extra cover and crosses over to the other end
AUSTRALIA:45.3 R Dhawan to Wade, 2 runs, the cross-seam delivery, on a fuller length, Wade reaches out for it and drills the drive to deep extra cover, the other Dhawan had some yards to cover, he got there and kept it to a brace

AUSTRALIA:45.1 R Dhawan to Wade, 1 run, takes the pace off this short of length delivery, slapped to long-off for a single, back to MarshDhoni has a word with Rishi Dhawan. Last 5 overs, how much can Australia get?
AUSTRALIA:44.6 Bumrah to Wade, leg byes, 1 run, low full toss on the legs, Wade can't meet with the glance, ball takes the pad on the way to fine leg
AUSTRALIA:44.5 Bumrah to Wade, no run, another yorker speared on the stumps, Wade is quick to take his front leg out of the way and squeeze it to the on-side. That is what we call a toe-crusher!
AUSTRALIA:44.4 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, lovely comeback from Bumrah, is he playing his first game? Right in the blockhole, Marsh can't do much about that, digs it to long-on
AUSTRALIA:44.3 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, SIX, that has been bullied! Mitchell Marsh is called the Bison in the Aussie dressing and that is for this reason. He has murdered that short of length delivery, sat up nicely for Marsh who pulls it flat over deep mid-wicket. A spectator tries to catch and hurts himself. Why would you do that? He is grimacing in pain
AUSTRALIA:44.2 Bumrah to Wade, 1 run, off-pace delivery just outside off, Wade uses his wrists to nudge it square on the leg-side
AUSTRALIA:44.1 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Marsh muscles it down to long-offJasprit Bumrah [8.0-0-28-1] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:43.6 R Dhawan to Wade, 2 runs, that would have been a wide. But Wade decided to have a go at it. Full toss well outside off, Wade reaches out and slices it past the diving backward point fielder. Sweeper tidies up and the batsmen collect two more. An over that looked good in terms of line and length went for 12
AUSTRALIA:43.5 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, low full toss on off, Marsh hammers it along the floor to long-off
AUSTRALIA:43.4 R Dhawan to Wade, 3 runs, Wade premeditates a lot. Moves across and stoops low, scoops it over short fine. Didn't get off the middle and hence Bumrah was able to hunt the ball down, easy three
AUSTRALIA:43.3 R Dhawan to Wade, FOUR, bad delivery and punished. 107ks slower one which is dragged halfway down, Wade clears his front leg and mows it over mid-wicket, no one in the deep to stop that from reaching the fence
AUSTRALIA:43.2 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, slower ball bouncer. Marsh fetched it from over his head, forehanded the pull to deep mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:43.1 R Dhawan to Wade, 1 run, low full toss outside off, Wade stretches forward and drives to long-off, almost came off the base of the bat
AUSTRALIA:42.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Wade, 1 run, bit more flight on this one, Wade moves away to the leg-side and drills it to long-on. Jadeja finishes an economical spell, would have been better had he got a wicket to his name. His figures read: 10-0-46-0
AUSTRALIA:42.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Wade, 2 runs, Wade was on his knee even before Jadeja started his run-up, paddles it round the corner and sprints back for the second
AUSTRALIA:42.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, Marsh was backing away and Jadeja fires in a low full toss, driven down to long-off
AUSTRALIA:42.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Wade, 1 run, flatter and just outside off, punched off the back foot to long-off

AUSTRALIA:42.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, Marsh is going to target that short leg-side boundary. Kneels down and slog sweeps it along the carpet to deep mid-wicket, didn't get hold of it
AUSTRALIA:41.6 R Dhawan to Wade, no run, keeps the slower one on a length, Wade closes the bat face and knocks it to down the wicket, Dhawan mock throws at the striker's end
AUSTRALIA:41.5 R Dhawan to Wade, FOUR, unlucky! That didn't deserve a boundary. Slanted well across the left-hander, Wade goes chasing after it, the toe-end goes fine and beats third man with ease
AUSTRALIA:41.4 R Dhawan to Wade, no run, another off-speed delivery, Wade is ages early into the drive, is beaten and the ball goes on the bounce to Dhoni
AUSTRALIA:41.3 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, change-up from Dhawan. Marsh was winding up for the big hit, has to adjust and does so with a nudge down to long-on
AUSTRALIA:41.2 R Dhawan to Wade, 1 run, fullish and outside off, Wade opens the bat face and drives towards backward point, Yadav dives to his right and saves a couple of runs
AUSTRALIA:41.1 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, back of a length around off, punched off the back foot to sweeper coverDhawan is asking Wade to stand outside the turf. However, the non-striker can stand where he is right now - right on the edge of the pitch.. No idea why Dhawan wants him to run outside
AUSTRALIA:41.1 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, wide, starts his new spell with one down leg, Marsh walked across to flick, doesn't connect and another extra added to the totalRishi Dhawan [7.0-0-44-1] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:40.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Wade, no run, floated up on the fourth stump, Wade drives and finds cover
AUSTRALIA:40.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, Dhoni is happy with the single, also the line and length from Jadeja. Pushed through around off, Marsh steers it to the left of backward point, only a single available
AUSTRALIA:40.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, Marsh has started to show his range now. Waited for this one, cut it late and placed it behind square on the off-side, no chance for sweeper to stop that
AUSTRALIA:40.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, no run, fired into the blockhole, Marsh squeezes it back to Jaddu
AUSTRALIA:40.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Wade, 1 run, shortens the length around off, punched to deep backward point

AUSTRALIA:40.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Wade, no run, flatter and just outside off, Wade looks to force it off the back foot, missed and Dhoni doesn't glove the ball cleanly eitherRavindra Jadeja [8.0-0-33-0] is back into the attackWe are into the third powerplay. Five fielders can be outside the ring. Dhoni has to somehow get four overs out of Rishi Dhawan and Umesh Yadav.. Let's see how that goes..
AUSTRALIA:39.6 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, slower ball which ends up on the pads, wristed wide of long-on. Hoverboards back for a couple
AUSTRALIA:39.5 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, oh intimidating. Transfers his weight on the back foot after the initial stride forward after seeing the length early, pulls it forcefully behind square and in the gap
AUSTRALIA:39.4 U Yadav to Wade, 1 run, stays flat-footed to remain leg-side of the short of length delivery leaving him, pats it away past point
AUSTRALIA:39.3 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, length ball around off, flogged down to long-on
AUSTRALIA:39.2 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, brilliant batting this. It's not a shot played in anger. Just timing. Similar full ball hoping for reverse swing. There isn't a considerable amount. Marsh stomps beside the line of the ball and plays a lavish punchy-drive straight of mid-off (who had been brought up before this ball)
AUSTRALIA:39.1 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, pitched up and tailing in on off, he plays a lofted punch down the ground. To the right of long-off who has a fair distance to cover. Can't prevent twoUmesh Yadav [6.0-0-58-0] is back into the attackRight, Dhoni's gone back to Yadav.
AUSTRALIA:38.6 Ishant to Wade, no run, hangs back to a short of length delivery and blocksMatthew Wade, left handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:38.5 Ishant to Warner, out Caught by Ravindra Jadeja!! It's over. All the butchery, the carnage, the bullying. Ishant's brought India some much needed breathing space. A well disguised off-cutter, bowled it on a back of a length outside off. Warner had to manufacture all the pace on his own as he tried to hoist it off the back-foot over extra-cover. Ends up slicing it off the outside-edge towards backward point. Jadeja moves to his right and clasps it before tumbling over. Warner c Ravindra Jadeja b Ishant 122(113) [4s-9 6s-3]Ishant to Warner, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:38.4 Ishant to Warner, no run, fiery low full toss outside off, hammered straight to mid-off
AUSTRALIA:38.3 Ishant to Warner, FOUR, oh too easy. Overcooked the yorker and dished out a full toss outside off, Warner might have actually converted it into one by advancing, slashes it over extra-cover
AUSTRALIA:38.2 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, leg byes, 1 run, completely hoodwinks Marsh as he wound up on the pull. He's through with the shot too early not reading the slower bouncer. Deflects off his rib-cage behind point
AUSTRALIA:38.1 Ishant to Warner, 1 run, well bowled. Harpooned into the blockhole after seeing Warner backing away, squirted in front of cover
AUSTRALIA:37.6 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, no run, low full toss drilled to mid-off
AUSTRALIA:37.5 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, no run, a very awkward short of length delivery to deal with, twists and turns off the pitch as it was a leg-cutter, Marsh stands tall attempting to fend it off. Splices it down the pitch. Popped up in the air for a while before dropping down
AUSTRALIA:37.4 Bumrah to Warner, 1 run, slower back of a length delivery on the pads, clipped through mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:37.3 Bumrah to Warner, no run, the centurion receives the shock of his life. Oh he nearly went into trauma did Warner upon seeing the high full toss. Tried to slog it away but is pounded on the splice. His bat went flying out of his hands and over the stumps. Warner himself dropped on the floor. Might have wrecked the willow as well. Yes, he is changing his bat 
AUSTRALIA:37.2 Bumrah to Warner, 2 runs, backs away looking to flay one through the off-side, but it's a brilliant delivery. Speared into the blockhole. Somehow manages to squeeze it fine of third man
AUSTRALIA:37.1 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, pats this leg-cutter in front of mid-off and skates to the other end to bring up a well jotted fifty. The good thing about this knock has been that unlike Canberra, he has never allowed the momentum to slack
AUSTRALIA:36.6 Ishant to Warner, no run, tries to stay leg-side of a short of length delivery just outside off, slightly cramped for room as he forces it to backward point
AUSTRALIA:36.5 Ishant to Warner, SIX, disdainful. That's more like a butcher than a cricketer. Utter disrespect. Perfectly on a good length on off, clears his front leg and clubs it through the line straight back over. Clunked into the advertising boards
AUSTRALIA:36.4 Ishant to Warner, 2 runs, on a good length outside off, might have been an off-cutter, shuffles across and works it wide of long-onChange in helmets for Warner. To raise his temper I assume
AUSTRALIA:36.3 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, punched on the rise through the cover region. Leaned towards the back of a length delivery after moving inches forward and hit it in the gap for the single
AUSTRALIA:36.2 Ishant to Warner, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, chopped in front of cover for a single
AUSTRALIA:36.1 Ishant to Warner, FOUR, slotted through extra-cover. Watch out India. This man is going to unload I feel. Lines up the good length delivery outside off, opens his stance and creams the drive on the up. Didn't bother to keep it down. Didn't need toIshant Sharma [6.0-0-27-1] is back into the attackUmesh Yadav's horror show has left Dhoni struggling again. Can't see him completing his overs. Who do India turn to? A slight hold-up in play at the moment. Can't decipher the reason. There are a couple of Aussie substitutes gathered around Warner. Re-hydration maybe?
AUSTRALIA:35.6 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, swivels on the back foot, rolls his wrists on the ball and pulls it wide of deep backward square
AUSTRALIA:35.5 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, no run, short of length delivery on middle, he defends it off the front foot. Imposing
AUSTRALIA:35.4 Bumrah to Warner, 1 run, knocked back down the pitch, deflects off the stumps at the other end down to long-on
AUSTRALIA:35.3 Bumrah to Warner, 2 runs, he's done it! Maiden ODI hundred against India for David Warner. Removes his helmet, does his traditional leaping gig and punches the air in delight. There's no stopping him. Glided it behind backward point and scampered across. Always going to come back for two. And then dedicates it to his recently born second daughter doing a little cradle gesture
AUSTRALIA:35.2 Bumrah to Warner, no run, still can't get it away. Warner's getting twitchy now. Back of a length delivery outside off, punched to cover where Pandey is synonymous with a wall
AUSTRALIA:35.1 Bumrah to Warner, no run, loopy slower ball, bounces spongily from a good length outside off, Warner chops his drive to cover
AUSTRALIA:34.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, no run, a bit more and sliding on towards off from a length, forward and defended
AUSTRALIA:34.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Warner, 1 run, drops it slightly short and is pulled away behind square. Straight to the deep fielder though
AUSTRALIA:34.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, flatter outside off, plays a cross-batted drive through the cover region
AUSTRALIA:34.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Warner, 1 run, fullish on middle and leg, wristed down to long-on
AUSTRALIA:34.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, Jadeja's up in appeal. Not sure why. He clearly got a bottom edge there. Misread the length and attempted to sweep a very full ball. Gets it away to short fine leg
AUSTRALIA:34.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, that's arrogantly chipped over Jadeja's head. Fullish and drifting in on middle, Marsh plonks his front leg beside the line and lifts it cheekily
AUSTRALIA:33.6 Bumrah to Warner, no run, attempts to flat-bat the pull away reading the length early. But it hurries onto him, hits high on the bat and lumbers away to mid-on
AUSTRALIA:33.5 Bumrah to Warner, no run, slippery back of a length delivery aiming for the top of off, Warner hurries to get his bat down and blocks
AUSTRALIA:33.4 Bumrah to Warner, no run, back of a length delivery around middle, clipped to mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:33.3 Bumrah to Warner, no run, there's something about Bumrah that has messed up the timing of most Aussies. Perhaps the unusual action, perhaps the zip of the pitch. Pitched up just outside off, jabbed to mid-on
AUSTRALIA:33.2 Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, skiddy. Hurries on from a good length outside off, takes the inside edge of Marsh's defence and dribbles away through square leg
AUSTRALIA:33.1 Bumrah to Warner, 1 run, clears his front leg and laces this full ball straight of mid-off. Ishant runs round and slides to cut it off but Warner was already through to the other end when he got upJasprit Bumrah [5.0-0-17-1] is back into the attackDrinks are on the field now! India must be wondering what do they need to do? They had Australia in a really precarious position at 117/4. But now even Mitch Marsh has stepped up and got himself involved in a better-than-run-a-ball partnership with the brutal Warner. The same Mitch Marsh who's looked completely out of sorts.
AUSTRALIA:32.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, no run, so quick, so flat, so Jadeja. Punched to extra-cover
AUSTRALIA:32.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Warner, 1 run, quicker and flatter on the hips, turned round the corner and through the infield

AUSTRALIA:32.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Warner, no run, darted on middle, tucked to mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:32.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Warner, no run, flatter on middle, pushed down the pitch to Jadeja's left. He isn't letting that past him

AUSTRALIA:31.6 U Yadav to Warner, 1 run, short of length delivery slanted away outside off, slapped to deep cover
AUSTRALIA:31.5 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, my goodness, he's blasted this pull away. So unlucky to slot it straight to deep square leg
AUSTRALIA:31.4 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, atrocious stuff from Yadav. He's been guilty of this far too often. Attempts a slower ball and drops it short outside off, Marsh blazes the cut square of the wicket
AUSTRALIA:31.3 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, SIX, pulled and that's gone! For a moment, I thought it came right off the top edge. But it kept sailing and ended up 5-10 rows back over fine leg. Another poor short ball, no purpose, no venom. Ends up around the mid-riff region. Marsh swivels across and hammers it away
AUSTRALIA:31.2 U Yadav to Warner, 3 runs, oh bullish! Stands tall and whips this short of length delivery through mid-wicket with a cracking short-arm pull. Rohit sprints to his right, puts in a valiant dive, and just about manages to flick the ball inside avoiding contact with the cushionsWell this is funky to put it best. Widish slip in place for Warner as well. Perhaps taking into account the outside edge in the previous over
AUSTRALIA:31.1 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, slower ball on a good length outside off, driven on the up to deep coverDhoni and his heir-apparent are having a long discussion. Still at it. Results in a field change somewhere near deep mid-wicket. Kohli himself stands at slip
AUSTRALIA:30.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, another round-arm dart, which ends up on leg, clipped through mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:30.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Warner, 1 run, darted on middle and leg from over the wicket, tucked away through the mid-wicket region. Placed it in the gap on this occasion, not in Pandey's vicinity
AUSTRALIA:30.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Warner, no run, clipped of the pads wide of mid-wicket where Pandey has been brilliant. All day really. Throws himself to his left and stops

AUSTRALIA:30.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, no run, lot more air from Jadeja, Marsh prods across and blocks to extra-cover

AUSTRALIA:29.5 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, no run, Marsh opens the bat face to dab this to the left of backward point. RJ gets across to try and prevent a single
AUSTRALIA:29.4 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, short and wide! Marsh pounced on it, placing the cut through cover

AUSTRALIA:29.2 U Yadav to Warner, 1 run, Warner rises on his tippy toes to flick this behind square leg
AUSTRALIA:29.1 U Yadav to Warner, FOUR, outside edge and safe! "Lucky boundary" as VVS describes it on air. On a length and swung away from Warner who has a waft. Eked out a thick outside edge which flies well wide of MS, down to the third man fenceUmesh Yadav [4.0-0-28-0] is back into the attackYadav is back and so is my favourite cricket commentator on air. MARK NICHOLAS that is...

AUSTRALIA:27.6 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, no run, back of a length on leg, Marsh tucks to the right of mid-wicket where VK gets across to field
AUSTRALIA:27.5 R Dhawan to Warner, 1 run, feeding full and wide stuff to Warner! How do you describe that? I would say a cardinal sin. Dhawan must brace himself though as Warner mistimed his drive towards deep cover. Went hard on the shot and hence got the timing wrong
AUSTRALIA:27.4 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, that's the way to do it Marshy! Stand still and time the punch through cover, as simple as that
AUSTRALIA:27.3 R Dhawan to Warner, 1 run, curling in around off from a fuller length, Warner drills the drive to long-off

AUSTRALIA:27.1 R Dhawan to Warner, FOUR, that should have been a wide! But Warner won't mind. When he's in that kind of mood, he won't spare any. Does he? Slower fullish delivery well wide of off. Warner shuffles across and late-cuts behind backward point. Placed it to perfection!

AUSTRALIA:23.6 Gurkeerat Singh to Warner, 1 run, milked a single down to long-on

Finch is on strike. Ishant will open the attackIshant steams in, two slips in place..The sun has made an appearence as the players come out into the middle. There's a lot to play for the visitors. A 5-0 whitewash is always an embarassment and Dhoni's men wouldn't like it one bit, there's something else to play for. If India lose today, they will slip from No.2 to No. 3 in the ICC ODI rankings.Teams:India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Manish Pandey, MS Dhoni(w/c), Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Ravindra Jadeja, Rishi Dhawan, Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Ishant SharmaAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, John Hastings, Scott Boland, Nathan LyonSmith: "We have got a few changes for this game. Shaun Marsh is in as Maxwell has got a slight hamstring strain. Scott Boland gets an opportunity in place of the rested Kane Richardson. We chased extremely well in the first three games and we pulled it back nicely with the ball in the last game. It does look like a nice wicket. Hopefully we can bat well and post a good score."Dhoni: "We will bowl first. We have not got a lot of experience. Maybe the batsmen will have to take a bit more responsibility and score a few extra runs. Though we have lost all 4 games, we have been improving. Rahane and Bhuvi are injured. Pandey and the debutant Bumrah are in."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldMeanwhile, some grey-looking clouds have gathered overhead again as we gear up for the toss. Hovering like those loan-sharks - you can never tell when they will turn rogue.Injuries might force a change or two in both teams. Glenn Maxwell is a doubtful starter today after damaging his knee while batting in the previous encounter. So it will be Shaun Marsh I presume taking his place. Oh the woeful world of Shaun Marsh. Poor sod. Only gets a chance when someone else is ruled out. What does he need to do to engrave his place in this XI. I wonder. Meanwhile, even India have worries of their own. Rahane split his webbing while fielding in Canberra, so can't see him playing today. Another chance for someone like Pandey maybe? Also, traditionally the SCG has suited spin more than most other pitches Down Under. Ashwin might find himself getting another opportunity. Or maybe Dhoni might just decide to load up on his spin department and pick Axar too. Who knows! Okay wait, I am being informed that Jasprit Bumrah has been handed his ODI cap.12:20 Local Time, 02:20 GMT, 07:50 IST: Welcome all. It's 4-0 to Australia as we enter the SCG to close out what has been a rather strange series. Strange I say because the scoreline might seem a little harsh on the visitors. They haven't been all that bad after all. At least the batting hasn't - save for a ridiculous collapse or two. But then, that's how good this Aussie lineup is. Heck, they can't accomodate a certain Usman Khawaja who, at the moment, isn't SCORING runs. He's ENCHANTING them. There was some light rain in Sydney around half an hour ago which has cleared. Shouldn't be any kind of delay with the sun bursting through now.Preview by Vishaal LoganathanWell, not 'lift gloom' as in take the rains away, but certainly the gloom that surrounds Team India following four back-to-back losses against hosts Australia in the ongoing One-Day International series. With thunderstorms predicted for Saturday (January 23), the game in Sydney could be marred by rain, but it would also rob India of their chance to claim some small solaces in what has been a tough tour so far. India 'playing for pride' and Australia 'aiming to be ruthless', may just be just cliches, but they certainly ring true.India's last 5-0 drubbing came at the hands of a legendary West Indies team in 1988-89, and although this series has not been as one-sided as the one against the mighty Caribbean unit, India will be desperate to avoid that scoreline. Australia, on the other hand, will want to keep their winning momentum going and pound the visitors into the ground ahead of the Twenty20 Internationals.Match DetailsDate and Time: January 23, 2016; 14:20 Local Time, 08:50 ISTWeather: 25 degrees, thunderstorms predictedVenue: Sydney Cricket GroundIndiaIndia's top three, after Shikhar Dhawan's fifty in Melbourne and hundred in Canberra, pick themselves. The problem starts at No 4. Ajinkya Rahane suffered an injury to his right hand in Canberra and could miss out on the final game at Sydney. The injury to the right-hander leaves the side in a bit of a quandary. Manish Pandey should come in Rahane's place, but who will take his slot in the batting order is the more important aspect. Mahendra Singh Dhoni coming up the order would leave Pandey and Gurukeerat Singh Mann at five and six, and that makes the lower-middle order brittle. Pandey could move up to No. 4 leaving Dhoni, Mann and Ravindra Jadeja to add the finishing touches, if needed.R Ashwin's ouster from the side for the last two games have created a bit of flutter, and Sydney should see the return of the off-spinner. Bhuvneshwar Kumar could face the axe after his disappointing performance in the 4th ODI. Axar Patel has failed to get into the starting XI in the series, and could just get to play in Jadeja's place.AustraliaWith the series closed out and more important games coming up, Australia might use the opportunity to rest a few players. Mitchell Marsh coming up to bat at No. 3 raised a few eyebrows in Canberra, and the all-rounder could get another audition higher up. Glenn Maxwell, who suffered a bruised knee in the last game, will, if sources are to be believed, miss the Sydney game.Nathan Lyon had a sub-par outing on his return to the limited-overs side, and he would want to ensure he puts in a stronger performance this time around, while Scott Boland will hope to make a more powerful impression should he get the chance to replace Kane Richardson or John Hastings.Quotes:"We've played good cricket so far. I know we have not capitalized in the important moments but I feel we've been very competitive on the field" - Virat Kohli."We desperately want to win 5-0. If you can get a little advantage over your opposition at home - there have been times when we've gone over to India and they've had the wood on us over there. So we're definitely looking to go 5-0, that's a massive priority for us" - John Hastings.Teams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Manish Pandey, Axar Patel, Rishi Dhawan, Barinder SranAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, John Hastings, Nathan Lyon, Kane Richardson, Shaun Marsh, Scott BolandLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
