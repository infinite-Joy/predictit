Eranga will open the attackWelcome back..Good effort from Sri Lanka to post 250+ after losing a couple of early wickets. Thirimanne was the person who consolidated and scored a half century, giving a good base for the lower middle order. Mahela jaywardene played a classy knock and with the help of Chandimal, took SL to a 250+ score. Let's see if Australia can chase this down and qualify. Stay tuned for the chase.Here are the equations that matter: Australia need to chase this down in 29.1 overs or less to qualify. Sri Lanka just need a win and they will be through. If Sri Lanka restrict Australia to 164 or less, they will top the group.4

This was quick and angled in, pitched on good length and skidded on, Perera went back and looked to play across but missed it. Impact was on middle and leg, and it might have hit leg stump.

Mitchell Johnson will open the attackRight, we're done with the anthems. Time for action now.The teams are coming out to the ground for the national anthems.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews(c), Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Shaminda Eranga, Lasith MalingaAustralia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Matthew Wade(w), Phillip Hughes, George Bailey(c), Adam Voges, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, James Faulkner, Clint McKay, Xavier DohertyMathews: "I am glad that the weather is a bit warmer today. I would have batted first as there is a bit of rain later on. We need to play to our strengths. We are playing the same team."Bailey: "We have to go out and give our best shot. We will bowl first. We need to know the equation and it will be easier to progress. We are playing the same team. We need to bowl really well."Australia have won the toss and elected to fieldHello and welcome to the last group match between Australia and Sri Lanka. Three teams are still in the fray for that elusive spot in the semi finals. Australia need to win by a big margin, while a win will be sufficient for Sri Lanka. The Kiwis should pray for an Aussie win as their net run rate is higher than that of Sri Lanka. Michael Clarke was hopeful of playing today, but he has been ruled out of this match.Preview:Two time defending champions Australia will have to put David Warner's bar brawl controversy and questions surrounding their team culture behind them when they take on Sri Lanka in their final league fixture at The Oval. While it is a straight-forward equation for Sri Lanka, who have to win to qualify, Australia need to win big to better New Zealand's net run-rate to get through to the next stage. Brendon McCullum and his team will also be following this game keenly as a wash-out or a narrow Australian win will help the Black-Caps qualify for the semi-final.Sri Lanka:Sri Lanka's recent success against Australia will provide a psychological edge to them - in the last 10 ODIs played between the two sides, Sri Lanka have won six while they drew the ODI series 2-2 earlier this year in Australia. Sri Lanka have a nice batting unit in big three - Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene - and a lot will depend on them in deciding the outcome of the match. Their batsmen fired in unison against England in the last match with the likes of Dilshan, Jayawardene and Nuwan Kulasekara among the run-makers. On the bowling front, Malinga would need some good back-up from Shaminda Eranga and Rangana Herath to cause damage to the fragile Australian line-up. In this CT: Sri Lanka were skittled out for a paltry 138 against New Zealand in their tournament-opener but a superb bowling show by slinger Lasith Malinga saw them very nearly defend the total before losing by one wicket. Sri Lankan batsmen, however, gave a better account of themselves in their stunning run chase against England to romp home against the hosts. Led by Kumar Sangakkara's unbeaten 134, they chased down the 294-run victory target with relative ease to keep their semifinal hopes alive.Team News: While Kusal Perera has failed in his previous two outings, he might be given one more chance. Sri Lanka are unlikely to tinker with their top-order. However, considering Australia's weakness against spin, they might think of bringing in mystery spinner Sachitra Senanayake in place of Lahiru Thirimanne.Likely XI: Kusal Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Sachitra Senanayake, Shaminda Eranga, Lasith Malinga.Australia:For the team from Down Under, this match will not just be about tackling the threat posed by in-form pacer Malinga but also to regroup after the Warner incident. Australia have just one point from two games, starting their campaign with a defeat to England following which their game against New Zealand was washed out.It will be a big test for stand-in skipper Bailey to turn Australia's fortunes around. While he will be satisfied with the efforts of the middle order, after their good showing against New Zealand, the top-order's poor form will be Bailey's main worry. Quick bowlers Clint McKay, James Faulkner and Shane Watson did a decent job in restricting England to 269 when they were looking at a 300-plus score at one stage. They were also impressive against New Zealand with McKay being the stand-out performer, picking up two wickets. Australia will be hoping that the bowlers continue in the same vein while hoping for the batsmen to fire.In this CT: The struggling side will have to work on its batting frailties after proving to be no match to the English, suffering a 48-run defeat in what was dubbed as a prelude to the five-Test Ashes series in July-August. In their following match against New Zealand, the Australian batsmen were a lot better, with George Bailey and Adam Voges scoring half-centuries to help their team post a respectable total. The bowlers too did a fine job before persistent rain meant that the Aussies ended up sharing points.Team News: Australia's regular skipper Michael Clarke continues to battle back problems, which saw him miss the first two matches, and it is likely that he will give this game a miss too. With David Warner also remaining suspended till the end of the Champions Trophy, Australia are likely to go in with the same line-up that faced New Zealand.Likely XI: Shane Watson, Matthew Wade (wk), Phil Hughes, George Bailey (c), Adam Voges, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay, Xavier Doherty.Weather Update: The forecast is for partly cloudy skies with a slight chance of rain. However, considering the fickle nature of the UK weather, it remains to be seen if a full fifty over game is possible.Teams:Australia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Matthew Wade(w), Shane Watson, George Bailey, Xavier Doherty, Phillip Hughes, Clint McKay, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges, David Warner, Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Johnson, James Faulkner, Nathan Coulter-NileSri Lanka (From): Angelo Mathews(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kushal Janith Perera, Lasith Malinga, Mahela Jayawardene, Shaminda Eranga, Dinesh Chandimal, Chanaka Welegedara, Sachithra Senanayake, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana HerathLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
