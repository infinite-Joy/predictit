After being 83/4 at one stage, the South Africans have done extremely well to post such a huge total on the board. The pitch is on the slower side and it is going to be a mammoth task for Zimbabwe to chase this down.Zimbabwe's bowling consisted of two halves. First was when they bowled tight line and lengths and made good use of the variations. Second is when they dished out freebies during the death overs. They gave away 96 runs in the last five overs. With a mountainous total set, it is going to take some getting against the South African attack. Can they give the Proteas a scare? Or will it be a walk in the park for South Africa? We'll be back in a short while with the run-chase. Till then, you can hop tabs and follow the India versus Pakistan game.Since then, it was the Miller and Duminy show. The pair took their time to get going, but once they got their eye in, it was carnage at Hamilton. Duminy was happy to rotate the strike and keep the scoreboard ticking, while Miller bided his time. As soon as they got to their fifties, they shifted gears and took the bowling to the cleaners. The Zimbabwean bowlers also helped them by bowling poorly at the death. The 256-run stand set a few records, none more significant than it being the highest 5th wicket stand in ODI history.Wow! What a finish to the innings. Miller and Duminy might have just put the match beyond Zimbabwe's reach. At one stage, they were stuttering at 83/4, but Miller and Duminy ensured that they got more than a competitive total. de Kock and Amla failed to get going as they could not get a measure of the wicket. It was slow and the ball was not coming on. AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis battled for a while before both went in quick succession.4

But the expectation is that it will start off a little slow. It won't be a quick pitch by any stretch of the imagination. It is going to be nice and even for the batsmen,' reckons Pommie Mbangwade Villiers: 'It has been quite long. We are all fresh and ready to go. Really excited for the World Cup. We were also thinking about bowling first. I am happy to see the sun out and we are happy to bat. We will have to work hard for the first 10 overs. All 15 are fit and really happy with the 11. We have got a nice balanced side.'Chigumbura: "We are excited to play the first game. We have prepared well and it is now time to do the job. I am going to bowl first. It is a good ground to chase down and hopefully we can do that. It looks like a good wicket and should play well. The guys are in good form and hopefully, we can show the good form that we showed in the warm-up games."Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldWell, that seems enough regarding both teams and their build-up to the tournament. Now we wait for the team compositions and the toss, which is not far away. So stay tuned and don't go anywhere..ZimbabweElton Chigumbura will lead this talented side and he has Hamilton Masakadza and Brendan Taylor - two of the most experienced batsmen in the line-up to support him. Masakadza, who missed out the previous World Cup, is desperate to make a mark and he showed that when he scored a brilliant hundred against Sri Lanka in the practice game. Panyangara and Chatar will spearhead the attack. Utseya and Sean Williams will play a key role as well. If they play to their potential, Zimbabwe can be dangerous.Meanwhile, Zimbabwe have caught a few eye balls with their performances in the practice games. In the first game against New Zealand, they had them on the mat at 187/7 when the rain Gods intervened and beat Sri Lanka in the second by chasing down 279. Dav Whatmore, who took over as the head coach just before the World Cup, already seems to be doing wonders with the team. We will have to see whether they can cause a few upsets.South AfricaSouth Africa look a balanced side. Amla at the top is in scintillating form, while AB de Villiers has been in a purple patch for quite some time now. Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis make up the top-order, the former provides the firepower and the latter a steady head in the otherwise aggressive batting order. David Miller and JP Duminy slot into the the lower middle order. Dale Steyn will lead the attack with Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander and Imran Tahir playing the supporting role. Their only area of weakness will be the all-rounders role. Farhaan Behardien and Wayne Parnell will be fighting for the remaining one spot.The Proteas, as has been the norm, enter each World Cup as one of the favorites, but fail to go the distance every single time. Once again they are billed as the top team, whether they can go all the way remains to be seen. Their form has been brilliant leading up to the competition. They are coming on the back of a 4-1 series win against West Indies at home. Though they lost the practice game to New Zealand, it can be considered as one off day.Let's take a look at the recent form of both the teams, including their expected team compositions.The first day of the 2015 World Cup already saw plenty of action. In both the matches that were played, the teams batting first managed to score over 330. There were plenty of first-timers, who have already started to make a mark in the biggest tournament of all. If it was Corey Anderson and Kane Williamson in the first game, then Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell, Steven Finn and James Taylor shone in the second. We are into the second day and it is time for another one of the contenders - South Africa to start their campaign when they take on Zimbabwe at Hamilton.Preview:One team is considered as one of the favourites of the tournament; the other isn't good enough to deserve consideration. Be that as it may, come Sunday when South Africa play their neighbours Zimbabwe in an ICC World Cup Pool B match at Hamilton's Seddon Park, there would be no dearth of excitement among expatriates from both countries.There is a huge contrast in both teams' challenge. South Africa have gone into the past World Cups mostly as favourites but their best performances have been semi-final appearances in 1992, 1999 and 2007. Can they go all the way this time and shake off their "chokers" tag? That's the question on every South African's lips.The Proteas turned in a mixed performance in the two warm-ups leading up to this day-nighter. They beat Sri Lanka by five wickets in a rain-curtailed contest before New Zealand, one of the pre-tournament favourites, brought them down several pegs by inflicting a 134-run defeat. The latter performance indicated amply that the South Africans haven't completely cast off their habit of absolutely falling apart on a bad day.Surprisingly, Zimbabwe, going in the tournament as the number 10 team in the ODI rankings, did very well in their warm-ups. In their match against New Zealand, they had reduced the hosts to 157 for 7 before rain brought the contest to a premature end. And then in their second game, they stunned 2011 World Cup finalists Sri Lanka by chasing down 280. Clearly, Zimbabwe are capable of spoiling a couple of parties and if they somehow could get the better of their much-superior opponents on Sunday, they could even begin dreaming of their maiden knockout appearance.The importance of seasoned batsman Brendan Taylor's wicket and Zimbabwe's upset win against Australia in a triangular series last year weren't lost on South Africa captain AB de Villiers on the eve of the match. "He's [Brendan Taylor] just always been the thorn in the side for us growing up, and he's still a great player, and he's done so well in his career," De Villiers said on Saturday."Lots of credit to him, and we will witness his capabilities in tomorrow's game, and the other boys. Look, they beat Australia not long ago. They're a dangerous side."South Africa are also looking over their shoulders over the fitness of batsman Farhaan Behardien who is battling a back injury. In case the 31-year-old fails to get fit in time, fast bowler Wayne Parnell could be drafted into the XI. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, face no such concerns. The pitch at Seddon Park is expected to be full of runs and when one adds up short boundaries to the equation, things look more harrowing for the bowlers.Despite having stunned South Africa by 48 runs in the 1999 World Cup, Zimbabwe haven't won against them since 2000. That tells you how big the gulf is between the two teams.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Hamilton Masakadza, Sikandar Raza, Brendan Taylor, Sean Williams, Solomon Mire, Elton Chigumbura(c), Chamu Chibhabha, Regis Chakabva(w), Craig Ervine, Tinashe Panyangara, Prosper Utseya, Tendai Chatara, Tawanda Mupariwa, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Stuart MatsikenyeriSouth Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Wayne Parnell, Kyle Abbott, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Vernon Philander, Aaron PhangisoLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
