WEST INDIES:44.4 44.4 Bopara to Benn, out Benn Run Out!!1 run completed. End of the game. England stay alive in this WC. And who was the man who threw from the deep? It was Trott. Unbelievable scenes out there at Chennai. The West Indian side are shell shocked. Pollard and Sammy sit with expressionless faces. Strauss pumps his fist, his left one that is as the throw came in from the deep. Benn almost dragged it back on, there was no 2nd at all, Benn may be close to 7 feet tall, but even his huge frame can't make it for an impossible second. Trott picked it up from fine leg and had to send in an accurate throw. He did to Prior and he demolished the stumps. The England camp are jumping up and down. England take a bow. Benn run out (Trott/Prior) 2(12) Bopara to Benn, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!

WEST INDIES:43.6  Swann to Devendra Bishoo, no run, He can't finish it off. Devendra Bishoo gets forward and offers the full face of the bat as he defends to silly point, end of Swann Four men surround the youngster Devendra Bishoo as Swann comes in to bowl his last delivery of his spell. Can he finish it off here?

WEST INDIES:43.4  Swann to Benn, no run, Benn gets forward and pushes it to cover, straight to the fielderDevendra Bishoo, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:43.3  Swann to Roach, out Caught by Tremlett!! Is that the end of Windies? It looks like it. What a magnificent sliding catch by the Man Mountain. Roach has gotten out to a poor shot. He should have known that this was Swann's last over. Maybe the adrenaline was pumping, saw that flighted delivery outside off, and went after it, terrible shot to the 2nd ball, miscued it completely, big Tremlett slid to his right from mid off after running and took it with both hands. Strauss, Swann and the England camp are cock-a-hoop. England ain't going anywhere here in this World Cup even as Bumble says England were ready to start the tuk-tuks. Roach c Tremlett b Swann 0(2) Swann to Roach, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
WEST INDIES:43.2  Swann to Roach, no run, tossed up outside off, Roach gets forward and defendsKemar Roach, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:43.1  Swann to Sarwan, out Caught by Bell!! England are fighting on and hanging on by the thinnest of margins. And yes he can, Swann can do it. He gets the biggest of fishes. All the time, Bumble was crying out for a short leg. Strauss kept his cool and put in Bell there after Sammy prodded forward and the ball went to the short leg man. Bell takes a dolly. And mad celebrations as the England players are jumping around in joy. Superb captaincy. Sharp off break from Swann, Sarwan as Clarke did in the Adelaide test, went on the backfoot and tried to turn it to leg, it took the inside nick, then went to Bell. Easy catch. Sarwan c Bell b Swann 31(68) [4s-3] Swann to Sarwan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Graeme Swann [9.0-1-35-1] is back into the attackMake or break moment in this game. Swann comes on. Can he get the wicket of Sarwan?
WEST INDIES:42.6  Bopara to Benn, no run, full ball on off stump, Benn gets forward and drives hard, but finds mid off, straight to the fielder
WEST INDIES:42.5  Bopara to Benn, no run, Big Benn is skating on thin ice here, almost dragged it back onto his stumps, it was on middle, Benn looked to punch it with his tall frame, thankfully for him and the Windies, it hit him on the back leg

WEST INDIES:41.4  Tredwell to Benn, no run, leans well forward to block the tossed up delivery on the stumps
WEST INDIES:41.3  Tredwell to Benn, no run, Steve Davis has got it right again and England lose their last review, the on-field call stays, the replays show that it was just clipping the top of the stumps, so the original decision stays, if Steve Davis had given it out, then Benn would've been out, that's how the UDRS works. England can't believe it. Luck is with the Windies. Hats off to Simon Taufel for making the correct decision, despite taking a lot of time.Sulieman Benn, left handed bat, comes to the creaseEngland have taken a review. It was given not-out by Steve Davis. Benn is the man in question. LBW was the call. Looks out. No inside edge onto the pads. Remember Steve Davis has got everything right - not made a mistake whenever he has given a decision - that has not been changed in this WC. Simon Taufel is the third ump. He is taking a lot of time. Looking at several replays. Massive and a humongous moment in the game.
WEST INDIES:41.2  Tredwell to Russell, out Lbw!! Stunned silence at Chepauk. What a sad way to end a magnificent effort from Russell. The last over he was denied his 50 by the ump, as he failed to pick a tiny inside nick. Now he falls for 49. This is what happened: Tredwell is bowling from round the wicket and this one lands on middle, Russell shuffles across to clip that, moved across far too across and missed a straightish ball, the ball hit him right in front of the stumps. Steve Davis ever so slowly gives it out. WI don't have any reviews left. End of a fab knock. He walks off as Sarwan comes up to him and has a word. Russell lbw b Tredwell 49(46) [4s-2 6s-3] Tredwell to Russell, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!

WEST INDIES:40.4  Bopara to Russell, leg byes, 1 run, that could have been Russell's 50, but the ump reckons that it went off the thigh pad, it cut back in off the seam and hit Russell on the thigh, before that it took a tiny inside nick

WEST INDIES:39.1  Tredwell to Russell, no run, from round the wicket, tossed up on off stump, Russell gets forward and defends solidlyJames Tredwell [8.0-1-47-3] is back into the attackGreat to see: Immediately after Trott caught that he said it was out, then he signalled to Steve Davis saying that he was not sure. He felt that his left shoulder might have been in contact with the ropes. When the third ump confirmed that, he put his hand up and apologised to Steve Davis. Wonderful to see from Trott when so easily he could have sulked, cried and been grumpy.

WEST INDIES:37.2  Swann to Russell, SIX!!, A massive moment, Trott said that he caught it, Trott wears a bemused look after Steve Davis gave it a 6, Trott caught it, the momentum was taking him over the ropes, Trott's hat and the shoulder were just about touching the ropes, Sanjay and Nasser say on air that it is 2011 and you just can't take the word of the fielder, it was swung way into the air by Russell and Trott went back to catch, after a number of replays, the third ump gives it as 6, a fair call in the end and a massive moment in the game too, England's WC hopes could well change on this moment, Sammy has a big smile on his faceTrott has taken a superb catch at wide long on, but has he touched the ropes? It looks very close, it is an important moment in the match, Trott immediately said he caught it. The third ump is taking a lot of looks at it. Superb catch in the deep. But it is signalled a 6.

WEST INDIES:19.4 Bopara to Thomas, out Bowled!! Another West Indies batsman chops it back onto the stumps!

Don't stray too far. Get yourself something to munch on and watch this. With that wise words of wisdom, I, Srivathsa leave the comm duties for the day. It will be Sid V - who was unfortunately been stung by honey bees earlier on in the day and needed to go to the hospital - who will be doing comm till the next drinks break. PS: He is doing it on his own will and no one is forcing him to.

WEST INDIES:17.1  Bopara to Sammy, out Bowled!! First ball after drinks and a wicket falls. How many times have we seen that? So many is the answer. But Sammy has done his job, he has played an useful cameo and left. A harmless short and wide delivery outside off, it was there to be cut, Sammy went for it too, the under edge cannoned back into his off stump. Bopara strikes with his dibbly dobblies. Game on. Sammy b Bopara 41(29) [4s-2 6s-3] Bopara to Sammy, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!That's time for drinks. Some bizzare batting choices from the Windies and even as experienced a cricket commentator like Tony Cozier can't get the hang of it. So are Mike Atherton and Nasser. But so far so good for them. Still to come are Sarwan and Pollard. Don't go away too far for England have shown that every match of theirs is an experience not to be missed. All 5 games of theirs have been nail-biting affairs. You may regret it later if you think that this game is in the hands of the Windies.

WEST INDIES:14.2  Tredwell to Sammy, no run, Sammy goes on the backfoot and defends this off break
WEST INDIES:14.1  Tredwell to Sammy, SIX!!, Sammy will do what he wants to, no care in the world as he slogs this one way over wide long on, too full from Tredwell and Sammy got under that, before unleashing those huge hit of his, went a long long back into the stands, Prior and Bell have a chat with each other
WEST INDIES:13.6  Tremlett to Sammy, 1 run, Sammy shuffles across and then clips the length ball to deep square

WEST INDIES:12.6  Tredwell to Darren Bravo, out Caught by Strauss at 1st slip!! The Kent man has taken three. And what a good catch by Strauss. Takes it near his boot-laces. Good bowling to get his third wicket. Sharp turn, the perfect off break, pitches on off, lures Darren Bravo forward, takes the edge and Strauss does the rest. Another failure for Darren Bravo who made a duck in the last game. The fresh faces are doing the job for England. This will go to the wire for sure. Darren Bravo c Strauss b Tredwell 5(15) [4s-1] Tredwell to Darren Bravo, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

WEST INDIES:11.5  Tremlett to Darren Bravo, FOUR!!, Shot Maannnnnnnnnn! that's what they would be saying back in the Caribbean, it was back of a length outside off, Darren Bravo leant back and then hammered the pull wide of mid on, that's how Lara used to play those audacious pulls and since Darren Bravo is his cousin, no wonder he has some of the great man's genes.
WEST INDIES:11.4  Tremlett to Darren Bravo, no run, good call that by Darren Bravo to send his skip back, it was pushed to mid off, he was circling on it quickly and Sammy has to hurry back to get to his crease

WEST INDIES:10.2  Tredwell to Sammy, no run, tossed up and on off stump, Sammy defends
WEST INDIES:10.1  Tredwell to Sammy, SIX!!, a bottom handed shovel flick, that's what we can call that shot, with the spin, lovely follow-through of the bat too and the ball flies over deep mid wicket, such a sweet timer of the cricket ball is Sammy, wonderful batting and England have not taken the bowling P

WEST INDIES:9.3  Bresnan to Sammy, FOUR!!, Tony Cozier says that even Gayle could not have hit with such force and I agree. It was short and wide outside off, Sammy stood in his crease and just thumped it ferociously over cover point, the fielder had no chance
WEST INDIES:9.2  Bresnan to Sammy, 2 runs, short arm pulled over mid wicket for a couple, Sammy dragged it across the line
WEST INDIES:9.1  Bresnan to Sammy, FOUR!!, Sammy has come out with intent and he shows us his intent, length ball on off stump, Sammy comes on the frontfoot and then lifts it with no timing, the ball just about loops over the back-pedalling mid off fielder, the ball ran away once it beat himTim Bresnan [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attackDarren Bravo, left handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:8.6  Tredwell to Smith, out Stumped!! We have a game on here. Smith yorks himself, it was there for the drive, Smith got forward to drive and then jammed his bat in trying to dig it out, he stumbled out in the process and Prior did well to collect it and then whip the bails off even as Smith was trying to get his backfoot back in his crease. We have seen a dismissal like this in the WC, just can't seem to recollect who it was. Will get back once I remember it. Yes - I got it - It was MS fumbling thrice to stump a South African in the last game.  Smith st Prior b Tredwell 10(27) Tredwell to Smith, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!
WEST INDIES:8.5  Tredwell to Sammy, 3 runs, flighted delivery outside off, Sammy gets forward and drives into the gap at cover, three taken due to some slack effort in the deepSaurabh Somani adds: Hmmm, looks like the crowd were not so much fans of runs, boundaries or West Indies as they were of Chris Gayle. Hardly any buzz for that six from Sammy. Each Gayle thwack was greeted with rousing applause by the 10,000 odd spectators here.
WEST INDIES:8.4  Tredwell to Sammy, no run, another forward block, an inside edge onto the pads, the ball rolls to the leg side, a lengthy discussion follows between Tredwell, the skipper and Swann and finally a short leg is in place
WEST INDIES:8.3  Tredwell to Sammy, SIX!!, first run in 10 balls and it is a biggie, well tossed up outside off, Sammy gets forward and then whips it like VVS, but unlike VVS he does not place it along the ground, instead the whip of the wrists is strong enough to send the ball way over long on, Sammy is a clean striker and he has come out to take on the spinners, good ploy from him for he has failed whenever he has come in at his original position, during the recent test series against SL, he would not last more than 3 balls against Mendis and Co.
WEST INDIES:8.2  Tredwell to Sammy, no run, sharp turn for Tredwell, Sammy once again smothers it with the bat and pad close together
WEST INDIES:8.1  Tredwell to Sammy, no run, no short leg and Sammy has gotten away, it would've been a dolly to that ma
WEST INDIES:7.6  Swann to Smith, no run, loud shout for LBW, but that was slipping down leg, Smith pushed his front leg far too across and was struck on the pad, England don't review it and rightly so
WEST INDIES:7.5  Swann to Smith, no run, punched off the front-foot to cover, straight to the fielder
WEST INDIES:7.4  Swann to Smith, no run, firmly driven back to Swann
WEST INDIES:7.3  Swann to Smith, no run, well tossed up on the stumps, Smith defends
WEST INDIES:7.2  Swann to Smith, no run, once again catches the pad and would've slid down leg
WEST INDIES:7.1  Swann to Smith, no run, down leg and catches the pad
WEST INDIES:6.6  Tredwell to Sammy, no run, this is surprising, Sammy has come out, strikes him outside off as the ball spins sharply into himDarren Sammy, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:6.5  Tredwell to Gayle, out Lbw!! Stunned silence at the Chepauk. It's as if Sachin has just gotten out. That's why the Chennai crowd are the best cricketing crowd in the country. They appreciate good cricket and want to see someone as entertaining and as destructive as a Gayle stay on the wicket. But unfortunately for them, Gayle has to go. He pushed half heartedly at a ball that skidded on after pitching on off. It hit the pad first and would've just about clipped the top of the bails. The problem was Gayle did not get outside the line of off. The England camp are relieved. Now we have a game on here. Good wicket for Tredwell. WI lose a review. Gayle lbw b Tredwell 43(21) [4s-8 6s-1] Tredwell to Gayle, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Gayle has been given out LBW. As expected he has taken the review. The original decision will stand. Oxenford is the man who has given it out. Gayle walks back with a glum expression on his face.
WEST INDIES:6.4  Tredwell to Gayle, FOUR!!, a fully fit Gayle is dangerous, but an injured Gayle is deadly dangerous, he is hobbling, yet kneels down and slog sweeps it with tremendous force, one bounce over the ropes at deep mid wicket, hit with brute force, brilliant batting from Gayle
WEST INDIES:6.3  Tredwell to Gayle, no run, a slip and a leg slip in place as Gayle gets forward to defend
WEST INDIES:6.2  Tredwell to Smith, 1 run, Smith goes on the backfoot and nudges it wide of Prior, Gayle seems to be injured, he is hobbling to make it to the other end
WEST INDIES:6.1  Tredwell to Smith, no run, fullish on leg stump, Smith gets forward and drives it to mid on, straight to the fielderJames Tredwell, right-arm off break, comes into the attackStrauss has seen enough of the seamers. He has brought on Tredwell - an offie. A slip in place.
WEST INDIES:5.6  Swann to Gayle, no run, Oh! A defensive shot from Gayle and that too, leaning forward and blocking
WEST INDIES:5.5  Swann to Smith, 1 run, Swann is getting nice drift, but that is making the ball go into the pads of Smith who uses that and nudges it into the gap
WEST INDIES:5.4  Swann to Smith, no run, Smith comes on the frontfoot and smothers the spin of that tossed up delivery
WEST INDIES:5.3  Swann to Smith, 2 runs, clipped from middle, wide of mid wicket for a couple
WEST INDIES:5.2  Swann to Smith, no run, fired in on the stumps, Smith turns it to short mid
WEST INDIES:5.1  Swann to Smith, no run, Smith will play in an orthodox manner, gets forward and defends
WEST INDIES:4.6  Tremlett to Gayle, no run, low full toss on the stumps, Gayle pushes it to mid off, straight to the fielder, some peace after a frenetic over
WEST INDIES:4.5  Tremlett to Gayle, FOUR!!, Tremlett goes round the wicket, the result does not change, he drags it down short and Gayle pulls with such velocity and power that it almost carries all the way, one bounce over the ropes at wide long on, what batting and what hitting from Gayle, when Gayle is playing like this, there is no one who can match him in the world, absolutely no one
WEST INDIES:4.4  Tremlett to Gayle, FOUR!!, once again, the mid off was moved a little finer, that does not matter to Gayle, comes down the track, gets outside leg and smashes it flat over his head, lots of power and lots of ooomph from Gayle and he is getting ready to launch more
WEST INDIES:4.3  Tremlett to Gayle, SIX!!, That has landed on the Madras Cricket Club roof. This is magnificent stuff from the King of Cool. Comes down the track, gets under the length ball and sends it with one powerful swing of the bat way over long on, the crowd are going nuts here and it is such a sight to see Gayle batting the way he is doing
WEST INDIES:4.2  Tremlett to Gayle, FOUR!!, There it goes, short delivery and Gayle had already backed away to leg, pulled with not much timing, Luke Wright ran across a long way to deep mid from deep square, put in the dive, could not cut it off as it raced away
WEST INDIES:4.1  Tremlett to Gayle, no run, on the middle and leg stump line, nudged down to short fine, Smith sends Gayle backOur man at the venue, Saurabh Somani writes in: This crowd is either pro-West Indies or pro-boundaries. Each one has been cheered whole-heartedly. I suspect it might be the former, since Chennai is known to have a knowledgeable crowd, and many amongst the old-timers must have nostalgic memories of world-beating West Indian teams.Chris Tremlett, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackChris Tremlett the 'Man Mountain' comes on now. Gayle is in the mood to finish off things early. Maybe he has plans to have a party at the Marina or the Besant Nagar beach planned. He is in a hurry. Can Tremlett do something here. He bowled superbly during the Ashes. But these are different conditions.
WEST INDIES:3.6  Swann to Gayle, 1 run, fiercely struck with a lot of power down to long off, retains the strike with that run
WEST INDIES:3.5  Swann to Smith, 1 run, the full ball on the middle and leg, trying to trap Smith LBW as Swann often did before, this time, Smith closes the face of the bat and tucks it wide of square leg
WEST INDIES:3.4  Swann to Smith, no run, Swann drags his length back and Smith adjusts, taps it to the off side from the crease
WEST INDIES:3.4  Swann to Smith, wide, down leg and Smith can't connect with the sweep
WEST INDIES:3.3  Swann to Smith, no run, well tossed up on the stumps, Smith gets forward and defends
WEST INDIES:3.2  Swann to Smith, leg byes, FOUR!!, down leg and it catches the pad of Smith and beats fine leg, poor bowling from Swann
WEST INDIES:3.1  Swann to Smith, no run, leans forward to defend
WEST INDIES:2.6  Bresnan to Gayle, FOUR!!, poor shot, yet it goes away to the fence, 4th boundary for Gayle and WI in this over, their camp like it, already England are under the pump, Gayle comes down the track and throws his bat at it, a thickish outside edge beats third man who was really wide, Gayle asks for the towel as he is sweating
WEST INDIES:2.5  Bresnan to Gayle, FOUR!!, the cutter came, it was outside off, Gayle leant forward and then thrashed it wide of cover, once it beat him, it raced away, third boundary in the over
WEST INDIES:2.4  Bresnan to Gayle, no run, slower ball bouncer outside off, left alone
WEST INDIES:2.3  Bresnan to Gayle, FOUR!!, I told you Gayle is in the mood today, right from ball one he has been switched on, he was animated in the field and with the bat he is showing us his skills, comes down the track, does not middle it, yet he has the power to get it over the hands of Bresnan, Bresnan put up his hands to catch it, but it went over him in a flash
WEST INDIES:2.2  Bresnan to Gayle, 2 runs, on the middle and leg again, tucked to deep mid wicket for a couple
WEST INDIES:2.1  Bresnan to Gayle, FOUR!!, poor ball and rightly dealt with by Gayle, not the violent way that Gayle bats, but delicately done, leg stump length ball and nudged away past short fine, you can't bowl there with the fine leg up, though he dived to his left he could not get even a hand on it
WEST INDIES:1.6  Swann to Smith, no run, another thickish outside edge as the ball rolls down to backward point, Swann will create lots of problems for the Windies in this match
WEST INDIES:1.5  Swann to Smith, no run, Woah! Where did that come from? A real brute, corker of a delivery from Swann, dragged the length back, pitched on off and turned a mile across the bat of Smith, who was going back to defend, the bounce undid Prior too, he did not collect it cleanly
WEST INDIES:1.4  Swann to Smith, 2 runs, flicked wide of a diving mid wicket for a couple of runs
WEST INDIES:1.3  Swann to Gayle, 1 run, that's played with soft hands on the off side, since the men in the ring are back, Gayle spots that and takes the quick single, Strauss and Swann are not happy with the man, I think it was Tredwell who was coming in
WEST INDIES:1.2  Swann to Smith, 1 run, drifting into middle and leg, Smith closes the face of the bat and nudges it wide of square leg
WEST INDIES:1.1  Swann to Smith, no run, well tossed up on off stump, Smith leans forward to blockGraeme Swann, right-arm off break, comes into the attackThere it is as we expected Swann will share the new ball. He has got Devon Smith many times in test matches. Round the wicket and a slip in place for him.
WEST INDIES:0.6  Bresnan to Gayle, no run, Gayle is in the mood, but unfortunately for him he does not connect this time, comes down the track and has an almighty swing at that, he was aiming for the Marina beach, but he connected some fresh Chennai air, the ball flies over the middle stump
WEST INDIES:0.5  Bresnan to Smith, 1 run, steered uppishly, but well wide of backward point, Smith was aiming for the late cut and he got it in the gap

WEST INDIES:0.2  Bresnan to Smith, 1 run, a good sliding stop by the man at cover, dived to his left and cut it off, a single and Smith is off the mark
WEST INDIES:0.1  Bresnan to Smith, no run, some seam movement for Bresnan as he gets this to jag back in off the pitch, it cuts back into middle, Smith punches it to short coverGayle and Smith are at the crease. Smith is on strike. Bresnan will open the attackA hot and sticky evening at Chennai. If England lose tonight, as we know they will be heading home. Will they? They have put up a score of some substance. The last time they put up a score, they were able to defend against South Africa. Will Swann start off against Gayle? It promises to be a fascinating contest. Realtime Thiru is alongside me (Srivathsa) after Kiran desperately needed a break from the scoring duties. Tim Bresnan has the new nut. A lone slip in place for him. Devon Smith will take strike. We are all set to go.Bishoo: I really enjoyed it. It was my first game and I was nervous because I wanted to do well. I bowled slightly slower on this pitch and that worked.Both teams would have mixed feelings as they go in to the break. England started well with Strauss and Prior taking on the bowlers but lost their way in the middle losing wickets at regular intervals. Russel started the slide by dismissing the openers with some quick and skiddy bowling. The good work was carried on by debutant Bishoo who made maximum use of the turning track. The pace and spin combination troubled all the English batsmen except Trott who took the attack to the bowlers with some clean strokes. England slipped to 151 for 6 at one stage but West Indies relaxed a bit and that allowed the lower order, powered by Luke Wright to recover and post a decent target. Will 243 be enough? Could this be England's last game in the World Cup? Join us in a short while to find out.4
ENGLAND:48.4  Roach to Tremlett, out Caught by Thomas!! Off the glove and that's the end of the English innings.

ENGLAND:48.1  Roach to Tremlett, no run, that was a short ball, more of an off cutter, Tremlett draws the bat close to the body and watches it through to the keeper, the ball almost hit him as it came back in, he had to sway back
ENGLAND:47.6  Russell to Tremlett, 1 run, full again, Tremlett pats it towards cover and sets off for a quick single, had to hurry, but the throw didn't find the stumps

ENGLAND:44.5  Roach to Bresnan, no run, fuller one, driven back to the bowler
ENGLAND:44.4  Roach to Swann, 1 run, Oh dear! Darren Bravo has just missed a run out chance, the free hit wasn't utilised to the fullest, credit to the bowler for bowling it too full and on the off stump, Swann squeezed it to point and throught of taking the single, then saw the fielder at backward point getting to the ball, stood there, and at one point of time, both batsmen were at the same end, he should have thrown it to the bowler's end

ENGLAND:41.5  Devendra Bishoo to Wright, FOUR!!, make it two in a row, short again, Wright goes back and slaps it cross batted over the bowler's head, long on couldn't cut that, and Wright has stepped the pedal on the accelerator
ENGLAND:41.4  Devendra Bishoo to Wright, FOUR!!, half tracker and it's been nailed to perfection! Too short from Devendra Bishoo, perhaps the first bad delivery that he has bowled, pulled away over mid wicket with utter disdain, thumped away to the fence!
ENGLAND:41.3  Devendra Bishoo to Bresnan, 1 run, quicker one, Bresnan goes back and whips it to short mid wicketThe ball is turning big and Gayle walks to first slip after having a small chat with the batsman, Gayle likes to do that very often.

ENGLAND:41.1  Devendra Bishoo to Bresnan, no run, that's the one that skids on, Bresnan defends it off the backfootDevendra Bishoo [8.0-0-23-2] is back into the attack

ENGLAND:39.2 Sammy to Wright, out Tredwell Run Out!! That's inviting death with open doors! Poor piece of running between the wickets, Wright cut that to Pollard at point who dived quickly to his right, didn't get the ball right away, he fumbled slightly and had to run back to pick the ball, both batsmen were a couple of paces down the wicket and were ball watching, Wright decides to run after that slight fumble, it was too late by the time Tredwell realised that, the throw comes to the keeper, Tredwell is gone! Pollard pumps his fist in joy! Tredwell run out (Pollard/Thomas) 9(20) Sammy to Wright, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!
ENGLAND:39.1  Sammy to Wright, FOUR!!, poor bowling that, too short from Sammy, pulled away over the man at mid wicket, in the gap, a much needed boundaryDarren Sammy [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attackAnother word or two about today's most talked about player, Devon Thomas . This bloke hasn't stopped cheering his teammates from ball one. The English batsmen at least had an option to get out. May be they took it. Bowling Sammy boy, Benny boy, so on and so forth! 
ENGLAND:38.6  Pollard to Tredwell, 2 runs, sloppy! Tredwell steers it to backward point, the fielder fires in an unnecessary throw and the keeper couldn't hold on to the ball, they give away two extra runs

ENGLAND:35.1  Benn to Tredwell, no run, fuller, quicker, tapped back down the wicket
ENGLAND:34.6  Russell to Wright, no run, What happened out there? Russell lost his run up, looked like he would pull out of his run up at the last moment, but umpire was about to signal it a dead ball, Wright also was looking to withdraw, but what does Russell do? He fools everyone and bowls a short of a good length delivery angled in, Wright makes no attempt to go after that, he was confused, wonder what would have happened if that ball had hit the stumps
ENGLAND:34.5  Russell to Tredwell, 1 run, the West Indians have stuck to his length all day and it has worked, shortish, middle and leg line, Tredwell tucks it behind square off his hips for a single

They have been menacing, on a wicket that has offered some variable bounce, they have troubled the English top order with some good stump to stump bowling. Let's see what is in store for us from here on.With that, I (Karthik L), hand over the comms to Ajith, who will quickly take the remaining 4 wickets and have an early snack.
ENGLAND:32.2  Russell to Bopara, out Bowled!! Another one bites the dust!

ENGLAND:31.1  Benn to Wright, no run, tossed up outside off, Wright cuts it to pointSulieman Benn [5.0-0-32-0] is back into the attackDavid Lloyd is fuming on air: England practice the switch hits and reverse sweeps. They should instead practice playing normal cricket shots against spinners. Look at Sachin, he plays the inside out shot to the leg spinner at will. He calls those fancy shots, the 'Contortionist shots' and sarcastically quips that he is looking forward to Chris Gayle doing it later in the day. 
ENGLAND:30.6  Russell to Wright, 1 run, better this time, straight and on a length, Wright pushes it to point, takes a quick single

ENGLAND:12.6  Benn to Trott, 1 run, Devon Thomas will surely need lots of Strepsils - the ones for the throat  if he keeps crying like he did there, I'm not exaggerating, he really cried out there Sammyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy and that confused the Windies captain, it was tapped to the left of him at short cover and it was always a single, no chance of a run-out too, a loud yell from Thomas and back here in the office, people got scared that something untoward had happened, nothing guys just chill - still lots to come from Thomas

ENGLAND:11.5 Russell to Strauss, out Caught by Gayle!! The King of Cool or the King from Jamaica has taken a well judged catch running back from mid wicket. And to prove his coolness quotient, he does a 'palti' as we call it in the local lingo back here. Russell gets this short ball to rear up on Strauss, it was outside off and the ball climbs onto him, since the ball is bouncing, he fails to control the pull shot, the top edge swirls in the air near mid wicket and Gayle kept his eyes and then takes it with both hands. Pollard, Sammy and Co. run up to him to congratulate him. Huge wicket that for Windies as Strauss was looking mighty dangerous.

ENGLAND:11.2  Russell to Trott, FOUR!!, Trott is not trotting along, but racing along at the rate of knots, the message to the Windies bowlers should be to not bowl anywhere on the middle and leg stump line, this time he shuffles across and whips it with terrific timing past mid on, deep mid wicket was too wide and it is the 6th boundary in 9 balls for Trott

ENGLAND:10.5  Sammy to Trott, FOUR!!, Graham Gooch - the England batting coach nods in agreement after that magnificent shot from Trott, it was not a bad delivery at all, good length outside off, Trott knows that Sammy is just a medium pace bowler, comes on the frontfoot and then times it on the rise, you can't call that a cut or a punch, driven on the up past point
ENGLAND:10.4  Sammy to Trott, 2 runs, leg stumpish, worked away off the pads towards deep mid wicket for a couple, Trott is timing them well already

ENGLAND:9.5  Russell to Trott, no run, another forward defensive as the ball rolls to the short mid wicket fielder

ENGLAND:9.3  Russell to Trott, no run, in-ducker, Trott gets forward and defends it with a full face of the bat
ENGLAND:9.2  Russell to Trott, FOUR!!, Trott gets a friendly leg stump half volley and he puts it away, flicked past the square leg man, closed the face and got it away off the meat, is off the mark in styleJonathan Trott, right handed bat, comes to the creaseTony Cozier with this gem about Trott: 'He will take as long as he wishes to get ready'. So methodical he is. Tony, Trott suffers from OCD and that's why he has all these superstitions.
ENGLAND:9.1  Russell to Prior, out Bowled!! I have already mentioned that Russell is a sharp customer and he strikes here. A huge smile from Otis Gibson - the Windies coach. He would have loved that. A sharp in-ducker, pitched on off, cut back in ever so slightly off the seam, Prior is rooted to his crease, is late in getting his bat down, the tiny inside edge takes it back onto the stumps and knocks back the off and middle stump. Russell gets the 'aeroplane' to take off and jumps in delight. Terrific wicket for the Windies. Prior b Russell 21(21) [4s-3] Russell to Prior, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

ENGLAND:8.2  Sammy to Strauss, SIX!!, you can't bowl short to this man at all, Strauss rocks back and then swivels on his front foot to send the ball way over deep mid wicket, Strauss is a tremendous player of the cut/pull/hook and if you bowl short, he will hit them all day with eyes closed, first six of the innings, ominous signs for the Windies

ENGLAND:6.5  Roach to Strauss, no run, What was that?

ENGLAND:6.4  Roach to Strauss, no run, stroked from middle stump line to mid on, straight to the fielder, can't beat him
ENGLAND:6.3  Roach to Strauss, FOUR!!, magnificent shot and Strauss is leading from the front, moves across to off stump, takes it from there and clips it beautifully past mid on, Strauss is so strong there and he improvises to great effect there, nothing wrong with the delivery, just that Strauss played a fine shot

ENGLAND:4.3  Roach to Strauss, no run, tries to drive it on the up and the ball comes onto him a touch quicker, can't time it well enough to beat the man

Strauss is on strike. Roach will open the attackChris Gayle who is back in the West Indian side has a smile on his face and gives a little pep talk to his mates as they break out of the huddle. One of the hottest days of this World Cup and inevitably it is Chennai which has that distinction. Ian Bishop even said that it was the hottest that he has ever felt when he was standing in the centre. There was a rumor that Luke Wright may open, but it's Matt Prior who has walked out with Strauss.National anthems: Darren Sammy seems to be the new MS Dhoni as he has lost all the 5 tosses in this World Cup. But the good thing as he said was that he has won 3 games out of the 4. That's what matters in the end. Time for the national anthems. 'Rally round the West Indies' is first up and as it ends Darren Sammy has a big smile on his face. 'God save the Queen' is up next and as it is done, Collingwood has a friendly high-five with the small kid standing in front of him. Both the anthems are rousing ones as correctly said by Harsha Bhogle.According to Ian Bishop it was a good decision to leave Shiv Chanderpaul out and he says that some people back home even felt that he should not have even be picked in the original World Cup squad. Nasser Hussain talking about Anderson and Collingwood - makes this pertinent point - both have played in every single game over the long winter and they are 'mentally gone'. So the England think-tank feel that it is better to bring in a few fresh faces for this crunch game.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Devon Smith, Darren Bravo, R Sarwan, Kieron Pollard, Darren Sammy(c), Devon Thomas(w), Sulieman Benn, Kemar Roach, Devendra Bishoo, Andre RussellEngland (Playing XI): Matt Prior(w), Andrew Strauss(c), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Luke Wright, Eoin Morgan, Graeme Swann, Tim Bresnan, Chris Tremlett, James TredwellEngland have won the toss and elected to batSammy: Lost 5 tosses, have got 4 good results. Gayle is back, Chanderpaul misses out. It was a tough decision to drop him. Miller is out Bishoo is in.Strauss: We are going to have a bit, the wicket may crumble up later in the day. Tremlett comes in for Shahzad, Tredwell comes in for Anderson, Luke Wright for Collingwood. Myself and Prior will continue to open. We need to win in order to qualify.The captains are out for the toss, time for us to find out what happens.Pitch report: The pitch is desert like, says Mike Atherton. There is no moisture in the wicket, it is very dry and no grass covering on it. The ball will rough up and the fast bowlers may get some reverse swing. The first ten or fifteen overs will be very important.Weather report: Max temp: 31 deg, Min temp: 28 deg. Humidity is 58% Well, if you are from this part of the world, this is the best you can ask for. The temperatures are usually much higher with a higher humidity.Records at the MA Chidambaram Stadium: Eng - Won 1 Lost 1. WI - Won 1 Lost 2.Group B scenario: If West Indies wins - South Africa, India, West Indies and Bangladesh are the four quarter finalists. If England wins - Except South Africa, none of the other teams can breathe easy.Big big match folks! A win for England will make it more difficult for Bangladesh to qualify for the quarter finals while a win for the West Indies will give us the four quarter finalists from Group B. But don't write England off, they are a strong side they can throw the group wide open if they salvage a win here today. This is Ajith, I will be with you bringing you all the action along with Pradeep, Sid V and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be right back.By Saurabh SomaniAfter many weeks of preliminary matches in the league phase, this will be the first time one of the top eight teams face the threat of elimination from the 2011 World Cup. If England fail to beat West Indies in their final league match, they will end up on only 5 points, and since each of South Africa, India, West Indies and Bangladesh have 6 or more points, there will be no way for England to qualify for the quarter-finals.England: They have had the strangest of tournaments, where each of their five matches has resulted in a close finish. Sometimes the finish might have been too close for the mental well-being of their fans. The oddity of their results does not end there - they have somehow contrived to lose to Ireland and Bangladesh, while not doing so against India and South Africa. England's main problem throughout the World Cup has been that they haven't had a game where they have done well with both bat and ball. If one department has succeeded, the other has let it down. The batsmen did well against Netherlands, India and Ireland, while the bowlers came to the party only against South Africa. Against Bangladesh, neither the batters nor the bowlers did well throughout the innings.
Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower form amongst the more stable partnerships in world cricket, but somehow their team has displayed muddled thinking that is uncharacteristic of the captain-coach duo. Injuries have not helped England's cause, but given that they got back their best ODI batsman in Eoin Morgan only due to an injury, they cannot complain too much either. What England need now is a concerted effort from their full playing eleven to keep them alive in the World Cup. A minor concern that they will hope doesn't blow up into a major one was the stomach bug that Strauss and Swann contracted. Both, however, were expected to be fit in time for the match.West Indies: In an anti-thesis of what England have done, they have won fairly comfortably against the minnows of Group B, but been rolled over by South Africa. While England may have been beaten by Ireland and Bangladesh, West Indies will be aware that it was at Chennai that England stopped the mighty South Africans, and that on a pitch that affords turn, Graeme Swann will be lethal. West Indies have the firepower in Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard, and the batting talent in Darren Bravo, to overcome England's bowlers. This has been a relatively quiet tournament for Gayle, while Pollard has been explosive and Bravo has looked sublime in patches.
Their bowling was a weak link coming into the tournament, but with Kemar Roach and Suleiman Benn coming into their own, that doesn't look as weak anymore. The West Indies have not touched the heights of the 70s and early 80s in terms of world domination, and though they aren't anywhere close to doing so now - under captain Darren Sammy the team seems to have acquired an extra layer of toughness coupled with a fierce desire to do well. They have several game-changers in their ranks, who every opposition in the world has to be wary of, and they will know that a win here will seal their quarter-finals berth. A loss here could mean a potentially tricky final match with India, and West Indies will want to avoid the nerves that such a match would entail.Head to Head: There isn't much to separate the teams in overall records, with West Indies having won 41 and England 37 of the 87 matches that they have played in (9 no results). Rather surprisingly, in World Cups, England have won 4 out of 5 matches that they have played against West Indies. England though, would have gladly exchanged those four victories for that one match - because the match they lost to West Indies was the final of the 1979 World Cup.Quotes:"The plus we have is we have a coach who just a year ago was working with England, so he has inside details and will be quite helpful." - Darren Sammy on West Indies coach Otis Gibson, who spent more than 2 years as England's bowling coach before taking up his current role.
"We have done well in big matches over the last couple of years. The equation is very simple and this isn't a time to go into our shells." - Andrew Strauss keeps it simple ahead of the match.
