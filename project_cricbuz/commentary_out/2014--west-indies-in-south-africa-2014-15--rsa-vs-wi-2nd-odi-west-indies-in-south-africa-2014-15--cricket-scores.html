They shouldn't feel demotivated because remember, this is the same ground where South Africa chased down 434 made by the Australians. Can Gayle and Co. make a fight of this challenge? Or will it be too much for them? Join us in a short while to find out.West Indies sprayed it all around and with de Villiers going hammer and tongs at them, they had no way of getting back during the latter stages of the South African innings. Eventually, South Africa finished with a whopping 439/2, their highest total in ODIs. They fell short of the world record total made by Sri Lanka against the Netherlands, by just 4 runs.West Indies were poor in the field. They gave away way too many easy runs at the beginning of the game. Their bowling was poor and their fielding, to say the least, abysmal. It was only because of that opening partnership that AB de Villiers had the platform to go big, right from the start of his innings.Amla played a controlled knock, but managed to outscore the number of balls for his highest score in ODIs. He ended up carrying his bat through the innings, scoring 153 off 142 balls.Amla and Rossouw put up a 247-run partnership for the opening wicket, a record for the highest opening partnership in ODIs in South Africa. Rossouw completed his maiden ton before he perished while trying to accelerate. AB de Villiers walked in after that and the rest will now be history.The West Indian bowlers struggled to get their line right and the South Africans took full toll of it. AB de Villiers knock was special to say the least, but one can not leave out the contributions from Amla and Rossouw.AB de Villiers walked in after Rossow got out during the 39th over. In those 11.3 overs that were left in the game, he smashed 149. He broke Corey Anderson's record for the fastest century in ODIs. Anderson took 36 balls to complete his ton and de Villiers took 31.What an innings! What a knock! The ball was flying all over the park. AB de Villiers was sensational. It was one of the best knocks in the history of the game. The top three South African batsmen finish with a century each. ABD's innings was as good as it can get in cricket. 149 runs off 44 balls, he smashed 16 sixes in his innings, equalling Rohit Sharma, who hit 16 sixes as well during his 209 against Australia.4

Everyone on the ground is on their feet to applaud him. Chris Gayle bows to AB and shakes hands with him while he walks off.

Today, the South African team will be playing in pink, in support of breast cancer awareness. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.After Gayle got out, West Indies couldn't keep up with the scoring rate and kept losing wickets at regular intervals. There was another rain delay and the game was cut short by another over, but it didn't matter as West Indies folded for 164. Tahir was the pick of the bowlers and he was well supported by Steyn and Philander.During the penultimate over of the South African innings, the heavens opened up and the innings had to be cut short. After a lengthy delay, West Indies came out to bat and were given a target of 229 in 33 overs at first. Chris Gayle was back to his belligerent batting, hitting the South African bowlers to all parts of the park, before departing for 41.In the first ODI, South Africa completely outplayed the West Indies, emerging winners by 61 runs (D/L method). Even though they started off poorly with the bat, Amla, de Villiers and Miller, all made 50-plus scores and helped their team go past 250 on a track that was offering good bounce and carry.Teams:West Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Leon Johnson, Marlon Samuels, Jonathan Carter, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Sulieman Benn, Jerome Taylor, Narsingh Deonarine, Lendl Simmons, Sheldon Cottrell, Carlos BrathwaiteSouth Africa (From): Rilee Rossouw, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c/w), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Phangiso, Kyle Abbott, Morne van WykLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
