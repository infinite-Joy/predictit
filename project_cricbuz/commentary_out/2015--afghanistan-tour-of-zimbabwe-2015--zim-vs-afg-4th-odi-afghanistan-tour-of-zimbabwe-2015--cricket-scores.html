Ali Zadran is on strike. Panyangara will open the attackHello again! Welcome back for Afghanistan's chase. Panyangara will start the proceedings for the hosts, he has two slips in place. All set for the action. Off we go then...Afghanistan bowlers were on the top of their game today. They rarely erred in lines and denied any run-scoring opportunity (especially for the top-order batsmen). They would feel 185 is chasable but a lot would depend on how they go about their game in the first 20 overs. If they don't lose more than three, they have every chance of squaring the series. Mind you! Modest totals are always tricky. Join us back in about 30 minutes for the chase...Another low scoring affair and thanks to Sikandar Raza who helped Zimbabwe post a respectable target on the board. At one stage, the hosts were 82/6 and it seemed as if they were going to be bowled out for a scanty total. Raza held his nerve and stitched a much-needed partnership with Luke Jongwe for the 7th wicket. He played sensibly and ensured the scorecard kept ticking.4
