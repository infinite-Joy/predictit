The Indians troop out and are followed by the two openers..Rahane then completed his 10th ODI fifty, while Vijay registered his first. Chamu Chibhabha found Rahane's leading egde in his second over to end the 112-run opening stand. Vijay continued to play his shots but holed out in the deep looking for some big runs. Ambati Rayudu was well set for a big innings, but Sikandar Raza had him caught at deep mid-wicket as he tried to hit a maximum. The hosts then pulled things back by picking up wickets at regular intervals, but a cameo from Stuart Binny helped India go past 270. Zimbabwe used as many as 8 bowlers and Neville Madziva was the pick of the them, as he registered his career-best figures by scalping four wickets. The pitch is good to bat on.

Rahane is on strike. Vitori will open the attackThe players are out in the middle.. Can India put up a better performance with the bat?Teams:India (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane(c), Murali Vijay, Ambati Rayudu, Manoj Tiwary, Robin Uthappa(w), Kedar Jadhav, Stuart Binny, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Dhawal KulkarniZimbabwe (Playing XI): Vusi Sibanda, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Graeme Cremer, Donald Tiripano, Brian Vitori, Neville MadzivaRahane: 'We are playing the same eleven. The boys are looking forward to the match. There will be some movement initially, if we can take our time, the wicket will get better later on. I am not sure what's a good score on this wicket, but we need to bat well.'Chigumbura: 'We will bowl first. We must ensure that we do the same thing, improve by that one percent in batting. If we can get India down to the same position (as in the previous match), we will be happy. Panyangara misses out, Neville Madziva replaces him.Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: 'It is slightly colder today, there's a bit of wind as well. There are a few more cracks today, that means, it will be a better batting surface. The team winning the toss will still opt to bowl,' reckons Ed Rainsford.But for Ambati Rayudu and Stuart Binny, the scorecard could have looked a lot worse and in the end they managed to sneak ahead by 4 runs. With the ball too, India will have to somehow address the issue of keeping a tight lid on the scoring under pressure. So what sort a pitch is going to be on display today? Will there be any changes in the line-ups? All that and more coming up in a short while...With that heart-breaking loss, the hosts have been pushed to a corner now. This is a must-win game to keep the series alive. They did well in patches the other day, be it with bat or ball, but today is when they will have to gel well as a unit and play to their potential. On the other hand, Ajinkya Rahane's stars were smiling on him at the fag end of the game as he managed to get off to a winning start in his captaincy career, thanks to a sensational come-from-behind win. India will have to be careful with their batting today, especially at the top, as Zimbabwe's bowlers troubled them at the beginning.The series got off to a thrilling start a couple of days ago, with India snatching the match from Zimbabwe's bag at the very last moment. What do we have in store for us today? Hello and welcome to the second ODI between Zimbabwe and India. One has to feel for Elton Chigumbura! He's now hit two ODI hundreds and both have come in a losing cause and that too when his side was under immense pressure. It was good to see him still sport a smile though during the post-match presentation on Friday.Preview:Pushed to the brink before managing a narrow win in the opening ODI, India will have to quickly sort out their middle-order batting woes when they take on a spirited Zimbabwe in the second one-dayer on Sunday. The visitors, who huffed and puffed to a narrow four-run win to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, will be hoping for a clinical show in the second game as they look to take an unassailable 2-0 lead. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe will be eager to come up with another fighting performance and hope that it helps them stay alive in the series.The Indians have much to worry about on the batting front given that the middle order let the side down badly. In fact, had it not been for career-best efforts by Ambati Rayudu and Stuart Binny, even putting up a decent total on the board would have been quite tough for the tourists. The likes of Murali Vijay, Manoj Tiwary and skipper Ajinkya Rahane himself will have to come up with improved performances to ensure that India do not find themselves in a tough position again.Zimbabwe, to their credit, showed stomach for a fight and skipper Elton Chigumbura epitomised that with a gallant unbeaten 104. The home team's sprightly attitude will serve them well, but as the captain mentioned after the first game, the front-line batsmen need to show more responsibility and ensure that the team does not rely on the lower order in crunch situations.Match Date: 12th July 2015Time: 9:00 local (12:30 IST)Venue: Harare Sports ClubWeather: Sunny and pleasant. High of 24 degree CelsiusTeam News:Zimbabwe:Tinashe Panyangara, who suffered a side strain in the first ODI, is likely to miss this game. Prosper Utseya might take his place while Malcolm Waller, Neville Madziva and Regis Chakabva are likely to continue warming the bench.Probable XI: Vusi Sibanda, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura (capt), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Richmond Mutumbami, Graeme Cremer, Donald Tiripano, Brian Vitori, Prosper UtseyaIndia:Dhawal Kulkarni had an expensive outing in the opening ODI, which might tempt India to include Mohit Sharma, while youngster Sandeep Sharma is also an option available. It remains to be seen if Manish Pandey makes his debut on Sunday, and in case he gets an opportunity, Manoj Tiwary or Kedar Jadhav might make way. Having said that, the Indian team management is known to give an extended rope to the players and Ajinkya Rahane may well announce an unchanged XI at the toss.Probable XI: Ajinkya Rahane (capt), Murali Vijay, Ambati Rayudu, Manoj Tiwary/Manish Pandey, Robin Uthappa, Kedar Jadhav, Stuart Binny, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Dhawal Kulkarni/Mohit SharmaNumbers:3: The number of wickets Elton Chigumbura needs to reach the milestone of 100 ODI wickets. In case he reaches the landmark, he will become only the second Zimbabwe player after Grant Flower with 3000 or more runs and 100 or more wickets.7: The number of ODIs India have won in succession against Zimbabwe. India's last loss against Zimbabwe came in June 2010when a Chigumbura-led side won by seven wickets in the fourth match of a tri-series also involving Sri Lanka.Quotes:"It is disappointing to lose a game after working so hard. We learnt that it is not over until it's over, hopefully, we can turn up good for the next game. We lost wickets in groups and that's what cost us."- Elton Chigumbura, after his 104* went in vain in the first ODI"I would rate this as one of my better innings, especially scoring it after the team being five down. The ball was doing a lot at the start. It felt like we were batting in England rather than in Zimbabwe."- Ambati Rayudu, after his career-best 124*Teams:India (From): Ajinkya Rahane(c), Murali Vijay, Ambati Rayudu, Manoj Tiwary, Robin Uthappa(w), Kedar Jadhav, Stuart Binny, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Dhawal Kulkarni, Mohit Sharma, Sandeep Sharma, Manish PandeyZimbabwe (From): Vusi Sibanda, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Graeme Cremer, Donald Tiripano, Brian Vitori, Regis Chakabva, Tinashe Panyangara, Neville Madziva, Prosper Utseya, Malcolm WallerLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
