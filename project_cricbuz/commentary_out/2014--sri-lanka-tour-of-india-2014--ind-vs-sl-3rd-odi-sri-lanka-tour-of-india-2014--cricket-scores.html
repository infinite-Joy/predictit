INDIA:0.1 N Kulasekara to Rahane, no run, not much of swing on this fullish delivery outside off stump, Rahane leans forward and defends well. It was the attempted inswinger from Kula, but it didn't swing back enough to trouble the batsmanRahane and Dhawan are at the crease. Rahane is on strike. N Kulasekara will open the attackWelcome back to the second innings. The players are making their way out to the middle. The new ball will be key for Sri Lanka, if they are to stay alive in the series. Kula has the brand new white cricket ball in his hands and it's going to be Rahane, who'll take strike. Just one slip in place though.Umesh Yadav was brilliant with the new ball and with 9-0-53-4, he registered his career-best figures in ODIs. So did Akshar Patel, who picked up 3 wickets at a personal cost of 40 runs in his quota. The rest of the bowlers bowled well in tandem, although the seamers sprayed the ball around in the death overs. Can Angelo Mathews inspire his side in the innings break and get the best out of them in the next few hours? We'll find out in a while...Virat Kohli will be pleased with the show. After winning the toss, Sri Lanka could have scored much more on a good batting strip, but 242 is not good enough I am afraid. Barring Mahela Jayawardene, none of the top-order batsmen were willing to fight it out. Although Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a fifty, he looked rusty for most of his innings. It was courtesy a fine hand from Prasanna that Jayawardene was able to stitch together a vital partnership to give Sri Lanka a reasonable score.4

SRI LANKA:36.3 U Yadav to S Prasanna, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, defended into the off-sideSeekkuge Prasanna, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:36.2 U Yadav to T Perera, out Caught by (sub)Binny!! Another one bites the dust, someone would say! Perera, what were you trying to do there? Short of a length delivery down the leg-side from Umesh, Perera tried to play across the line, but he was in an awkward position to meet the ball. His feet were pointing towards cover, when it should have been much more open, hence he got a leading edge that ballooned to cover. T Perera c (sub)Binny b U Yadav 1(4)U Yadav to T Perera, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:36.1 U Yadav to M Jayawardene, 1 run, short of length delivery on the leg stump, Jayawardene flicks it to square legUmesh Yadav [5.0-0-24-2] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:35.6 Ashwin to M Jayawardene, 1 run, on the leg stump, Jayawardene turns it to short fine leg and sets off, the fielder fired a flat throw to the bowler, who was quick to take the bails off. Mahela's bat seemed to be in the air when Ashwin made contact with the stumps, but it was all too tight and the umpire decided to press the green lightAnother run-out check sent upstairs. Mahela dives to make his ground, but is the bat in contact with the floor? Is it in the air when Ashwin breaks the stumps? Maybe, the benefit could go to the batsman and it does.
SRI LANKA:35.5 Ashwin to M Jayawardene, no run, soft appeal for LBW, but it's turned down. Maybe, Mahela get an inside edge as he tried to glance
SRI LANKA:35.4 Ashwin to T Perera, 1 run, Kohli is not happy with the player, a clean pick up would have been very interesting as Perera tapped this softly beside the pitch and set off

SRI LANKA:35.2 Ashwin to M Jayawardene, 1 run, goes deep the crease and guides it to short third man
SRI LANKA:35.1 Ashwin to M Jayawardene, no run, flighted delivery on the stumps, blockedSo the batting powerplay turns out to be a disaster for the visitors, who lost three wickets and managed to score just 16 runs. What's more, they hit only one boundary and that too, it came off the first ball of the 5-over powerplay.
SRI LANKA:34.6 A Patel to T Perera, no run, flighted delivery on the leg stump, Perera defends it to mid-wicketThisara Perera, left handed bat, comes to the creaseIt's time for a water break. So from 144/3, Sri Lanka have slumped to 154/6 all of a sudden. Is there anyone who's willing to fight it out alongside Mahela? Please, give him support, he's fighting a lone battle.
SRI LANKA:34.5 A Patel to de Silva, out Caught by Dhawan!! Wicket number three for Akshar and he continues to impress. Flighted delivery on the leg stump, de Silva goes leg-side and tries to loft it inside-out over extra-cover, but he's completely mistimed it and Dhawan swallows it easily. de Silva c Dhawan b A Patel 2(7)A Patel to de Silva, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:34.4 A Patel to M Jayawardene, 1 run, flighted delivery on the leg stump, Jayawardene flicks it to mid-wicket and makes his ground just before Umesh flattened a stick with a direct-hit at the bowler's endUmpire Oxenford draws a rectangle again, signalling the third umpire to have a look at this run-out apppeal, but Mahela is well home.

SRI LANKA:33.2 Ashwin to de Silva, 1 run, a direct-hit at the bowler's end from Rayudu would have been curtains for de Silva. He just about manages to keep this slider out, plays it towards cover-point and sets off

SRI LANKA:32.5 A Patel to Priyanjan, out Caught by U Yadav!! 4 dot balls and Priyanjan succumbs to the pressure built by Akshar, who bags his second wicket of the day. This is all too familiar from Sri Lanka in this series. Some how, they need to arrest the slide in the middle-order. Fullish outside off stump, Priyanjan looks to slog it on the on-side, but the bowler didn't allow him to get under it. Pushed it through very flat and the batsman only managed to hit it towards mid-on, where Umesh flies to his left to take a good low catch. Priyanjan c U Yadav b A Patel 2(8)A Patel to Priyanjan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

SRI LANKA:30.6 A Patel to M Jayawardene, 1 run, flatter delivery on the leg stump, Jayawardene flicks it to short mid-wicket, a bit of yes-no, but eventually they opt to take the run, Binny fires a good throw but just fails to manage a direct-hitThird umpire has been called for a run-out check, but Mahela might have just made his ground I reckon. It's very close, but it looks like Mahela just manages to get behind the line. It was not a direct-hit, hence, Akshar had to collect and whip the bails off, which gave enough time for the batsman to make his ground.
SRI LANKA:30.5 A Patel to M Jayawardene, no run, flighted delivery on the off stump, Jayawardene blocks off the front foot

The ball gripped and turn just enough to fox the batsman. Mathews c Kohli b A Patel 10(14) [4s-1]A Patel to Mathews, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

We would have liked to bat first as well. The dew will not come in early. It won't be a big factor. They(Sri Lanka) have tested us in a few situations. We have a young team as well. They are quite smart with how they go about their business. We have been a notch above them. We have one change. Dhawal Kulkarni comes in for Ravindra Jadeja.Mathews: "We will have a bat first. The wicket looks good. It is overcast, the ball might do a little bit in the first 10 overs. We want to put runs on the board. Suraj Randiv and Dhammika are out. We have Chaturanga de Silva and Kulasekara coming in.Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to bat'Conditions are little overcast' says Ian Bishop. Hopefully, the rains stay away.Pitch report: "There was some life in the pitch at Cuttack, but not so much at Ahmedabad. This pitch looks hard. There is hardly any grass on it. The ball should come onto the bat. The ball will not deviate off the seam. Plenty of runs will be scored" reckon Michael Holding and Sunil Gavaskar.Meanwhile, Sanga has been rested for the last two ODIs while Thiri, Chandimal, Mendis and Eranga have been roped in.Let us find out. Welcome to the third ODI between India and Sri Lanka. Toss, teams and all the action to follow shortly.On the other hand, Mathews' men have plenty of questions unanswered. Sanga and Mahela have displayed flashes of brilliance, but are yet to impose themselves on India. The less said about Sri Lanka's bowling, the better. Can they pick themselves up and stay alive in the series?'It's about being ruthless and winning every game' said Kohli prior to this clashRayudu's brilliant maiden century has strengthened his case for a permanent World Cup berth. Young Axar Patel continues to impress with his tight darters. Jadeja and Ashwin though lacked rhythm in the second ODI. It will be interesting to see if Kohli sticks to the three-pronged spin attack or gives Binny a go. The hosts will look to extend their winning form and wrap up the series.After another shambolic defeat, Sri Lankan skipper, Angelo Mathews said he was 'embarrassed' that his team was not competitive enough. Along with Dhammika, Mathews rescued Sri Lanka to 274 in Motera. However, Rayudu and Dhawan made light work of the target, helping India stroll to a 2-0 lead.Preview by MS RamakrishnanBoth teams travel down South to Hyderabad, to play the third game of the 5-match ODI series. India don't have a great record at Hyderabad, having lost three of the four ODIs they have played at this ground. India's only victory came against England in 2011. It is an ideal chance for Sri Lanka, who are looking out of sorts, to bounce back in the series. However, India have been playing some exceptional cricket of late and fittingly they also regained the No. 1 spot in the ODI rankings.IndiaAlthough missing the services of regular members, MS Dhoni and Bhvuneshwar Kumar, stand-in captain Virat Kohli has managed to piece together a more-than-competitive side. India's top-order continues to impress, with the latest being Ambati Rayudu, who played a scintillating knock to register his maiden ODI hundred in the previous game after being promoted up the order to No. 3. The team management will be delighted to see Shikhar Dhawan, who was blowing hot and cold previously, getting some quality runs, while Ajinkya Rahane too has been amongst the runs. Skipper Kohli seems to be back at his usual best and is middling the ball very well. Suresh Raina's aggression has come in handy for India of late lower down the order and overall, the batting line-up looks quite settled.Before the start of the series, captain Kohli mentioned that the series gives his side an opportunity to try out of a few combinations and the Indian think-tank has been experimenting with the batting-order in the last few games. Asked if he would continue to play himself at No. 4 and Rayudu at No. 3, a smiling Kohli said that the plans cannot be revealed. Akshar Patel's success with the ball has come at the right time for the hosts, who are yet to find out their best match for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015. Umesh Yadav has made a good return, bowling well and more importantly, troubling the batsmen with his pace. It was surprising to see Kohli naming a spinner in place of injured pacer Varun Aaron as Dhoni had mentioned about his plans to unearth the third seamer, who would play regularly Down Under.Sri LankaNothing is going right for Angelo Mathews & Co.. The Sri Lankan skipper was so frustrated with the team's performance in the last two ODIs that he went on to say that it was embarrassing to see the way his side went down to India. Their problem starts right at the top. Openers Upul Tharanga and Tillakaratne Dilshan haven't been able to give good starts to the side and the team management decided to replace Tharanga with Kusal Perera, who is almost a CTRL+C, CTRL+V of Sri Lankan legend Sanath Jayasuriya, in the previous ODI. The biggest plus for the visitors though is the presence of seasoned campaigners Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene and the in-form captain Mathews, who has had a great 2014.The absence of Lasith Malinga and Rangana Herath is hurting Sri Lanka badly. Rookie Lahiru Gamage has been the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers, though having played just two games so far. He has not only managed to beat the bat on a number of occasions, but also has been able to strangle the batsmen with tight lines. Had luck been on his side, he would have had more wickets. It is high time that all-rounder Thisara Perera proves his reputation right and takes responsibility, having had a nightmare of a series so far. The inexperienced spin attack is also struggling to come to terms against India's devastating batting line-up, thereby forcing the captain to employ as many as eight bowlers in the last two matches.Stats:* Shikhar Dhawan needs 45 more runs to reach 2000 runs in ODI cricket.* Virat Kohli needs 50 runs to become the fastest overall, to score 6000 runs in the 50-over format.* Kumar Sangakkara will become the fastest Sri Lankan to score 13000 ODI runs, if he manages to score 82 runs.* Mahela Jayawardene needs 116 runs to record 12000 runs in ODIs.* A victory for India will see them seal their 8th bilateral ODI series at home against Sri Lanka.Quotes:"It's just about giving the guys the belief that they can do well. We are just focusing to keep the guys happy and it's working well for us," Indian skipper Virat Kohli."I think we're slowly getting better, but I'm disappointed and embarrassed by the fact that we were not competitive enough against the Indians," Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Dhammika Prasad, Suraj Randiv, Lahiru Gamage, Upul Tharanga, Chaturanga de Silva, Nuwan Kulasekara, Niroshan DickwellaIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, Virat Kohli(c), Suresh Raina, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravindra Jadeja, Akshar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Dhawal Kulkarni, Stuart Binny, Amit Mishra, Murali VijayLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
