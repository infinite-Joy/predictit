We have changes from the Test team. Lot of changes according to the format of the game. It's a really good thing to play against teams like Afghanistan.Mangal: It's a big occasion for us. We will go out to bat first and look to bat without any pressure.Afghanistan have won the toss and elected to batWelcome everyone. Big day for Afghanistan today. This is the first time they will be playing an ODI against a Test playing nation. They've done exceedingly well in the ICC tournaments for associate and affiliate nations and are sure to produce something exciting today against Pakistan. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates.Preview by Shashreek RoyAfter a spectacular Test series against England, Pakistan will now look to shift gears as they continue to hunt for success in the One Day International format. Before a four match ODI series against England, the hosts will look to flex their muscles and get themselves warmed up with an ODI at the Sharjah Stadium against their neighbours, Afghanistan. While Pakistan will look at it as a chance to get their combination right for the future series, Afghanistan will certainly want to prove a point to the ICC who recently expressed their desire to exclude Associate nations from World Cups after 2015.Pakistan:This Pakistan outfit seems to have become the talk of the town after a quite remarkable 12 months that saw them winning 21 out of the 26 ODIs that they played. In this period Pakistan also had a fabulous run in the 2011 World Cup as they went as far as the semi final. One would be living in a fool's paradise if they thought that Pakistan was anything but the favourites to win this one off ODI against the Afghans.Saeed Ajmal, who just recorded his highest number of wickets in a Test series, will be looking to extend his run of form with the ball into the ODIs. If that isn't a big enough threat for the opposition, Pakistan's ODI squad will be bolstered with the inclusion of Shahid Afridi. The leg spinner, who also holds a serious reputation for being able to clear any ground in the world, has been quite prolific with the ball in recent times. In the past year Afridi has picked up 41 wickets in 21 ODIs at an average of just 17.97 and this also includes four five wicket hauls.Historically, Pakistan has always been considered a side far greater in quality with the ball than with the bat. This squad too has the makings of a fine bowling unit with a good blend of seamers and tweakers. As far as the batting goes, the likes of Azhar Ali, Younis Khan and Mohammad Hafeez seem to bring a lot to the table and look to be in good touch after finishing up as the three highest run scorers in the Test series against England. All eyes will be on Shoaib Malik though, as he has been quite inconsistent with the bat in recent times but has been given a lifeline by being included for this ODI and the series against England. The former Pakistan skipper will be keen on getting amongst the runs and sealing a place in the playing eleven against England. This one off ODI will also be a good opportunity for Pakistan to try out someone like Hammad Azam who till date has played just three innings for his country.Afghanistan:Afghanistan are all set to play their first ever ODI against a Test playing nation and although they have nothing to lose they sure do have a lot to prove. This side will obviously look at the match as a huge learning experience, but at the same time it would also be a good opportunity for Afghanistan to show the world what they are worth.The last time Afghanistan played on a world platform was in the 2010 ICC Twenty20 World Cup. The side then looked nowhere close to being at par with the big guns, but a lot has changed in the past two years. Afghanistan has grown to become one of the strongest teams amongst the Associate nations and the inclusion of three Afghan players in the ICC Combined Associate and Affiliate XI that nearly came up on top against England XI is proof of that fact.Wicket-keeper Mohammad Shahzad who ended up making the most amount of runs for the ICC Combined team in the game against England XI is the man to look out for when Afghanistan takes on Pakistan. A side buoyed by talent, courtesy Mohammad Nabi and Hamid Hassan, Afghanistan can certainly put up a decent performance. Although the task of beating Pakistan may seem an impossible one, the task of competing fiercely may not. What Afghanistan will not want though, is to be completely overpowered and blown away by Pakistan, for if that happens then it just gives ICC a thumbs up on excluding Associates from World Cups after 2015.Final Word:Pakistan clearly go into this match as favourites and with form on their side they certainly are the front runners to come out on top in this clash. Afghanistan on the other hand will look to gain a lot from this experience and although they could very easily come out 2nd best in the contest, they could still go onto prove to the World that international cricket is where they belong.Teams:Pakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdur Rehman, Adnan Akmal(w), Aizaz Cheema, Asad Shafiq, Azhar Ali, Hammad Azam, Imran Farhat, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Umar Akmal, Umar Gul, Wahab Riaz, Younis KhanAfghanistan (From): Nowroz Mangal(c), Dawlat Zadran, Gulbodin Naib, Hamza Hotak, Izatullah Dawlatzai, Javed Ahmadi, Karim Sadiq, Mirwais Ashraf, Mohammad Nabi, Mohammad Shahzad(w), Noor Ali Zadran, Samiullah Shenwari, Shabir Noori, Shapoor ZadranLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
