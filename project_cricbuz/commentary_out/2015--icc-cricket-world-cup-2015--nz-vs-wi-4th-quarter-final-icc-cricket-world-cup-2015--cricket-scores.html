WEST INDIES:15.1 Boult to Gayle, 1 run, on a length and on Gayle's pads, tucked away behind square on the on-side for a singleGayle though, continued to deal in sixes. In particular, Gayle targeted the mid-wicket region to hammer Daniel Vettori for three sixes. It is surprising to note that Brendon McCullum used Vettori with Gayle at the crease. It is risky to try a slow left-arm orthodox against a left-hander, known for playing across the line and smashing sixes over mid-wicket. Gayle also played a wondrous shot on the back foot off Boult for a six over the long-on region. He reached his fifty in just 26 balls. Interestingly, he has mainly scored runs through the on-side. Marlon Samuels looked in good form as well, but Vettori showed outstanding judgment at third man to take a ripper of a catch and send him back to the pavilion. For New Zealand, Boult has again been on the money. He has swung the new ball and more importantly, pitched it up to take four wickets.Johnson Charles looked to take the aggressive route, but it was always going to be an uphill task to take on Trent Boult with the new ball. On expected lines, Boult uprooted his stumps. Lendl Simmons too came out all guns blazing, but was soon caught in the slips by Martin Guptill off Boult. The left-armer's angle did the trick for Boult. Drinks are on the field now. The run-rate is very good for West Indies, but they have lost too many wickets up front.

You can feel those shots around the ground. The crowd's lapping them up, but no sound has topped the one that emanated after Vettori's one-handed stunner.'

In fact, he got an inside edge, the ball goes towards the slip cordon, third slip dives to his right but it doesn't carry to himAfter completing the catch, Vettori just threw the ball up in the air without showing any emotions. Boult had a big smile on his face on seeing the catch being taken, while Baz was extremely happy as well. The Cake Tin faithful stood and applauded. In fact, someone from the crowd threw an orange shirt behind him, signifying the fact that he deserved a million dollars for that stunner! Also, the 12th man McClenaghan came out to congratulate Vettori.

Short and outside off stump, Samuels backs away and cuts, doesn't bother to keep it down. He was looking to clear the boundary. Vettori at third man was so cool. He watched the ball all the way, just jumped at the right moment. The timing was so important and he's taken it brilliantly. Can someone give him a million dollars to take a one-handed catch?

WEST INDIES:7.6 Boult to Gayle, no run, huge shout for LBW, not given and they don't have the review. Gayle didn't expect Boult to bowl a yorker, although it wasn't quite a yorker in the end, it surprised Gayle, who just about managed to get an inside edge onto pad
WEST INDIES:7.6 Boult to Gayle, wide, full and down the leg-side, Gayle fails to help it on its way
WEST INDIES:7.5 Boult to Gayle, SIX, it's high in the air and it's gone all the way. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Gayle stays on the back foot and plays a lofted shot, hits it very straight and clears long-on

WEST INDIES:7.1 Boult to Samuels, no run, short of length delivery on the leg stump, Samuels misses the flick and gets hit on the thigh pad
WEST INDIES:6.6 Vettori to Gayle, SIX, a hat-trick of sixes. Not sure why Baz introduced Vettori now. This was fired in flat, but Gayle slogged it hard enough for it to go over backward square leg. Wickets in hand will be the key for West Indies
WEST INDIES:6.5 Vettori to Gayle, SIX, Vettori goes over the wicket, but it doesn't matter. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Gayle smashes it over deep mid-wicket again
WEST INDIES:6.4 Vettori to Gayle, SIX, Gayle won't mind Vettori bowling! The ball will come into him and he can target mid-wicket as he has done now. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Gayle brings out the slog and hits it high over deep mid-wicket

WEST INDIES:5.6 Boult to Samuels, 1 run, punched wide of cover, they take a quick single, Baz rushes to the ball quickly and has a shy at the striker's end but misses.

WEST INDIES:5.5 Boult to Samuels, no run, short and rising, Samuels awkwardly manages to keep it out
WEST INDIES:5.4 Boult to Samuels, 2 runs, edgedddd but safe. My word! Four fielders chase the ball.

WEST INDIES:5.3 Boult to Simmons, out Caught by Guptill!! Boult has his revenge.

WEST INDIES:5.2 Boult to Simmons, SIX, that gets the West Indies supporters going. Full and outside off stump, Simmons backs away and carves it away over extra-cover
WEST INDIES:5.1 Boult to Simmons, no run, good length delivery on the stumps, Simmons misses the flick and gets hit on the pad, but the ball pitched outside leg
WEST INDIES:4.6 Southee to Gayle, FOUR, lofted in the air and again, the fielder is very wide. A man at conventional mid-on would have swallowed the ball. Full and outside off stump, Gayle lofts it through mid-on and picks up four. Looks like Gayle is in the mood. West Indies need him to come to the party
WEST INDIES:4.5 Southee to Gayle, SIX, my word! He's hit that like a rocket. Short ball from Southee, Gayle climbs onto it and pulls it very hard, there was a man at deep mid-wicket, but it cleared him

WEST INDIES:4.3 Southee to Simmons, no run, full and outside off stump, driven to mid-off, Baz fires a direct-hit at the bowler's end but Gayle was in

WEST INDIES:4.1 Southee to Simmons, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Simmons defends off the back foot

WEST INDIES:3.1 Boult to Simmons, no run, short of length delivery swinging back in, defended towards cover
WEST INDIES:2.6 Southee to Gayle, no run, McCullum shakes his head as he walks back to his mark. The keeper hardly appealed, but Southee was absolutely convinced and that forced Baz to send it upstairs. This is ugly batting from Gayle. Pokes a long way away from the body at this short of length delivery, the ball just nips away and beats the batHuge shout for caught behind. Not given. Southee reviewed straightaway. He was so confident. "Fair delivery," says Tucker. "Not conclusive on spin vision, can we go to RTS (Real Time Snicko). There's nothing there so it's not out," adds Tucker.
WEST INDIES:2.6 Southee to Gayle, wide, Southee sprays this down the leg-side, Gayle falls over while trying to tickle it fine but misses
WEST INDIES:2.5 Southee to Gayle, no run, inside edge onto pad this time. Gayle is hardly moving his feet and making an attempt to get behind the line. He tries to work it on the on-side and gets away with the edge

WEST INDIES:2.3 Southee to Gayle, no run, short and just outside off stump, Gayle dabs at it awkwardly, luckily it doesn't carry to third slip

WEST INDIES:1.2 Boult to Charles, out Bowled!! Knocked him over! A nothing shot from Charles. Fullish inswinger on the off stump, Charles stays leg-side and looks to force the drive through cover, misses the ball completely and it uproots the off stump. Not the ideal start for West Indies chasing a mammoth total. I hope West Indies give a good fight. Quite often, these high-scorers turn out to be one-sided contests. Charles b Boult 3(6)Boult to Charles, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
WEST INDIES:1.1 Boult to Charles, no run, bit of swing straightaway for Boult. This short of length delivery comes back in, Charles hardly moves his feet, fails to defend and gets hit on the thigh padTrent Boult, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack

Gayle is on strike. Southee will open the attackWelcome back. Gayle will have to play out of his skin for West Indies to have any chance. SimpleMartin Guptill is trending on twitter. Here's a collection of a few tweets@mohanstatsman: Highest WC scores....Gary Kirsten's 188* lasted 19y-8dChris Gayle's 215 lasted 25 days!Martin Guptill 237* for how long?@prempanicker: Samuels ? who dropped Guptill on 4 - has hit 203 runs in 6 games with 17 fours and 4 sixes. And watched MG hit 23 4s and 11 6s (233 runs)@rob_zooter: That was an absolute flogging...153 in the last 10 overs and one of the great ODI innings..#nzvwi @johnkeypm: Amazing double century by @Martyguptill, congratulations!@cricketaakash: No reverse sweeps, no scoops, no switch hits...Guptil's 237 has shown that there's room for some old-fashioned cricket too. Well played.Guptill: "It's a great feeling. The job is only half done now, we've got to go out there and finish it off. I thank the crowd for coming in and supporting us. Obviously there is pressure, but you try and put that behind. Luckily, it paid off today. It was good to spend a bit of time out there (against Bangladesh) and it was good to play the 50 overs here. It's a bit tough at the start, but once you get in, you can score freely."For the West Indies to have any chance of chasing down this mammoth target, they need Gayle to fire on all cylinders. In short, New Zealand will back themselves to win this game. Earlier, McCullum came out all guns blazing, but Holder took an excellent catch off Jerome Taylor to send him back to the pavilion. Runs flowed smoothly from Kane Williamson's bat before Russell snared his wicket. West Indies also would rue the fact that Marlon Samuels dropped a catch at square leg to give Guptill a reprieve in the very first over of the innings.Once he completed his century, Guptill touched noteworthy crests by playing power-packed shots. In the 38th over, he twinned brilliant wrist-work and power to clout Taylor for 16 runs. By then he had already muscled Darren Sammy for a 101-metre six. He also clobbered Jason Holder for two sixes in the 43rd over and reached his double century in style with a boundary. To put the icing on the cake, the six he smashed off Andre Russell in the final over was a 110-metre six! Ross Taylor too played his part by playing a useful hand to score 42. Unlike Guptill, Taylor didn't exactly bisect the gaps to send the fielders on a leather hunt. However, it was his partnership with Guptill that helped New Zealand to set the platform for a monstrous total. Once Taylor was dismissed, Grant Elliott played imperious strokes as well. Guptill played with placid calmness at the start of his innings as he looked to present the full face of the bat to collect boundaries straight down the ground. Jerome Taylor bowling half-volleys didn't help West Indies' cause. Despite losing Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson, Guptill continued to unfurl a series of boundaries to put more pressure on the opposition.Martin Guptill, with his splendid spread of run-scoring made the opposition camp feel the full weight of his meaty willow to crack a believe-it-or-not innings of 237 not out and take them to a massive total. Guptill with his double hundred broke a slew of records. Guptill turned out to be only the second batsman to crack a double ton in World Cups and broke the record for the highest individual score in World Cups. Interestingly, Chris Gayle's double hundred also came in this mega event. His knock is the second highest individual score in the history of ODIs. He became the first batsman from New Zealand to compile back-to-back centuries in the history of the World Cup. Guptill scored consecutive hundreds for the second time in his ODI career. He is only the second batsman from his country to amass a score of 100 plus in a knockout game. He now holds the record for the highest individual score by a cricketer from New Zealand as well.Some of the crowd wearing the orange t-shirts bow down to Martin Guptill for his brilliance, while Mrs. Guptill gets very emotional in the stands. He gets a standing ovation now. Phew! What a knock. So if you are dropped on 4, you go on to make a double-hundred I guess. Remember, Rohit Sharma was dropped on 4, when he made 264 at the Eden Gardens a few months ago.4
NEW ZEALAND:49.6 A Russell to Guptill, 2 runs, fine yorker on the leg stump, Guptill digs it out towards deep mid-wicket, Holder fumbles and they steal a second run as well.

NEW ZEALAND:49.2 A Russell to Guptill, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Guptill slogs and misses
NEW ZEALAND:49.1 A Russell to Guptill, SIX, oh my word! He's hit that onto the roof. A full toss and Guptill smacks it high and handsomely over deep mid-wicket for a 110-metre hit. After that Guptill goes to the non-striker, who pats him on the back. Guptill then realised that he is the second man to hit the ball on the roof at this ground and he signals two to the dressing room to tell them the same thing. He was making that signal to Craig McMillan, the Kiwi batting coach, who was the first man to do so. The camera then focusses on Craig McMillan, who acknowledges the signal and gives a thumbs up to Guptill
NEW ZEALAND:48.6 Jerome Taylor to Vettori, FOUR, this is unfair, Daniel Vettori! He walked right across the stumps, Taylor followed him with a yorker, Vettori tried to flick it, but the ball took the inside edge and went past the stumps to the boundary
NEW ZEALAND:48.5 Jerome Taylor to Vettori, FOUR, Vettori gets a four first ball! Full and in the slot, the slower ball in fact, but not good enough to trouble Vettori, who slogs it through mid-wicketDaniel Vettori, left handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:48.4 Jerome Taylor to Ronchi, out Caught by Benn!! Soft dismissal. West Indies hardly celebrate. A fine yorker from Taylor, it was slightly down the leg-side, Ronchi flicks and picks out backward square leg to perfection. Ronchi is livid that he hit it straight to the fielder.

NEW ZEALAND:47.1 A Russell to Guptill, FOUR, that's it! Sixth double-hundred in ODI cricket and the first New Zealander to do it. This is also the first double-hundred in a World Cup knockout game. What a moment for Guptill. The Cake Tin stands and applauds. His wife is absolutely elated in the stands. What an innings! Full and outside off stump, Guptill smashes it through mid-off for four. Guptill had his hands aloft as he runs, takes the helmet off and raises his bat to acknowledge the applause. His wife is punching the air in delight and he gets a hug from Ronchi. He was dropped on 4 alright, but he has been unstoppable since then
NEW ZEALAND:46.6 Jerome Taylor to Guptill, 1 run, short delivery on the leg stump, Guptill pulls it to deep mid-wicket
NEW ZEALAND:46.5 Jerome Taylor to Guptill, FOUR, has that gone all the way? Noooo! Just lands inside the rope. Full and on the leg stump, can't bowl there to a batsman batting on 194, Guptill clears his front leg and smashes it hard and straight back over the bowler's head
NEW ZEALAND:46.4 Jerome Taylor to Ronchi, 1 run, full toss on the off stump, Ronchi drills it to long-onLuke Ronchi, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:46.3 Jerome Taylor to Elliott, out Lbw!! Full and on the stumps, Elliott would have backed himself to smash that out of the ground, goes too much across the stumps and misses the ball as he swings hard, gets hit on the back leg. The impact was on middle and off and it looked absolutely plumb. The umpire had no hesitation in his mind and Elliott consumed the review as well. Anyway, he's played a fine cameo. Elliott lbw b Jerome Taylor 27(11) [4s-2 6s-2]Jerome Taylor to Elliott, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Elliott has been given OUT LBW, but he's reviewed it. I think it's a waste. Looked pretty OUT. "Fair delivery," says Tucker. "We'll move to spin vision please. We'll go to RTS (Reat Time Snicko) please. I am happy with that. No bat involved. Can we go to ball-tracking please? Okay, that's pretty good, impact in line and you can stay with your decision," adds Tucker.
NEW ZEALAND:46.2 Jerome Taylor to Elliott, FOUR, no Jerome Taylor, no! He tries to take pace off the ball but doesn't get the length right, offers a length ball in the end and Elliott, who made slight room and smashed it over cover. The ball bounced just inside the rope

NEW ZEALAND:45.5 A Russell to Elliott, SIX, this is unfair for the bowler! It was short and wide outside off stump, Elliott goes for the pull and he hits it over the deep mid-wicket fence. What a shot! He almost flat-batted that

NEW ZEALAND:45.2 A Russell to Guptill, FOUR, this is lazy stuff from Sulieman Benn! Surely had to put in the dive. This is Guptill's highest ODI score. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, Guptill tucks it along the ground through backward square leg, Benn runs to his left from fine leg, he wasn't too far away but doesn't employ the dive
NEW ZEALAND:45.1 A Russell to Elliott, 1 run, low full toss, Elliott hits it back at the bowler, who tries to grab it with his right hand in his followthrough and misses

NEW ZEALAND:44.6 J Holder to Guptill, wide, short and on the stumps, Guptill lets it go, but the umpire doesn't like the height on that one
NEW ZEALAND:44.5 J Holder to Guptill, SIX, wow! Guptill doesn't even bother looking up. Something that MS Dhoni did a few years ago in New Zealand after hitting the ball into the stands. Overpitched from Holder, Guptill slogs it over wide long-on and it goes a long way back into the stands
NEW ZEALAND:44.4 J Holder to Elliott, 3 runs, top edge but it goes over the keeper. Short and on the stumps, Elliott goes for the pull and gets an edge, Guptill quickly returns for the third run

NEW ZEALAND:44.1 J Holder to Guptill, SIX, this is the highest score by a New Zealand player in World Cup cricket. The change of angle doesn't work for Holder. He misses the yorker once again and bowls a full ball, it's in the slot and Guptill slogs it over mid-wicket, deep mid wicket runs to his left and jumps but the ball evades himHolder comes round the wicketAlright! Six overs to go. Can New Zealand get to 340-350? They should be able to get there I guess!

It was bowled at 122.5kph, Anderson thought it was a length ball and swung early, the ball goes off the toe-end of the bat and goes towards mid-wicket. Gayle moves to his right and jumps a touch to catch it with both hands to his right. West Indies will be happy to see the back of Anderson as he could have done a lot of damage in the last few overs.

NEW ZEALAND:40.2 Benn to Guptill, FOUR, Guptill sweeps it away. So easy. On middle, he knelt down and got it over the men on the on-side inside the ring. Punches gloves with Corey Anderson after scoring that boundary

NEW ZEALAND:35.1 Sammy to Guptill, 1 run, full on the stumps, driven to long-offGuptill then for the second time in his ODI career cracked back-to-back centuries. In his previous game he had scored a ton against Bangladesh. After a rather poor start, Guptill has found his touch in this World Cup. One striking aspect about his innings is that he has tended to play with a straight bat. The New Zealand camp would also be happy with Taylor scoring runs. With Guptill and Taylor lifting their game, the burden on Brendon McCullum's shoulders to fire at top of the order has considerably reduced.West Indies' bowlers struggled to stem the run flow as Martin Guptill and Ross Taylor took advantage of it to check in a slew of boundaries. When bowlers bowl on both sides of the wicket, it becomes difficult for the captain to set a field. Guptill being mainly a front foot player and Taylor looking to play back, it perhaps made it difficult for the bowlers to adjust their lines and lengths. In fact, on occasions, Guptill even pulled and cut on the front foot. Time for a Gatorade breakBatting powerplay time

Guptill could have been dismissed as well, but Marlon Samuels dropped a catch at square leg. West Indies may pay for that drop catch as Guptill has looked in fine touch. The deck is flat and there is a chance of dew coming into play later on this match. The pacers may look to bowl cross-seam as a variation under lights. Martin Guptill presented a full face of the bat to essay eye-catching shots down the ground. In fact, Jerome Taylor generated swing, but Guptill showed poise and balance to collect boundaries. Interestingly, Guptill is known as a lbw candidate against the new ball. Brendon McCullum too made his presence felt by thumping Jason Holder for 11 runs in fourth over. It can be difficult to bowl to McCullum as he is a very instinctive batsman. There is every chance that he may come down the wicket to a pacer or stay back in the crease. Drinks are on the field now

Can you go to ball-tracking. It is hitting in line, pitching in line and the impact is umpire's call. The decision will stay not out.'

There are two slips in place.The West Indies team form a huddle, while McCullum and Guptill wait on the sidelines. Some animated words to his boys from coach Curtly Ambrose. The players now walk onto the field.The teams line up for the anthems. "Rally Round the West Indies" is followed by New Zealand's anthem.Our man, Jamie Alter is at the ground. It's a big day for the city, which is hosting its first ever World Cup knock-out match and the crowd are ready for all the buzz - "The stadium looks a little more than half full at the moment. Fans still milling in through the turnstiles. Should be a good crowd," he says.Pitch Report: "This pitch has been used already. The drop-in pitches generally tend to play a lot better the second time around. There's not much grass on it. It's flat, it's been rolled really well. I think it will play terrifically well, a lot of runs. There might be dew later. Batting first, I think they should get 280-300 on the board," reckons Simon Doull.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Johnson Charles, Marlon Samuels, Jonathan Carter, Lendl Simmons, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Sulieman BennNew Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Trent BoultNew Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batMcCullum: "It's been a great week, things have really built up as well throughout the week and the anticipation of the New Zealand public as well. The boys are really excited about the opportunity to play in a quarter-final today. We know the challenges the West Indies present but the boys are in a good space and are looking forward to the game. We are going to have a bat first. The wicket looks really good, little bit different to the surface we played England on. Obviously a used wicket as well, so hopefully we will post a good score. I guess that's one of the reasons. Runs on the board can be quite valuable in these sort of situations. It's a great atmosphere here today, I'm sure it will build as the day goes on and if we can get a good score on the board, then we can be desperate in the field later. Adam (Milne) is alright. He'll be fine for this game. He's looking forward to it. He's a huge player for us with his ability to bowl fast as well in that third seamer role. He comes in for Mitchell McClenaghan, otherwise an unchanged team. Boys are excited. It is a great place to play when you get such a big crowd turn up and the Wellington public really enjoy following this team as well. So we can't wait to get involved. It's going to be a great day and hopefully we'll get the result at the end."Holder: "We've had an excellent week. We had a few days off when we first got here and then we had three solid days of training, so the guys are ready to go. Not too disappointed (to lose the toss). The wicket is a good wicket and hopefully it should hold up for the entire game and we can get some early wickets. Chris (Gayle) is back in, Dwayne Smith misses out. Sulieman Benn comes back in for Kemar Roach. There's also a thing about Kiwis playing left-arm spin so hopefully we can get some wickets from Benn today. It's all behind us at the moment. We are pretty much focussed on this game, we are very confident coming into this game. A lot of pressure is on New Zealand to win, obviously in their hometown. So just going to come out and be aggressive and come out with a win."Brendon McCullum: "We're not going to get too far in front of ourselves as a group. We know tomorrow will be a tough challenge, and we need to make sure we stand up and plan to execute our skills."Quotes: Curtly Ambrose, West Indies' bowling coach: "If we can get a good start, blunt the attack early, then we could be in for a good ball game."Weather update: No chance of rain. It will be partly cloudy and sunny. A high of 19C is predicted with a humidity of 59% expected. Should be a good day for playing cricket.Darren Sammy used a famous boxing analogy to describe how his side would go about their task against New Zealand. "It's a big match, but I remember some guy called Douglas beating Mike Tyson. It's a case of that on Saturday. We always believed from the time that the tournament started that the first goal was to reach the quarter-finals, and after that you're two knockout games from a World Cup final. We've won two. It's been a long time, but New Zealand has not won any. I watched the guys warm up today and it's just a different feeling. The dressing room is pumped, I can feel it. It is the business end, you could win all your games in the round matches but come the knockouts, there's no guarantee that you're going to win. The guys know what's at stake and we're going to do everything in our powers to beat Mike Tyson."More praise for McCullum's captaincy comes from former chairman of selectors and board president, Don Neely who feels McCullum is changing New Zealand cricket. "His captaincy is brilliant," he says. "I've never seen a New Zealand captain so good. Aggressive field settings, backs his strike bowlers. Courageous. It takes a man with sheer courage to set fields like what we've seen in some of the games this World Cup, and he has buckets of it. The way he dives into the fence, one day he'll go through one of them and get his head caught someplace. If you're fielding for a guy like that you're bound to be inspired. Fielding is such a big part of the game. McCullum is leading New Zealand into a new era."Let us have a look at all the noises made by both the teams going into the game. Starting with Brendon McCullum who is a big horse racing fan. He uses a racing analogy to describe the quarter-final. "In horse racing, and I'm a big horse racing fan, if we miss the start it doesn't mean we're out of the race. I think the horse has never been better, and we've got every chance in this game to be able to go out there and win even if things aren't a hundred percent. That's something we probably can't say about too many New Zealand teams in the past, that's encouraging," said McCullum.Chris Gayle has resorted to taking injections as he fights against time in a bid to be ready for the knock-out stages of the competition. His back problems forced him to miss the final league match against UAE, but indications from the West Indies camp is that he'll be available for the quarter-final clash. His replacement for the UAE encounter, Johnson Charles, performed credibly and that will mean Dwayne Smith - who has scored a measly 93 runs from 6 innings is the most likely candidate to face the axe. Up against the free stroking New Zealand batsmen, Holder might fancy playing Sulieman Benn, the left-arm orthodox spinner in place of Kemar Roach.Pre-match team news: New Zealand are likely to welcome back Adam Milne to their bowling arsenal. The pacer missed the last league match against Bangladesh with an injured shoulder and should come in for Mitchell McClenaghan.Head-to-Head record: It's even-stevens as far as World Cup meetings are concerned. The two teams have met each other 6 times and at 3-3, both teams have shared spoils. Worryingly though for West Indies, their last win over New Zealand in a World Cup game came way back in 1999. They have faced each other only once during the knock-out stages and West Indies took that 1975 clash by a comfortable 5-wicket margin. Does this influence today's match?Pitch Conditions: 'Cake Tin' has had a mixed record this season. There were two big league matches played and there were contrasting results in both of them. England featured in both games - Tim Southee's sensational 7/33 condemned them to 123 all-out, the lowest score by a Test playing nation in this edition of the World Cup. If that was their lowest ebb, more humiliation was to follow as they failed to defend a more than competitive score of 309 against Sri Lanka - losing by a whopping nine wicket margin. So what can be expected from the pitch for the quarter-final? It's anybody's guess.They now believe that the quarter-finals are a new ball game. One bad day for New Zealand or one good day for West Indies is enough to set the tongues wagging again. It is this belief that makes Holder's men very dangerous. "Well, you are right; as you guys put it, we were not supposed to be here," Sammy said, in his own cheeky manner. But he doesn't rule out an upset - saying that the pressure was completely on New Zealand. "We're not too bad in knockout games. We're just going to enjoy it," he added. If there's one team that turns into a force when they enjoy their game, it is this set of men from the bunch of Central American Islands. So beware, New Zealand.West Indies: If there's quiet confidence in New Zealand's camp, there's more positivity and belief amongst Jason Holder and his men. Unlike New Zealand, West Indies didn't have it all too easy during the group stages. Ireland were no pushovers but their stunning win in the first match left West Indies floundering. If they were hurting inside, the 150-run hammering of Pakistan must have soothed their nerves. If that was convincing, Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels' show against Zimbabwe brought back the old Caribbean flair. Things looked rosy and West Indies seemed to be back. It wasn't a revival though; they were hammered for 408 by AB de Villiers & Co. in their very next encounter, leaving Holder's men clutching at the straws. It was followed by another stinging defeat, this time at the hands of the Indians. Going into the final encounter against UAE, they needed not just a big win but also some help from Pakistan. Both came their way and they just managed to scrape into the knock-out stage.So how's the preparation for the big match? The Kiwi camp has stayed focused on the goal ahead and isn't willing to look too far ahead as yet. "This game it has a funny, funny way of biting you if you take your eye off the ball. We know what works for us," skipper, McCullum said. "We need to go out there and make sure we're nice and calm in our mindset, and make sure that we know what's on the line but still be able to execute the skills that have served us so well over a number of games now. In seven hours the game can turn on a knife edge," he added.If McCullum has led from the front, it's the bowling department that has well and truly placed New Zealand on the pedestal. The new ball duo of Trent Boult and Tim Southee has given opposing batsmen nightmares - and if you manage to get past them, the towering figure of Dan Vettori confronts them. The orthodox left-arm tweaker has been a revolution in this tournament. He's not just parsimonious with the ball, but his guile and agility has left many a batsman unstuck. The spinner himself isn't ready to soak into the applause - not with three big games still to come. It's about knowing that my role is to be a complementary piece to our attacking bowlers," he said modestly, ahead of the Wellington match.So what's been the focal point of their campaign? McCullum's leadership has come in for a lot of praise and has become the toast of the country. His captaincy is in the mould of his batting, - unbridled aggression - something that Sir Viv Richards greatly admires. "The way he walks on to the field, the way he carries himself, there is an urgency that he brings to this New Zealand team. It is something you look forward to when watching him play," the legendary West Indian batsman has been quoted as saying.New Zealand: As co-hosts, New Zealand came into the tournament with not just form but also with the backing of the populace. Their confidence hasn't been misplaced as Brendon McCullum & Co. have more than just lived up to the hype. It all started with a crushing 98-run win over Sri Lanka in the inaugural game of the tournament, followed by a 3-wicket humbling of Scotland. While the two wins were along expected lines, the massive trouncing of England and an equally gritty one-wicket victory over co-hosts, Australia, made teams stand and take notice. New Zealand weren't just another contender; they were fast becoming everyone's favorites to lift the trophy. McCullum's men had become the first team to seal a quarter-final berth. Afghanistan offered little fight and Bangladesh a bit more - but New Zealand finished their league engagements with an all-win record.Before we go any further, let's have a look at the respective teams' road to the quarter-finals.12:10 Local Time, 23:10 GMT, 04:40 IST: The quarter-final has moved across from Sydney to Melbourne and from Adelaide to the other part of the Tasman Sea. It's New Zealand's turn to host the fourth and final quarter-final, the clash between co-hosts and red-hot favourites, New Zealand and a beleaguered West Indies. The 'Cake Tin' as the Westpac stadium is famously called - plays host to its first ever World Cup knock-out clash. On form, it should be a straightforward victory for the hosts. But the result isn't always decided on the basis of just form and if there's one team that can spring a surprise, it is this West Indian team.Preview by Jamie AlterThis is what it boils down to. The day that New Zealand cricket fans have been waiting for. If you go by the newspapers and radio and television and chatter on the street, it is a day that was theirs for the taking since the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup started in Christchurch on Valentine's Day with a commanding victory over Sri Lanka, who were finalists in the last two tournaments. Five wins later, New Zealand's unbeaten run has set them up for Saturday at Westpac Stadium where they face West Indies in the fourth and final quarter-final for a spot in the World Cup's final four.West Indies, who lost to Ireland in their first game and who scraped into the knockouts when it seemed the world had written them off. West Indies, without Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard and who lost their No 3 two games into the tournament. West Indies, creaking from administrative instability and with a captain hardly a couple years into international cricket. West Indies, so often on the tipping point of falling into an abyss. West Indies, who true cricket fans will always want to do well for the good of the game.It could not be a better match-up for the final quarter-final of the World Cup. A David-versus-Goliath story. A pre-tournament favourite whose status had risen exponentially over past 12 months leading into the tournament against rank outsiders, who at times, it seems, were struggling to put together a squad.Sir Richard Hadlee simplified the formula for success or failure by saying that four years of preparation and planning boils down to seven hours of cricket on the field. "Once you're into the knockouts, it is totally different. It comes back to seven hours of cricket," he said. "This is four years of planning and preparation to get to seven hours, and if you're good enough you get another seven hours. Good enough again, you get to a final. Another seven hours and potentially you can be crowned world champions. Get it wrong in the quarter-finals - drop a catch, top order fails, the bowlers don't get it right, the fielding is not as good as it has been - and it can all be over in those seven hours."So far, New Zealand have played good cricket for the most, barring two scares. They beat Sri Lanka by 98 runs; Scotland by three wickets; England by eight wickets; Australia by one wicket; Afghanistan by six wickets; and Bangladesh by three wickets. They have been challenged twice, first by Scotland when chasing 143 and then by Australia in pursuit of 152, then they won by a single wicket. Nerves? Plenty, but as Brendon McCullum said on the eve of the big match, that was what the team had prepared for."One of the things which we've worked really hard on over the last six to 12 months is being able to make sure we still head into pressure games with the same level of preparation and confidence and understanding of what works for us so we can go out there and exhibit our skills and that's what tomorrow is going to present for us as well," he told reporters at the Basin Reserve on Friday. "There is added pressure because it's a knockout game, but it still doesn't take away from the fact that the game is a game, and that doesn't change just because there is more on the line. For us, I still think we need to go out and play that attacking brand of cricket which we've played throughout. It doesn't guarantee us success, and I've said that all the way along."New Zealand have McCullum, Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson for a formidable top order, but Ross Taylor has struggled and Grant Elliott is in need of a sizeable score. Luke Ronchi has hardly batted in the World Cup. The middle order is where West Indies should really target should New Zealand's top three fail. They have two good pace bowlers in Jason Holder and Jerome Taylor, but the lack of firepower after that is a concern. Darren Sammy has been given five overs in six matches, Andre Russell, with nine wickets is the only other bowler who looks like picking up wickets. Sulieman Benn's left-arm spin has produced two wickets in two matches and Kemar Roach, once the leader of the attack, has managed one wicket in three games. Marlon Samuels' whippish brand of spin has also not been a success on generally unresponsive surfaces.Chris Gayle and the scratchy Dwayne Smith (his best is 31 and his average 15.50) will have to cope with New Zealand's swing pair of Tim Southee and Trent Boult and then the raw pace of Adam Milne, who McCullum suggested would return to the XI, but West Indies' bigger test could come against Daniel Vettori, the most economical bowler of the tournament and who has repeatedly had opposition batsmen in knots with his left-arm spin. His 13 wickets have included the scalps of Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Eoin Morgan, Shane Watson and Steven Smith - all pedigree players. West Indies have lost 14 of their 39 wickets to spin in the tournament, with the common theme being hard-hit shots against slow-turning deliveries. Vettori poses a big threat with his changes of pace and nagging accuracy. Even if the top order gets past Southee and Boult, a threat remains.On Thursday, West Indies' bowling coach Curtley Ambrose was reminded of what Sammy said the day before about New Zealand, unbeaten in the tournament and backed as hosts, being the team under all the pressure. He smiled, nodded his head, and agreed."What happened in the preliminary round doesn't matter now," said Ambrose. "It's about who plays better on the day. One dropped catch or one good innings could change the whole game. It depends who wants it more. New Zealand are one of the favourites to beat us and win the World Cup. We are not. So that extra pressure could take a toll if New Zealand are not strong enough mentally. It's got nothing to do with cricketing skill, but the extra pressure of playing at home. They expect to beat us, but we aren't under any pressure. We're going to go out on Saturday and enjoy our cricket, play the best we can, and play to win."Gayle's participation is a huge point of speculation. He trained with the team at the Basin Reserve on Friday, but as Holder said, the call will only be taken on match morning. With the team banking on Gayle to return to the line-up, the management will have to take a call on who to drop. The likeliest candidate is Smith, whose best is 31 and average 15.50. Johnson Charles scored 55 from 40 balls against the UAE when opening in Gayle's place, so he should hold on to his spot. If Smith is retained, Charles could drop down a spot to No 3. Should that happen, Jonathan Carter may have to move out, even though he scored his maiden ODI fifty in the previous match.West Indies did not play a spinner against UAE, getting through Samuels for ten overs, but that may change too. The options are Suleiman Benn and Nikita Miller, with Roach the man to face the chop.On February 14, McCullum's team gave the home fans plenty more reason to be loved on Valentine's Day. Exactly six weeks later, West Indies will be out to break many hearts.Teams:West Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Johnson Charles, Marlon Samuels, Jonathan Carter, Lendl Simmons, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Kemar Roach, Nikita Miller, Sulieman Benn, Sheldon Cottrell, Dwayne SmithNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Tom Latham, Mitchell McClenaghan, Nathan McCullum, Kyle MillsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
