Brilliant start after a breakIndia in England, 20072nd Test, Trent Bridge - India won by 7 wicketsAfter a narrow escape at Lord's, India pulled off a masterful all-round display to down the hosts by 7 wickets and secure a 1-0 lead. Zaheer Khan, swinging the ball like a certain Wasim Akram, cut through the England batting before they were eventually bowled out for a paltry 198. India batted and batted big to drive themselves into pole position. Though Tendulkar top-scored with 91, it was a collective batting effort from India, an indication of their new found confidence. A lead of 283 was decisive.Despite England shoring up their batting in the second effort, India sealed the match with relative ease. It was a pity that Michael Vaughan's classy 124 went in vain. India's bowling spearhead- Zaheer Khan- was named the Player of the Match for his 9-wicket haul.Drinks are on the field now. For the first time in the ODI series, England have some sort of a hold over the visitors. They have nipped out three and the asking rate is now over 7. But India still have Dhoni and a fair bit of batting to come. Still a long way to go, before England think about grabbing a consolation win... Here is part 47 of our series on England-India Tests in England.

INDIA:14.4 Finn to Rayudu, 1 run, India want to end this quickly playing suicidal strokes, this time Woakes drops it. Another mindless slog after charging out, the thick outside edge looped to the onrushing Woakes from third man, got there and then dropped it. Hit the wrist and went to ground. Woakes curses himself.

INDIA:13.6 Moeen Ali to Dhawan, out Bowled!! Very poor batting! He got a six playing the same shot, earlier in the over, this one he is early into the slog and is cleaned up.

INDIA:6.6 J Anderson to Kohli, out Caught by Cook!! Anderson gets Kohli again! End of one of the most disappointing tours for such a talented batsman. What a good catch at slip that is. Kohli dangles the bat at that outside off offering and the edge was dying on the England captain, it was swerving away too, but he kept calm and cooly grabbed it, inches from the turf.

Wanted two after flicking to deep backward square, was halfway down for the 2nd, but Dhawan was happy with just one. Sent back and a diving, scurrying Kohli makes it, thanks to a very wild and poor throw from Buttler. Kohli isn't happy with Dhawan at all, after escaping, he makes his frustration known to his state-mate. Not printable language let me tell you that!
INDIA:1.6 Woakes to Dhawan, no run, well wide of off and an easy leave for Dhawan
INDIA:1.5 Woakes to Dhawan, no run, solid forward defensive, into the cover region
INDIA:1.4 Woakes to Dhawan, FOUR, in the air, but bounced in front of point and ran away under the body of the diving Morgan. Runs away to the fence. Full and on off, Dhawan drove and it skimmed off a thick outside edge, not at all convincing from the Delhi dasher
INDIA:1.3 Woakes to Dhawan, no run, pitched up outside off, left alone
INDIA:1.2 Woakes to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli still doesn't learn! In a Test that would've been straight to the fielder at gully, here in an ODI, he gets away. Played away from the body, fenced at it and a thick outside edge runs away to third man

INDIA:0.3 J Anderson to Rahane, out Caught by Eoin Morgan!! After a hundred, last game, now a duck. That's cricket for you, folks! Very loose stroke that - playing well away from the body to a full and wide delivery outside off, all Rahane did was to spoon a catch to point. Morgan throws the ball up in delight after catching it. Rahane c Eoin Morgan b J Anderson 0(3)J Anderson to Rahane, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

J Anderson will open the attackAnderson has the new ball. A couple of slips in place and here he comes in to Rahane...Welcome back for the chase. For the first time in the ODI series, we could've a match on our hands. England's 294 looks a good score, but we have known the Indians to be great chasers. Will Kohli come good finally and make a big score to round off a horrible tour personally? We'll know all the answers in a very short while.India in England, 20071st Test, Lord's - Match DrawnBatting first, Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook began on a positive note but the Indian bowlers bounced back to wipe England out for 298 from a well-placed 3-252. S Sreesanth picked up 3 wickets while Zaheer Khan, RP Singh and Anil Kumble bagged 2 each. India were looking to bat well and build on the late rally from the bowlers. However it was not to be as they fared worse, getting bundled out for 201, handing the hosts a handy 97-run lead. Barring Wasim Jaffer, none of the Indian batsmen, had answers to the swing and seam movement of James Anderson and Ryan Sidebottom.RP Singh and Zaheer Khan hit the right lines and lengths again but Kevin Pietersen's rollicking 134, studded with 14 fours and 1 six, guided England to 282. A defeat for India was looming large when they were reduced to 145-5, chasing 380 but MS Dhoni's valiant 76 and rain came to the rescue. England, who were just 1 wicket shy of victory, before bad light and rain had the final say, were left fuming.Shami, who fired in the yorkers at the death, was the pick of the Indian bowlers. Experts reckon that the pitch won't change much. Mark Nicholas on air said that it seems like a 'Kohli day'. Will it be Kohli's day? Do join us back in a short while to find out. But before we head for a break, help yourself to part 46 of our series on India-England Tests in England.Just when it seemed like Ashwin and Jaddu were in their groove, Buttler and Root brought out the axe and daggers to smash 55 runs in the Batting PP. Root perished soon after reaching three figures, but Stokes took over the baton to power England to a good total.So, England finish strong at 294/7. India made early inroads, reducing the hosts to 39-2. Cook essayed some gorgeous drives and put the innings back on track along with the busy Joe Root. The English captain went for one sweep too many and top-edged one with Dhoni taking a loopy catch.4
ENGLAND:49.6 Shami to Stokes, FOUR, full toss, fumble at mid-wicket and crashed away to the fence. To Dhawan's defence, he had suffered an unkind bounce. Stokes sat back in the crease, threw the kitchen sink at that. One hand came off the bat but it still had enough fuel to reach the boundary

Shami goes full and outside off, Root aims a fancy little lap sweep and spoons it into the hands of Ashwin at short fine leg. It was a careless shot, considering fine leg was inside the circle.

Buttler lost track of the ball and strayed out of the crease in search of a quick single. An alert Dhoni swooped in on the ball and tipped off the bails to signal Buttler's doom.

Michael Vaughan gave England the initiative with 195 in the first innings - the cornerstone of England's 515. Harbhajan scalped a five-fer but at the expense of 115 runs in close to 40 overs. Rahul Dravid then played a sterling knock. His 217 was a treatise on building an innings and concentration. The likes of Tendulkar(54), Ganguly(51), Laxman(40) provided able support as India themselves crossed the 500-mark.Persistent rain coupled with a water-logged outfield throughout the fifth morning prompted the match to be abandoned. For the record England were ahead by 121 runs with all 10 wickets in hand after Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick scored 114 runs at 4.07 runs per over.Shami returns. Third man and fine leg out in the deep.The Indians disperse from the huddle. If Buttler and Root carry on in the same vein, 300 appears to be in England's radar.Time for some hydration.

ENGLAND:18.1 Ashwin to Cook, no run, sliding down leg, Cook misses the whip, that would've gone downIndia in England, 20023rd Test, Headingley - India won by an innings and 46 runs.The series burst to life at Headingley with India bouncing back to level the series in style. The holy trinity of Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly were at the peak of their prowess, each conjuring up majestic centuries. However, Bangar's gutsy 296-minute 68, which shielded the middle order from the new ball can't be undermined. Having piled on 628, India held all the aces.In face of adversity, England crashed to 273 all-out. The spin twins - Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh- shared 6 wickets between them. Following on, Nasser Hussain played a battling innings of 110 to resist the Indian bowling but it was only a matter of time before India romped home to force the series into the decider.Drinks have been taken. After those two early wickets, Cook and Root have played some good strokes. The England captain though has been very lucky to survive an lbw appeal off Raina. Lot of hard work yet to be done, before they can get to a competitive total. Meanwhile here is part 44 of our series on England-India Tests in England.Replays in for that Cook lbw appeal: All three reds on Hawk-Eye. Cook very lucky to be still there.

ENGLAND:13.6 Shami to Cook, no run, that was four, but Jadeja flings to his left at point to save the boundary. Cook cut that hard and must be really disappointed at not getting a boundary

ENGLAND:6.6 Bhuvneshwar to Moeen Ali, out Caught by U Yadav!! What was that Moeen Ali? He has gift-wrapped his wicket away to India. That would've been a wide had he left it alone, instead he goes after it and it comes right off the toe end, Umesh settles under the ball at third man. The fielder didn't have to move an inch. Moeen Ali c U Yadav b Bhuvneshwar 9(8) [4s-2]Bhuvneshwar to Moeen Ali, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ENGLAND:5.4 U Yadav to Moeen Ali, no run, this time defends to cover and says 'no, no' to Cook
ENGLAND:5.3 U Yadav to Moeen Ali, no run, that was almost a late decision to play at that. Well wide of off and he just limply poked at it after the ball had gone past the bat

It wasn't there to be pulled, but Hales went through with it, the ball loops to mid-wicket where Rahane takes an easy catch. Umesh celebrates his wicket with a smile. Hales c Rahane b U Yadav 4(9)U Yadav to Hales, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ENGLAND:3.3 U Yadav to Hales, no run, full and sliding down leg, that should've been put away, but Hales fails to get bat on ball, no real appeal for lbw

ENGLAND:1.4 U Yadav to Cook, no run, good carry for Umesh Yadav, but the line is well outside off so Cook leaves. Dhoni collects it above his head

ENGLAND:0.6 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, FOUR, good start for England. This had a bit of width outside off and that allowed Cook to rock back, to cut it fiercely into the gap between point and cover. Second boundary of the over and Bhuvneshwar lets out a grimace after bowling a loose delivery
ENGLAND:0.5 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, no run, fuller and outside off, teasing line and that's left alone by Cook
ENGLAND:0.4 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, FOUR, superbly played off the back foot, waits for that widish delivery and then plays it wide of point. Once it passed the infield, it was always a boundary

Bhuvneshwar will open the attackThe England openers walk out. Sunny conditions now. Bhuvneshwar will start proceedings. 'Play' says the umpire. A slip and a lone gully in place for Bhuvi. Here we go.Teams:India (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed ShamiEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, James Tredwell, Steven Finn, James AndersonCook: "We were looking to bowl first as well. It will do a bit early on. We are desperately keen not to lose this game. We have another opportunity. There is always competition for places. There is always an equal measure of criticism and praises. Thanks. I did not realise that (when enquired if he was aware of being England's most capped ODI captain). More important is to play well and win. Ben Stokes and Tredwell come back in. Harry (Gurney) and Gary (Ballance) miss out. Tredy is our first-choice spinner."Dhoni: "We are looking to bowl first. It is an early morning start. It was a fantastic performance and the fielding was superb in the last game. We can try our best for a 4-0. We will have to do the basics right. We have Umesh Yadav back in place of Kulkarni. We saw Dhawal in the last game. We want to give Umesh a try. He has been with us for quite some time."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe sun peeks out as the two captains walk out for the toss. Tails is the call from MS.Bowl first pitch, agrees Sourav Ganguly as well.Pitch report: 'It is a bit cold and overcast as well. There is a bit of moisture in the pitch. Dhoni in the last match was happy to put England in. He might do the same today. There is some grass on the pitch. The ball will swing around in the first 10-15 overs. Overall, it is a good one-day track' reckon Sanjay Manjrekar and Wasim AkramNow, with the series all wrapped up, will India look to gauge their bench strength by giving chances to the likes of Samson, Karn Sharma and Umesh?Weather watch: A rather chilly morning here at Leeds. Don't bother too much about the rain god. He seems at peace.'Not that Cook is the only man who is, or should be, under pressure at Headingley. Eoin Morgan is the most obvious choice to replace him as captain, but he has gone 11 ODI innings without even a half century. Joe Root has failed to translate his prolific Test form to the white ball, Alex Hales has yet to make the desired impact at the top of the order, and Ben Stokes must want the summer to end. Yet so far only Ravi Bopara has been dropped. Moeen has surely secured his place in Sri Lanka and the World Cup, if it was ever in doubt, and will also hope to have his exploits in an eventful first summer of international cricket rewarded when England announce a revised list of contracted players next week'He says, 'All the indications so far have been that England are as determined to build their team around Cook as he is to defy the widespread calls for his removal. But there does come a time when admirable cussedness becomes a pig-headed refusal to see the wood for the trees.'Andy Wilson's special for the Guardian has the headline: England players have much to play for against India at Headingley'They just never learn and it upsets me to see them making the same mistakes time and time again. The one-day game has changed and we have failed to change with it' writes Ian Botham for the Daily Mirror.'Rarely have I been so angry at watching an England cricket team perform. What I saw at Edgbaston was a joke. A total embarrassment from a team who should have designs on winning a World Cup in six months' time. Instead, they'll be lucky if they win an egg cup between now and then playing like this.''At Edgbaston, England had 57 dot balls in the first 72 balls on a pitch that did a little but did not offer massive assistance to the bowlers. So the problem is not just hitting the ball but rotation of strike, too. It is about awareness. It means sweeping away a lot of baggage and having a clear-out of guys like Cook and Ian Bell. But England one-day cricket needs a refresh. As Moores said, you do not win anything without taking a risk. That time has come.'The former England skipper says, 'With six months to go, other teams are looking at this side and hoping that Cook remains as captain, and opens the batting at next year's World Cup, because they know if that happens England will not be a threat.'Michael Vaughan, writing for the Telegraph UK, opines that Cook must go.'India will get an opportunity to try new players in Headingley. Young Karn Sharma should get a game. He is an accurate leg-spinner and if he does well, he can be a huge addition to the side on bouncy pitches. They should also play Sanju Samson. If he is considered a second keeper to Dhoni, then overseas conditions are best to see how he handles pace rather than flat batting conditions in the sub-continent. It will give the selectors answers for some of their questions ' says Sourav Ganguly in his column for Hindustan Times.'India have found a good opener in Ajinkya Rahane. There will be a debate on who should open, Rohit Sharma or Rahane. As much as I feel both should be in the eleven, the amount of runs Rahane has scored overseas will tilt the balance in his favour. I've always looked at players who did well against pace in tough conditions and picked them consistently, and Rahane has earned this spot on merit. His technique and shot selection was superb and he showed one did not need big muscles to hit the ball out of the park. His ability to hit the quicks over the top will stand India in good stead in the 2015 World Cup. His form and effortless batting allowed Dhawan to settle down and play at his own pace. And once he got past fifty, the relief of performing well after a while got him going. This is the difference between the two sides in ODI cricket.''Dhoni smiled the smile of vindication when asked about it at the press conference. I do what I do. I honestly think about stuff. If it works, it works; if it doesn't, its okay. I just keep it. I like that position. It's not always that you will get a wicket, but it does a lot of things. I don't really want to say here what all it does, but maybe the commentators can find out what it does, he said.'He pens, 'Nothing highlights this contrast better than Dhoni's field placement, especially his penchant for a leg slip or leg gully. It came in for criticism during the Test matches. But it paid dividends at Edgbaston on Tuesday when Eoin Morgan, who was fashioning an England recovery with Joe Root, pinged a Ravindra Jadeja delivery straight to Suresh Raina at leg gully.'Daksh Panwar, writing for the Indian Express, throws the spotlight on Dhoni's contrasting, yet unique tactics.Oh boy, he did play some exquisite strokes in Brimingham en route to his maiden ODI century.'Amre's first task was sorting out the `technical issues' that had crept into his batting.I had to work on his bat swing, which was slightly faulty at that time. With India set to play abroad for the next two years, I had to prepare him accordingly, and he worked hard, Amre says. For every tour, I prepared him differently. With South Africa and New Zealand, it was about negotiating bounce. Before the England tour, the focus was on coping with swing, Amre said. The results show how successful the method has been.'He writes, 'On March 24 at the Ferozeshah Kotla in Delhi last year, the Team India dressing room was a party zone, with the players celebrating a 4-0 Test rout of Australia like there was no tomorrow. Amongst them was a 25-year old who was trying his best to put on a `fake' smile. In a happy atmosphere, he had reason to feel bad. After waiting for some years to wear a Test cap for India and piling up the runs in first class cricket for Mumbai, Ajinkya Rahane had wasted his debut -getting out for seven & one. More than the scores, it was his dismissal in the second innings, when he lost his wicket while playing a risky shot with India chasing a low but tricky total, that drew the critics' ire.'Gaurav Gupta's piece for the Times of India focusses on Rahane's turnaroundBefore the coin goes up, let us flick through what the newspapers have in store for us.Can the hosts pick themselves up, dust themselves off and nick a consolation win? India though are all loaded up to sweep the series. Greetings and welcome to the final ODI between England and India at Leeds.It has been all easy peasy for India in the ODIs. Dhoni's men have the series in their kitty, their first bilateral ODI series success in England after ages. As much as India have been dominant, the hosts have been outdated in limited overs cricket. They struggle to build partnerships, their strike rates leave a lot to be desired while their bowlers lack consistency. England in coloured clothing resemble a stone age tribe, unaware of iPads and other modern gadgets. The chorus for Captain Cook's axing has gotten louder and louder with every passing failure. To aggravate England's woes, the other senior pro in Bell has been ruled out of the final ODI because of a broken toe. Moeen Ali's brisk batting was the lone bright spark at Edgbaston.PreviewUnfortunately, the only things of interest in the final ODI between India and England will be whether India decide to give a look-in to newbies Sanju Samson and Karn Sharma, and also if England can avoid a 4-0 thrashing at home. With the series already in their pocket, a rampaging India would look to keep the foot on the pedal and press for a clean-sweep when they take on England in the fifth and final One Day International.In a remarkable turnaround following their humiliation in the preceding Test series, India have called the shots in the ODI series, with England struggling to match the visitors be it with the bat, ball or on the field.IndiaAfter the first game was washed out, world champions India have asserted their supremacy in the 50-over format by taking an unassailable 3-0 lead to seal the five-match series, which is their first in England since 2002, if the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy is neglected on account of being a multi-team tournament. In fact, that 2002 win was a tri-series win as well with Sri Lanka as third participants. You have to go back all the way to 1990 for a bilateral ODI series win by India in England, when they took the Texaco Trophy 2-0.MS Dhoni will look to end this series on a winning note then. And they should be successful in their bid because England haven't really put up a worthy challenge in any of the matches. So much so that the hosts 2015 ODI World Cup plans lie in tatters.India's batting line-up has regained much of its confidence, thanks to England's inadequacies. If there is one big positive to come out of this series for the line-up, then it is in the newfound opening pairing of Ajinkya Rahane and Shikhar Dhawan. Dhoni had hinted that going ahead it could mean that Rohit Sharma - when he returns - will possibly bat at number four. If that is true then India, in their ongoing preparations for the World Cup, need to strengthen their middle order once again. Rahane moving up means they have one less option. Ambati Rayudu has done well in the limited opportunities afforded, but the think-tank will do well to give Sanju Samson a run-in as well.This dead-rubber also gives Team India a chance to rest Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammad Shami and presenting Umesh Yadav and Karn Sharma a much-wanted go at the opposition. However, in the past, MS Dhoni and coach Duncan Fletcher - has been very reluctant in handing out rest to over-worked bodies. They tend to play the same eleven at every opportunity possible and it remains to be seen if the newly-appointed director of cricket, Ravi Shastri will have a say and bring about a change this time around, particularly keeping Australia-New Zealand in mind.Time and again, Dhoni has stressed that his bowlers - especially medium-pacers - need to get better in the death overs when the opposition has wickets in hand. Neither have the wickets been very placid, perhaps barring Edgbaston, and with some purchase in them for the spin bowlers, they have done quite well. This is in sharp contrast to how this same bowling attack suffered in New Zealand.EnglandNothing seems to be going right for England in the ODIs. To make matters worse, their captain Alastair Cook doesn't want to accept that selection or strategy is at fault for the string of defeats.Their new opener Alex Hales has been found out already against the in-swinging delivery. Their middle order is in shambles despite which is further compunded by Ian Bell being unavailable for this last game due to a toe injury. Gary Ballance has done well in Test cricket but doubts persist over his ability to perform in limited-overs cricket. Their top-order has not scored enough runs quickly to provide a cushion to their upcoming batsmen. Furthermore their middle-order has been unable to counter spin in the overs leading to the second power-play. They either lose too many wickets in the first 20 overs or before the 35th over, thus not putting any pressure on the opposition at all. They had lost 8 wickets before the last 15 overs commenced in Cardiff, 5 wickets in Nottingham and then another 5 wickets in Birmingham. In effect, this has meant easy-going for the Indian bowlers.England's bowlers too have been left handicapped with the batsmen's inability to score big. James Anderson has hardly replicated his stunning form in the Tests, while the likes of Chris Woakes and Steven Finn have hardly proved to be a bother for India's batsmen. Moeen Ali too proved to ineffective with the ball, although he did his bit with the bat, and England will hope one of their bowlers have a storming outing and end the series on a winning note.Teams:India (From): Ajinkya Rahane, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Dhawal Kulkarni, Mohammed Shami, Mohit Sharma, Sanju Samson, Umesh Yadav, Stuart Binny, Karn Sharma, Murali VijayEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Alex Hales, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Steven Finn, James Anderson, Harry Gurney, James Tredwell, Ben Stokes, Chris JordanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
