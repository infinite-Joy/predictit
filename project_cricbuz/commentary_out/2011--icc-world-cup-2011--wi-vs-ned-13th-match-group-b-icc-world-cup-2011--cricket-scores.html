He will take you through till the end of this game although he lost his mobile phone at the stadium and looks a little down, when he went to watch the game last night at Bengaluru.
NETHERLANDS:18.2  Sammy to Borren, out Caught by Pollard!! I don't know what pill Borren took, but for sure it did not work or it might have been a 'get out pill'. Please excuse the pun. Short and wide outside off, he could have hit anywhere, but he found Pollard at backward point. Easy peasy and he walks off. Sammy has his first wicket.

NETHERLANDS:10.2  Benn to Grooth, out Lbw!! Sammy is jumping up in the air and high-fiving Benn, not because he is so tall and is like a tower, but for the successful review. A good review after some drama, when Saheba did not realise they wanted to go for it and Benn was almost ready to bowl his next delivery. This is what happened: Flighted from round the wicket, it drifts in and strikes Grooth low on the front pad, he was forward, but unlike Bell who was more than 2.5 metres forward yesterday, and got away, Grooth won't today. Pad before bat and would have hit middle of middle. WI are all over the Dutch. Grooth lbw b Benn 1(5) Benn to Grooth, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Saheba keeps shouting bat first, bat first even as Sammy was asking for the review. Then after sometime Sammy signals to him, Saheba goes upstairs. The original decision was not-out as Grooth was struck on the pad. Similar to the one that Tendo go, struck low on the pad as Grooth came forward to defend. Looks out and Saheba reverses his decision.

NETHERLANDS:9.3  Roach to Zuiderent, out Bowled!! That one was pacy, clocked at 149 ks and found a way past his defences. Roach celebrates with his mates, pointing his finger at someone and seemingly suggesting that - 'I told you so'. Full and almost yorker length, Zuiderent played all over that, fell over, no footwork and in trying to work it to leg, missed, it hit the front pad and then took out the off stump. Fine delivery. Zuiderent b Roach 1(4) Roach to Zuiderent, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
NETHERLANDS:9.2  Roach to Zuiderent, no run, back of a length delivery and on off stump, Zuiderent taps it to backward point, he stood beside the line of the ball and played that

NETHERLANDS:8.1  Benn to Doeschate, out Lbw!! The Dutch's main man has been shot down and the Windies are on their way to registering their first win in the competition. Doeschate got well forward to defend and the ball drifted in the air and struck him near the ankles, just above the boot. Doeschate too knew he was out, but went for the review in hope. That hope turned out to be a false one. It would have crashed into middle and leg. It straightened enough and the Dutch lose one of their reviews. Doeschate lbw b Benn 7(6) [4s-1] Benn to Doeschate, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Is Doeschate reviewing it? Yes he is. He has been given out LBW off Benn. Looks out to the naked eye. Saheba is the man who was given it out. So we may never be sure. Straight into the pad and struck well below the knee roll and Saheba, my apologies, you have got it right for a change.

NETHERLANDS:7.5  Roach to Doeschate, 1 run, takes another single with a soft tap to the on side

NETHERLANDS:6.4  Benn to Kervezee, out Stumped!! And just as I typed that he had the talent, he plays a horrid shot and gets out. Maybe he was irritated by the constant chatter from behind the stumps by Thomas - the keeper - and decided to walk away. Anyway, he jumped down the track and Benn dragged it down a tad, beating Kervezee's ugly swipe across the line and Thomas has the easiest of tasks. A huge roar from Benn after getting the wicket. Kervezee st Thomas b Benn 14(20) [4s-2] Benn to Kervezee, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!

NETHERLANDS:3.5  Roach to Kervezee, no run, that was worked to mid wicket and the ball went to the man at the rate of knots, straight to him though

Full delivery outside off, Barresi went for the drive and the edge flew to 1st slip, Sammy went to his left hoping to catch and distracted him, but Gayle kept his nerve and hung on with one hand. The ball fell into his mid-riff and then he clung on. Both Sammy and Gayle sport huge smiles on their faces after all is well in the end. Barresi c Gayle b Roach 0(5) Roach to Barresi, THATS OUT!!

NETHERLANDS:0.5  Benn to Barresi, no run, an inside edge onto the pads saved Barresi, skidded on with the arm, Barresi was going back to defend and the bull thudded into his back pad via a fat edge, that's why the Windies did not refer

Kervezee is on strike. Benn will open the attackThe Dutch put in a gallant effort and scored big against England, albeit when batting first. Can ten Doeschate play another big one? Will we witness the 2nd tie in a row of this WC? Maybe it is expecting too much, but 'hope is the elixir of life' - the Dutch will be hoping and praying. We are all set for the restart and Benn will be starting off things. A slip and a short mid wicket in place for him.Sarwan and Bravo chipped in with useful knocks but it was left to the big-hitting Pollard to surge the Windies from a decent score to something monstrous. He did not disappoint the sparse crowd as he showed his entire range of strokes much to the dismay of the Netherlands. Seelaar was the lone bowler to escape harsh treatment amidst the carnage and much of it can be attributed to the fact that he showed tremendous control over his bowling variations. Batting is the major strength of this Dutch squad, but it will need some massive heroics if they are to chase this down. Do join us 6:40 IST for the chase.Netherlands surprised one and all when they elected to field first on winning the toss. It was a decision they would perhaps regret at the break as WI fired on all cylinders. Gayle was very slow in the beginning as he took his time to settle down. Devon Smith made sure that the run rate would not suffer as he opened up with some cracking strokes on either side of the ground. Gayle though opened up later as he signaled out Ryan ten Doeschate for some special treatment. Both went past fifty but failed to convert it into something bigger, but they had laid the foundation for a massive score. 4

Dwayne Bravo will be dearly missed. Nikita Miller comes in for him. We need to set our batting order right and put runs on board.Peter Borren: We are going to field first. Having watched the game the other day, the ball may come onto the bat better under lights. We need to get some confidence and put forth a better performance.Pitch report: The wicket looks dry, it is the same wicket that was used for the SA WI game. Spin will come into play today. There are a lot of cracks on the wicket but they won't be much of a worry for the batsmen. Win the toss and bat first says Tom Moody.Ten Doeschate: I don't think I have an added burden, the other guys are playing well and hopefully someone will get a big knock today. The wickets will be a slightly slower, we need to be on our feet. The West Indies are a very good team, we need to catch them off guard and capitalise.Darren Bravo: A big disappointment that Dwayne Bravo is not playing, it will be a big loss. But he has taken it with a cool head, I am sorry for him and I will take more responsibilities and repeat the same thing that I did against South Africa. Not too sure who will replace Dwayne, it is left to the selectors.Hello folks, a warm welcome to the game between West Indies and Netherlands from Delhi. After the game against England, it will be harsh to call them minnows and on the other hand, West Indies will look to put the loss against SA behind and turn things around before it gets too late. This is Ajith, I will take you through the day along with Srivathsa, Pradeep and Ganesh. Don't go away, we'll be right back with more updates.By Vishaal LoganathanAfter losing their opening matches against more established oppositions, both West Indies and Netherlands will look to use the opportunity to get their World Cup campaign back on track with a winning performance. Group B is the trickier of the two groups and West Indies will be vying for a spot in the last eight along with Bangladesh, Netherlands and Ireland. The match will prove vital for both teams as a defeat would leave them with an almost impossible task of going through to the quarters.Head to Head: Netherlands have played the West Indian team only once before and they were shot out for 80 before the Calypso Kings got to the score in less than 15 overs.Team News: West Indies: The West Indies were left to deal with a cruel setback even before the World Cup started with both Carlton Baugh and Adrian Barath being ruled out with injuries. They received a severe hammer-blow during their first match, with key player Dwayne Bravo injuring himself while bowling and it will be tough for anyone to fill in his shoes. Their first match against the Proteas gave them some positives, the most prominent among them being the form and maturity shown by Darren Bravo. The left hander, whose style is reminiscent of the great Brian Lara was impressive during his 82 ball vigil. Devon Smith too showed he is capable of playing the anchor role at the top with a patient 36. Their bowling, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired with the South Africans, especially AB de Villiers feasting on the bowling attack and going by the way the Netherlands team batted against England, the West Indies bowlers will have to work their socks off if they have to deliver the goods.Netherlands: The Dutch were probably the only associate nation to have impressed in their opening match, and it was largely thanks due to a fantastic all-round performance by Ryan ten Doeschate. The allrounder smashed a fabulous 119 and then returned to take 2 wickets to keep Netherlands in the game till the very end. They posted an impressive 292/6 in 50 overs against a team that's renowned for its bowling. Doeschate was not the only player to impress with the bat; Tom Cooper, Tom de Grooth and Peter Borren too chipped in with useful runs to help the team in orange post a commanding total. However, the bowlers could not back up the batters as a power packed England batting line up helping them sneak home with a little over an over left. Doeschate was again the star with 2/47 while Pieter Seelaar too impressed with his left arm spin. West Indies will provide a massive task for the Dutch team, but they can taken immense confidence from their opening match and look to continue their good performances.Captains SpeakPeter Borren: "The move by the ICC has put a bit of pressure on us to perform. We played a full member team just once in the last three to four years before this World Cup. So we need to play them more. We need to perform here because some pressure is there."
Darren Sammy: "I think we've got to have that self-belief. We know what we are capable of doing and as long as we play to our full potential we could beat any team on the day. But we just have to be consistent in our performances."Teams:West Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Devon Smith, Darren Bravo, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Kieron Pollard, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Nikita Miller, Sulieman Benn, Kemar Roach, Ravi Rampaul, Kirk Edwards, Andre RussellNetherlands (From): Alexei Kervezee, Wesley Barresi(w), Tom Cooper, Ryan ten Doeschate, Bas Zuiderent, Tom de Grooth, Peter Borren(c), Mudassar Bukhari, Pieter Seelaar, Bernard Loots, Berend Westdijk, Adeel Raja, Atse Buurman, Bradley Kruger, Eric SzwarczynskiLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
