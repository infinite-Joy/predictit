Sami will open the attackWelcome back.. Two slips in place for SamiHere are some highlights of Pakistan's innings:This is the second time where all the top four Pakistani batters have scored in excess of 50 runs. Shoaib Malik's 70-ball century is also the second fastest century at Lahore. 375/3 is also the highest team total at Lahore in ODIs.It will be a huge task for the visitors to chase this down. However, they showed some fight in the T20s. It will be interesting to see how the chase goes. Stay tuned for Zimbabwe's response in a short while.Pakistan skipper, Azhar Ali, departed after scoring 79 while Hafeez was bowled by Utseya. Malik and Sohail spent ample time in the middle to get used to the conditions. Once they were set, they smashed the Zimbabwean bowlers all over the park. Shoaib Malik reached his 8th century and played some delightful strokes during his brilliant knock. It took 6 years and 31 innings for the veteran to reach his 8th ton. Haris Sohail also played a superb knock as he gave good support to Malik. As a result, Pakistan posted a mammoth total and ensured that they are in the driver's seat to win this game.After 6 long years, ODIs have made a return to Pakistan and they couldn't have asked for a better start to proceedings. Pakistan opted to bat and they made full use of the conditions. The openers got them off to the best of starts as Hafeez and Azhar Ali put on a 170-run stand for the first wicket. Although the opening duo played cautiously for the first eight overs, they shifted gears later on as they kept punishing the hapless Zimbabwean pacers. Zimbabwe's bowlers kept bowling poor lengths and paid the price for doing so.4
