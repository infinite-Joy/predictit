NEW ZEALAND:34.6 34.6 Malinga to Bennett, out Bowled!! That's it, Malinga has cleaned up Bennett here, he gave him a bouncer the previous delivery, Bennett was perhaps hoping for something similar as he stood rooted in his crease, Mistake, it was a fuller length delivery homing on the off-stump, Bennett pokes limply at that and predictably is beaten by raw pace, the off-stump is flattened out of the ground and that is the match for the Lankans. The Lankans have registered a comprehensive 112 run victory that ensures the 2nd spot in Group A. The wily old fox, Murali, was simply outstanding and the Kiwi batsmen had absolutely no idea as to how to play him, Mendis supported him well, the Kiwis seemed to be distracted by the controversial non-dismissal of Jayawardene and that seemed to have played into their minds.

NEW ZEALAND:12.6  Mathews to Taylor, FOUR!!, slashed away, no chance for Dilshan or any one this time, short and wide outside off, cut deliberately up and over the man at point, fast hands, sweet spot of the bat and it went racing down to the fence
NEW ZEALAND:12.5  Mathews to Taylor, 2 runs, Dilshan shows us his skills, that's how you do it Tharanga, he seems to suggest, smashed hard into the ground, he leaps high in the air and gets both hands to the ball at backward point, makes a half stop

Both the teams have been jousting and scrapping every ball since that incident happened. Now 'Superman Angelo' is back on.
NEW ZEALAND:11.6  Kulasekara to Taylor, no run, nearly dragged back on, Taylor edged his attempted punch off the backfoot to his back leg, so easily could have gone back onto the stumps

NEW ZEALAND:10.6  Malinga to Taylor, no run, some peace out there as Taylor stands tall and defends the rising delivery from Malinga
NEW ZEALAND:10.5 Malinga to Taylor, SIX!!, 'You got to be kidding me' says Mark Nicholas on air and this is seriously poor stuff from the Lankans, Kula is the man at third man who palmed it over the bar, already we have seen it in this game from Baz, Tharanga and now Kula, it could well have been a football game, upper cut by Taylor, more of a thick slash from him, Kula ran in, misjudged it completely and then as the ball came to him much faster, he could not hold it at all, now Taylor is let-off
NEW ZEALAND:10.4  Malinga to Taylor, FOUR!!, that's almost an afterthought from Taylor, he wanted to leave that short ball outside off alone, then had the time and the mind to dab it over the slip cordon, Kula is too wide and Taylor finally gets off the mark with a lovely late cut/steer
NEW ZEALAND:10.3  Malinga to Ryder, 1 run, driven powerfully and a diving mid off, keeps it to a single, lovely stop, that was another boundary
NEW ZEALAND:10.2 Malinga to Ryder, FOUR!!, Tharanga is not one of the best fielders in this Lankan team and it shows, he drops Ryder , the one-legged pull, trade-mark Ryder style shot, lifted his right leg up in the air and short arm jabbed it, it went high and Tharanga at square leg seemed to have lost it in the background, jumped a little late and just about parried it over the ball, could prove to be a pivotal moment in the game
NEW ZEALAND:10.2  Malinga to Ryder, wide, the slower one slips out of Malinga's hands, down leg, wide called
NEW ZEALAND:10.1  Malinga to Ryder, no run, short of length delivery on middle, Ryder shuffles across a tad and then blocks to legBowling PP has been taken and Malinga to continue. A dull phase of play this. Sri Lanka are giving nothing away and the Kiwi batsmen are taking their time to get their eye in before they can cash in later on

He had a word with Ryder who said to him - 'Son save them for the incoming men', you are a dead duck and dead duck he was. Perfect inswinger, landed on off and moved in off the seam to catch Guptill half cock, hit him low on the pad in front of all three stumps. Asad Rauf gave it out. Guptill has got out to Kulasekara many times like that. Guptill is a prime candidate for LBWs as he tends to play around his front pad after plonking forward. This time that tendency sends him back. Both the openers are gone now. Guptill lbw b Kulasekara 13(23) [4s-1] Kulasekara to Guptill, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!

NEW ZEALAND:6.2  Mathews to Brendon McCullum, out Caught by Mahela Jayawardene!! Mahela - 2, McCullum brothers - 0! Brendon McCullum's brother Nathan was the one who was involved in the heated moment earlier in the day when Mahela was given not-out. Now Mahela has taken a clean catch and Saheba has given it out. For such a fine player like Brendon McCullum, there was no need to play those deft dabs. He gets out a lot like that. Tried to open the face on that and guided it into 1st slips' hands. Mahela went with it with both hands and took it cleanly. Brendon McCullum made sure he waited, got the confirmation from upstairs and then only went. Nothing wrong with that. Amidst all this hoopla, a huge wicket for the Lankans that. Brendon McCullum c Mahela Jayawardene b Mathews 14(16) [4s-2] Mathews to Brendon McCullum, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Drama: Mahela has taken a catch and Brendon McCullum isn't moving an inch. The umpires are going upstairs. A little drink is being consumed by Guptill and Brendon McCullum.

SRI LANKA:0.1  Malinga to Guptill, wide, slides down leg and Sanga diving to his left could only get a glove on it, looked to the naked eye that it caught the thigh pad, but wide signalledGuptill and Brendon McCullum are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Malinga will open the attackSuch a short break. So short it was that poor Ajith - who generally has a big snack is left to contend with just one half hearted bite. And he is grumpy with it as well. Chill down Ajith. Still dinner to come. Right enough of the jokes as the Kiwi openers walk out. The blonde slinger Malinga has the ball. Mahela said there was some swing on offer, we will see. A couple of slips as Guptill gets ready to face the first ball.Mahela: We knew the wicket was not going to be easy, bit of spongy bounce. 240-250 is a good score, we ended up with 265 and we have bowlers who can pick up wickets at the start. We've heard that it may swing under lights, but we have not seen that. It was a good effort, no one was sure whether he took it cleanly. To be fair enough I wanted the third ump to have a look at it. If I felt he had taken it cleanly, I probably would have walked. I have not seen the footage though, but to me it looked a half-half effort (referring to the controversial Caught and Bowled decision that went in his favor).It has been a great contest between bat and ball. New Zealand had the perfect start when they sent back the openers with hardly anything on board. Tharanga was unlucky to be run out and Dilshan fell to a good ball from Southee. But any thoughts of further inroads were dented by Sri Lanka's batting walls - Sanga and Mahela. The duo consolidated and survived a good spell from the Kiwi bowlers. They hung in their despite the slow run rate and slowly built a partnership.
Mahela got a let-off when the third umpire denied Nathan McCullum a caught and bowled chance even though replays showed he caught it clean. Jayawardene made good use of the life as he went on to score a well made 66. Sangakkara carried on his good form, bringing up a well made century. The Lankans lost a few wickets after he went but a few lusty blows from the tail and useful runs from Angelo Mathews powered them to 265. The bowlers bowled well but have taken their own sweet time in doing so. They've completed their quota at 6:30 - 10 minutes before the scheduled start of the 2nd innings. Join us in a while for the chase. It promises to be a good one!4
SRI LANKA:49.6  Oram to Ajantha Mendis, no run, sticks to the short ball again, Ajantha Mendis goes well across to pull it behind square, gets beaten again, and this is certainly a challenging total, considering the kind of bowlers that Sri Lanka have

Muralitharan run out (N McCullum/Guptill/Oram) 7(3) [6s-1] Oram to Mathews, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!The third umpire has been called for, is Muralitharan run out over there?

Malinga c Brendon McCullum b Oram 6(4) [6s-1] Oram to Malinga, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:47.4  Oram to Malinga, SIX!!, the crowds love him in this part of the country, he plays for the Mumbai Indians and that's got the crowd on their feet, slapped a length ball with cross bat, a wild swing that, typical of a tailender, goes all the way to the long on boundary!

SRI LANKA:46.6  Southee to Kulasekara, out Caught by Guptill!! That's what I call judging the misjudged one! Banged in short, Kulasekara pulls it to deep mid wicket, Guptill had to judge the ball properly, it was coming from the crowd at the background, he overruns a bit and for a moment it looked like the ball would take his head along with it, but manages to pouch it with fingers pointing up. He indicated to his teammates that the ball swirled in the air, he has a smile on his face and it has been a nice comeback from the Kiwis.

SRI LANKA:45.4  N McCullum to Silva, out Caught&Bowled!! Oh my! Looked like he almost dropped that one. After being denied a spectacular catch off Jayawardene, he was expected to take this one, Silva chipped it to the left of N McCullum, he went in with both hands, the ball hits him hard and pops out, he does well to bend and go for it again, takes it on the second attempt with his left hand and smiling faces in the NZ camp. Wonder how he would have felt if he had spilt that dolly? Silva c and b N McCullum 3(5) N McCullum to Silva, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!

He came in when they lost their openers quickly, he steadied the ship and took responsibilities to up the ante when it was time, how long will he contuinue?
SRI LANKA:39.1  Oram to Sangakkara, FOUR!!, it's Oram's turn to face the agony! pitched on leg, too easy for someone who is batting in his nineties, just a tickle was the need of the hour, Sangakkara gets it right, into the fine leg boundary

SRI LANKA:38.4  Southee to Sangakkara, SIX!!, it's already hot and tough on the bowlers, and Sangakkara is turning the heat on and making life worse! Wonderful upper cut, it was a short ball, there was a man in the deep, makes no difference as long as he can clear the point boundary with such ease
SRI LANKA:38.3  Southee to Sangakkara, FOUR!!, width on offer and that's Sangakkara for you! gets down on his knees and slices it over point, a couple of bounces, the ball races to the point boundary

SRI LANKA:37.3  Oram to Mathews, 1 run, full and on the pads, flicked away to fine legWith Bennett off the field, the Kiwis are short of one fast bowler, it will be interesting to see how Rossco manages his bowlers.

SRI LANKA:37.2  Oram to Mathews, no run, banged in short, Mathews pulls, but straight to short mid wicket
SRI LANKA:37.1  Oram to Mathews, no run, back of a length and angled in, Mathews goes back and defends it, the fielder runs in and throws the ball at the stumps towards the bowler's end, totally unnecessaryJacob Oram [6.0-1-16-0] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:36.1  Southee to Mahela Jayawardene, out Lbw!! Alright, Nathan McCullum can point towards the dressing room now, Mahela has been given out LBW, he was a dead duck to be honest, pitched on off and middle, rapped in front of middle and it was going on to hit leg, no doubts in the minds of the third umpire, the on-field decision stays and Jayawardene walks back to the pavilion. Mahela Jayawardene lbw b Southee 66(90) [4s-6] Southee to Mahela Jayawardene, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!I told you, this batting powerplay is a funny passage of play. Jayawardene has been given out LBW, looked dead plumb, he has gone for the review.
SRI LANKA:36.1  Southee to Mahela Jayawardene, wide, this is poor stuff from the strike bowler! May be the heat has gotten the better of him, full and sliding well down the leg, good stop by the keeper
SRI LANKA:36.1  Southee to Mahela Jayawardene, wide, full and well down the leg stump, was a slower one as well, may be just wanted to loosen up a bit, wide signalledTim Southee [5.0-0-20-1] is back into the attackAlright, the most dangerous bowler has come in. I'm not talking about a Malinga or a Tim Southee or an Afridi, I'm talking about the batting powerplay. Wickets or runs? What do you think? I will go for the latter.
SRI LANKA:35.6  N McCullum to Sangakkara, no run, much closer to the off stump, Sangakkara gets behind the line and slaps it to the close in fielder on the off side
SRI LANKA:35.5  N McCullum to Sangakkara, FOUR!!, that's the shot of a man in tremendous form! He has scored 3 fifties already in the tournament, clears his front leg out of the way, creams it through point, wonderfully struck out of the middle of the blade

SRI LANKA:35.3  N McCullum to Sangakkara, 1 run, Sangakkara walks across and works it to square leg
SRI LANKA:35.2  N McCullum to Sangakkara, no run, shouts of 'Catch it', but falls well short, Sangakkara was in two minds, unsure whether to slice it over point or go for the sweep, ends up just chipping it in the air towards backward point, played it with soft hands, it lands in front of Taylor
SRI LANKA:35.1  N McCullum to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run, given some air, turning into Mahela Jayawardene, he backs away and steers it through cover for a singleNathan McCullum [6.0-0-30-0] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:34.3  Styris to Sangakkara, SIX!!, Gotta be the shot of the day! full and straight for Sangakkara, he gets under the ball and lofts it handsomely, straight over the bowler's head, the ball goes all the way, just lands in front of the sight screen, when he hits those kinda shots, you can't help but think 'Why are left handers more elegant to watch than right handers?'
SRI LANKA:34.2  Styris to Mahela Jayawardene, 1 run, short of length, Mahela Jayawardene pulls it to deep backward square, can't find the gap
SRI LANKA:34.1  Styris to Sangakkara, 1 run, Sangakkara works it wide of mid wicket, just a singleScott Styris [5.0-0-23-0] is back into the attackWith both batsmen going well, and with the ball being changed, expect one of these two to take on the bowlers and try to up the ante.

That spoils all the fun, wonderful batting, used all his years of experience, he knew that the third man was in and all he needed was a deft touch, it was slightly fuller and just outside the off stump, Mahela Jayawardene plays it with an angled bat, plays it very late, the slightest of touches was all that he needed, races away to the third man boundary

SRI LANKA:14.5  Oram to Mahela Jayawardene, no run, Oram is ambling in and bowling it on a short of length outside off, Mahela Jayawardene isn't tempted by that and lets it go

SRI LANKA:14.1  Oram to Sangakkara, no run, good length delivery on off stump, Sangakkara defends off the front-footOram is back on and I'm, Srivathsa done for the first innings. Will see you in the second dig. It will be the Chennai man - Karthik L - who is quite used to the heat and humidity to take you through till the next drinks break.An interesting snippet: Russel Arnold on air was saying that Avishka Gunawardene is the personal batting coach of Sangakkara. I remember him pretty well. He used to kiss the bat before facing every ball. He partnered Jayasuriya and hit the ball even harder sometimes than the great man. It is really curious and interesting to see such a sweet timer of the ball like a Sangakkara have a batting coach like Avishka - when you consider that he belted the ball to all corners of the ground.Time for drinks. It has been a very very hot day. The players will take three drinks breaks today I'm guessing. Sri Lanka have gotten over the initial setbacks and look good to make a substantial score. Their two best players are in the middle too.

SRI LANKA:13.3  Ryder to Sangakkara, FOUR!!, Sangakkara went back deep into his crease and got under that full delivery before creaming it over mid off, did not hit it as well as he would've liked to, yet since the mid off is inside, Sangakkara will get a boundary
SRI LANKA:13.3  Ryder to Sangakkara, no ball, if it was not a no-ball, it would have been a wide, very wide outside off, the field can't change, a free hit coming up

SRI LANKA:11.5  Bennett to Sangakkara, FOUR!!, Sangakkara is the most graceful of all the lefties that I have seen - especially when he plays the straight drive like that, a length ball, driven with a high front elbow, full face of the bat, hit the sweet spot of the bat and beat a sprawling dive from mid off, who is standing a lot squarer, wonderful stuff from the Lankan skipper, beautiful straight drive PS: When I meant lefties I have seen, I have taken into account only the straight drive by Sangakkara, even BC Lara and Ganguly were my favorites.
SRI LANKA:11.4  Bennett to Sangakkara, no run, Bennett is sweating profusely, he keeps it in the corridor of uncertainty, Sangakkara shoulders arms
SRI LANKA:11.3  Bennett to Sangakkara, no run, nicely punched back to Bennett, who stops it on his follow-through

SRI LANKA:9.6  Bennett to Sangakkara, 1 run, Sangakkara tried to hit that too hard, and ended up dragging it to fine leg, a low full toss, since Sangakkara played that with a closed face, he got only a single

SRI LANKA:8.6  Southee to Sangakkara, no run, in the channel, left alone
SRI LANKA:8.5  Southee to Sangakkara, FOUR!!, this one is an edge, a definite one and no second slip as well, Sangakkara pushed at it hard, if there was a second slip it would've been a dolly, instead it beats Bennett's desperate dive at third man, Southee does not like it one bit, so frustrating from his point of view to see an edge go to the fence, especially when you consider that he is toiling away in the heat and the humidity of Mumbai

SRI LANKA:7.2  Bennett to Mahela Jayawardene, no run, better delivery, short of length on off stump, Mahela Jayawardene is in behind it well
SRI LANKA:7.1  Bennett to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR!!, bad delivery first up, on the pads and as Simon Doull says, that's meat and drink for Mahela Jayawardene, flicked away past square leg, all he needed to was to beat the man and he did so in styleHamish Bennett, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackHere is Bennett who apparently does not like bowling with the new ball. Comes in as first change. Bit of Mohanty in his bowling action. Not quite the swing bowler like Mohanty, he is more of a hit the deck kind of bowler. Open chested, hustles and bustles in before leaping high in the air to deliver the ball.
SRI LANKA:6.6  Southee to Sangakkara, no run, angled across Sangakkara on a fuller length, he shoulders arms
SRI LANKA:6.5  Southee to Sangakkara, no run, that hit the splice off the bat as Sangakkara got forward to defend, Sangakkara looks at Southee and acknowledges that it was well bowled
SRI LANKA:6.4  Southee to Sangakkara, 2 runs, great stop by Big Jake at fine leg, Sangakkara played the leg glance well, it needed a dive and Jake put out his left hand and saved his side a couple of runs, in this heat and humidity, one has to commend the old man - if I may call him that - for putting in the effort
SRI LANKA:6.3  Southee to Sangakkara, no run, that was well left in the end, this is a magnificent wicket for the opening bowlers, nice pace, good carry and with that bounce too, perfect delivery in the channel, Sangakkara was unsure whether to play or not at that, then at the last moment tucked his bat under his arm and then lets it go
SRI LANKA:6.2  Southee to Sangakkara, no run, close to a wide, full and wide outside off, Sangakkara reached out and tried to square drive, he missed

SRI LANKA:5.6  Oram to Mahela Jayawardene, no run, still wider outside off, Mahela Jayawardene leaves 3 in a row
SRI LANKA:5.5  Oram to Mahela Jayawardene, no run, same line, same length, same delivery, same description
SRI LANKA:5.4  Oram to Mahela Jayawardene, no run, in the corridor of uncertainty, with a bit of bounce, Mahela Jayawardene shoulders arms
SRI LANKA:5.3  Oram to Mahela Jayawardene, no run, softly tapped to the vacant short leg area, Sangakkara isn't interested in the single, the quick one that is
SRI LANKA:5.2  Oram to Mahela Jayawardene, FOUR!!, slack work from Bennett at mid on, it was wristed to the right of him and despite the slide, he could not stop a regulation shot, lets it go through his hands, Simon Doull and Danny M were talking about him on how he does not like to bowl with the new ball, and immediately Bennett puts in a poor effort to allow Mahela Jayawardene to get off the mark

SRI LANKA:4.5  Southee to Sangakkara, no run, Southee holds his hands on his head as Sangakkara leaves one outside off, full and swung back in, it swung after Sangakkara shouldered arms, Baz moved to his right and collected it
SRI LANKA:4.4  Southee to Sangakkara, FOUR!!, too full on middle, Sangakkara the terrific timer of a cricket ball that he is, clips it wide of Franklin at mid on, who gives chase, but in vain as it goes away to the fence, even a slide was not enough to prevent the boundaryMahela Jayawardene, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:4.3  Southee to Dilshan, out Caught by Oram!! What a well planned, plotted and executed dismissal by Southee. He slowly walked back to his bowling crease. Took a few deep breaths before steaming in. Then went wide of the crease and angled it in to leg stump. Dilshan's eyes lit up when he saw that delicious offering. Thought that here is the chance to break the shackles and swung at it in his trade-mark style. He closed the face as he played that. A leading edge swirled way up into the Mumbai sky and Oram at third man settled under it. Big Jake won't drop that. And he pumps his fist for he knows how important a wicket that is. Terrific wicket for the Kiwis. Dilshan c Oram b Southee 3(15) Southee to Dilshan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:4.2  Southee to Dilshan, no run, full and on off stump, Dilshan shows the full face of the bat and punches it back to Southee, Dilshan is timing them well, but can't get it into the gap
SRI LANKA:4.1  Southee to Dilshan, no run, full delivery on off stump, Dilshan isn't flustered by the things that are happening at the other end and drives powerfully, but straight to the fielder at mid off
SRI LANKA:3.6  Oram to Sangakkara, no run, defended to the on sideSanga is alright. Guptill has hit direct. A full length dive from Sangakkara has saved him.
SRI LANKA:3.5  Oram to Sangakkara, FOUR!!, Sangakkara has been saved by the thinnest of margins, it was tapped to the left of Guptill at square leg, Sangakkara wanted the single, Dilshan was not so sure, sent him back, Guptill hit direct, Sangakkara made it back with a dive, it went to the third ump, who confirmed the same, the richochet runs away to the boundary as all the Kiwis were busy celebrating and no one kept a watch on the ball, close shave for the Lankan skipper
SRI LANKA:3.4  Oram to Sangakkara, no run, full and wide outside off, Sangakkara shoulders arms watchfully

SRI LANKA:3.1  Oram to Sangakkara, no run, another ripper from Oram, angled across Sangakkara on a short of length and drew Sangakkara into the forward defensive, as Sangakkara moved across to play that, it moved away with the angle and beat him, zipped through to the keeperKumar Sangakkara, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:2.6  Southee to Dilshan, out Tharanga Run Out!! One of the unluckiest ways to get out in cricket. And Tharanga has fallen that way. He was already two steps down the wicket as Southee was delivering the ball. Dilshan drove that beautifully, a well timed straight drive, Southee the athlete that he is, bent down to his right to deflect it to the leg stump at Tharanga's end. The long limbs of Southee doing the trick. Just touched the 4th finger of Southee's right hand and dislodged the bail. Tharanga who made a fine ton, in the last game walks back. Tharanga run out (Southee) 3(7)
SRI LANKA:2.5  Southee to Dilshan, no run, good carry through to Baz, it was full and it was wide outside off, Southee is getting it to swing and that moved away a fraction to beat the flashing blade of Dilshan, Baz appeals and then aborts it
SRI LANKA:2.4  Southee to Dilshan, no run, driven crisply, but straight to the fielder at mid off, Dilshan can't pick the gap
SRI LANKA:2.4  Southee to Dilshan, 5 wides, only Baz could get have gotten a finger-tip on that, I bet no other keeper could not even have gotten a hand on that, let alone a finger, Baz kicked his heels up and then leapt full length to prevent that monster of a bouncer from running away, all he could was get a tiny finger and parry it over the bar - in football it would've been a great save, here in cricket, it only means 4 runs to the opposition
SRI LANKA:2.3  Southee to Tharanga, 1 run, short of length outside off, no swing this time, Tharanga cuts it down to third man
SRI LANKA:2.2  Southee to Tharanga, no run, Southee is bowling it full to get some swing, on the stumps, Tharanga punches it back to Southee who gets his left hand and stops it on his follow-through

SRI LANKA:1.3  Oram to Dilshan, 2 runs, driven with one hand coming off the bat, Dilshan square drove away from the body and since it swung away, it caught the outer half of the bat and raced past cover
SRI LANKA:1.2  Oram to Dilshan, no run, real beaut! Oram with his height gets that to bounce from an awkward length, it landed on off, and left Dilshan as he tried to ride the bounce, Oram bowls that leg cutter well and he delivered it perfectly, kicked up from that back of a length and went past the groping blade of Dilshan
SRI LANKA:1.1  Oram to Tharanga, 1 run, this is a surprise move as Oram shares the new ball, Tharanga prods forward to defend and since he played with an angled bat it took the inner edge and rolled past his leg stump, a lucky escape for TharangaJacob Oram, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:0.6  Southee to Dilshan, no run, play and miss or a thrash and a miss, pitched up and moving away outside off, Dilshan went after it and it flew past the edge, definite swing for Southee and it will swing for a while, good start by Southee

SRI LANKA:0.1  Southee to Tharanga, leg byes, 2 runs, swings towards the pads and catches Tharanga's pads, another acrobatic stop by Baz, but he can only parry it to fine leg
SRI LANKA:0.1  Southee to Tharanga, wide, what a good stop by Baz, it went down the leg side and he flung himself acrobatically like a footie goalie to his right to save a boundaryTharanga and Dilshan are at the crease. Tharanga is on strike. Southee will open the attackHere we go shouts Mark Nicholas on air and we are set as well. Southee with a couple of slips in for him steams in. Tharanga is on strike. The pitch looks quite brownish. 41.6 degr
SRI LANKA:41.6 degrees  today and the players are sweating a lot. Definitely Southee will get some swing under these humid conditions. It is Srivathsa who is starting off proceedings.Different looks in the Kiwi camp: Daniel Vettori has a goatee and a small moustache which makes him look like Adolf Hitler. Jesse Ryder has a ginger beard while Styris, Nathan and Baz are clean shaven. PS: The Vettori comparison should be taken in the right spirit and not seen as something else.National anthems time: Good to see a young kid (the ones who accompany the cricketers) who is physically handicapped being taken into the ground in a wheelchair by Nathan McCullum. First up is the Sri Lankan anthem - 'Namo namo matha' - in Sinhalese. Mendis and Dilshan clear their throats as they recite it. It is a pretty lengthy anthem too. Next up is the Black Caps' one. And a melodious one as well. Some smattering of Kiwi supporters in the stands.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(w), Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor(c), Kane Williamson, Scott Styris, James Franklin, Nathan McCullum, Jacob Oram, Tim Southee, Hamish BennettSri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Silva, Angelo Mathews, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Muttiah MuralitharanSri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batTaylor: We would have batted first too, Vettori's absence gives an opportunity for someone to step up. Today is a big game leading into the quarter finals. Bennett comes in for Mills.Sangakkara: We are batting first, there may be some spongy bounce to start off with, but I guess it will do a lot more under lights. We have a settled side, we are playing Mendis as our second spinner, and we have 3 seamers in Malinga, Kulasekara and Mathews.Tony Greig is all set for the toss, the captains are out and Ross Taylor flips the coin.Guptill: We have put on some good performances at the top that have given the middle order some opportunities to hit over the top right from the time they have come in to bat. Sri Lanka are a good side, it is a warm day, and we need to keep the hydration right.Pitch report: This was the same pitch where NZ scored 358 a couple of days ago, but there is a bit more grass covering on the wicket. The ball may seam around initially and it would be a better option to bowl first feels Simon Doull.A warm welcome to the big game between Sri Lanka and New Zealand from the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Even though both teams have already qualified for the quarters, they would like to get a win under their belt and ensure that they face the weaker teams from Group B in the first of the knock out stages. Will the Sri Lankan bowlers spin a web around the Kiwi batsmen? Will Ross Taylor and Co. fire again to create some sort of an upset? This is Ajith, and I'll bring you all the action along with Ganesh, Karthik, Pradeep and Srivathsa. Stay tuned for more updates.Preview by Saurabh SomaniCompared to the upheavals going on in Group B, Group A looks very serene. The four quarter-finalists are the top four ranked teams, and none of the minnows have upset any of the teams. However, amongst Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand and Sri Lanka, there is still a lot of uncertainty over who will qualify in what place in the quarterfinals. However, the New Zealand-Sri Lanka match will determine to a large extent the fortunes of both teams involved.
The equation is clear-cut for Sri Lanka: If they win, they will finish second in Group A and if they lose they will finish fourth (This is considering the Pakistan-Australia match does not end in a tie or a no result). A win for New Zealand would see them finish first or second in the group, while a loss will see them third or fourth - with their exact spot dependent on the Australia-Pakistan result.
This will also be a match played in neutral territory, and both teams will be hoping to be back at the Wankhede in Mumbai in a couple of weeks time. To be there then, they have to start by being at their best today.New Zealand: Apart from their poor result against Australia, New Zealand have looked a different side to the one that got thumped 5-0 against India just over four months ago. They beat Kenya in a match that lasted less than 32 overs, beat Zimbabwe by 10 wickets, and beat Canada also by a handy margin. And then of course, there was that match against Pakistan, where the last few overs saw a Ross Taylor carnage that left the opposition seemingly too dazed to chase. It can be said that apart from Pakistan and Australia, New Zealand haven't faced tough opposition yet, and there will be some truth to that. However, a record of 1-1 is certainly better than they would have been expecting. Some key figures will be missing in action for New Zealand in Daniel Vettori and Kyle Mills, whom the Black Caps do not wish to risk ahead of the knock-out stages, which puts a greater onus on the batting to deliver. However, this is a good time to put the onus on the Kiwi batting since it has been delivering solid returns in this World Cup. Tim Southee has been in exceptional form for them and will have to lead the attack in Vettori's absence. So far he has netted 11 victims at an impressive economy rate of 3.4 and an average of just 13.45. If he can keep that up, New Zealand can look forward to taking some strong momentum into the quarter-finals with a win over a pre-tournament favourite.Sri Lanka: Touted as a pre-tournament favourite, they suddenly have no wins against major sides to show, with only one match left to play. That they have qualified for the knock-out stages will be little consolation, since Sri Lanka would have fully expected to be heading into the final match with 10 points instead of the 7 they are taking now. They were always playing catch-up in their defeat to Pakistan, and rain robbed cricket fans of what could have been a classic low-scoring duel with Australia. They have clobbered the minnows, but then in Group A, every established team has clobbered the minnows. Sri Lanka will need their lower middle order to assume more responsibility against stronger sides, which has been their only Achilles heel so far in the tournament. The bowling led by Malinga and Muralitharan looks potent, especially when you factor in at least one other spinner among Herath/Mendis to partner Murali on sub-continent pitches. Malinga has been a little like the Sehwag of bowling: capable of wrecking destruction on any surface, not conventionally orthodox, and with more than a hint of the maverick. Like New Zealand, Sri Lanka will also want to head into the quarter-finals with a good win under their belt. Given that seedings in Group B are still chaotic, Sri Lanka could very well draw India, in which case they would have to play their quarter-finals away from home in Ahmedabad, and a win in Mumbai just before that will certainly do their confidence a world of good.Watch Out For:Ross Taylor
In the last two matches, Ross Taylor's combined aggregate reads: 205 runs off 168 balls faced with one dismissal. Saying he's been in devastating form is understating it. Luckily for his side, the form has come just at the right time.Head to Head:In World Cups, Sri Lanka and New Zealand have met 7 times, with Sri Lanka winning four encounters and New Zealand winning three. Their last meeting was in the semi-final of the 2007 World Cup, which Sri Lanka won rather handily. New Zealand will event the score in more ways than one by winning here: they will have avenged the 2007 loss and they will have restored parity in their win/loss ratio against the Lankans.Quotes:"I'd like to sit down with people like Murali and Harbhajan and talk to them about how they went in getting it (the doosra) in their repertoire. But at the moment, I'm focussed at just winning games for New Zealand. I bowl a different type of delivery. It's not a doosra but its something else." - Nathan McCullum
"We love playing in front of our crowd. Their support really lifts us. But sometimes, not having a huge crowd and their expectations, may make things a bit easier." - Kumar Sangakkara.
