AUSTRALIA:45.1 45.1 Mohammed Shami to Faulkner, out Caught by Dhawan!! India win!

It is certainly not impossible seeing how this series has panned out.Cricket commentator Ayaz Menon tweets, "Cant think of another ODI series in which bowlers have got brutalised so much..."New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor tweets, "Amazing batting by @ImRo45 awesome to watch. #209"India 's 383 is the highest team score on this ground.When he reached 176, he went past Sachin Tendulkar and Herschelle Gibbs for the highest individual score against Australia.Rohit Sharma's 209 is the highest individual score at Bangalore. He went past Andrew Strauss, who made 158 during the 2011 WC match against India.Rohit Sharma also completed 1000 ODI runs for a calendar year in the course of his knock.Rohit Sharma hit 16 sixes and in the process went past Shane Watson for the most number of sixes hit in an innings. (Watson hit 15 sixes against Bangladesh).Stats:  Rohit Sharma became the 3rd player in ODI history to score a double-ton (after Tendulkar and Sehwag).Rohit: 'It is a wonderful feeling. When I went out to bat, I never knew I would get 200. But, scoring runs on this ground is easy. I only wanted to carry on from where I left in the last game. As you play, records will come. I only want my team to win. That is more important. It's coming off really well for me since Champions Trophy and I just want to keep the momentum going. No hard feelings with Virat. I am sure he will get a hundred in the next game.'India lost the out of form duo of Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh cheaply, and looked to be settling towards a middling score at best when Dhoni joined Rohit in the middle. Rohit first brought up his 4th ODI century and then changed gears drastically. He was to go on to pulverise the Australian bowlers as he proceeded to become only the third player (all Indians) to go past 200. Dhoni chipped in with his bit and India ended up with a massive 383 runs on the board. Will the shell-shocked Australians give a befitting reply? Join us for the reply in a short while from now.Magnificent effort from the Indians and the festive crowd have got their money's worth already. India knew that they needed a big score, Rohit and Dhawan started off well adding another century stand, their 6th in ODIs. There was a slight rain delay, upon resumption, Dhawan fell to Doherty and Rohit shattered the crowd by running out local hero, Virat Kohli for a duck. He needed to make up for it and how well has he responded.4

Rohit Sharma is on strike. Clint McKay will open the attackThe players are walking out to the centre. All in readiness for another cracker. McKay to start off proceedings. Here we go with the first ball....Watson: "It is a challenge bowling these days. The two new balls and four fielders out has made it a bit difficult for the bowlers. Not a strange decision of recalling Johnson back. He has been bowling well and has to look after himself in the coming months. Yes, we can hope for 400 but only when we are batting but not while we are bowling."Matty Hayden who is doing television work for this series minces no words when asked about the recalling of Mitchell Johnson. "Calling it a strange decision would be too political, its a ridiculous decision. It speaks poorly of our culture when we are playing the decider. With the Ashes still 20 days away, give me one reason, one as to why Johnson has been called back." Strong words from the big man, and most would agree with him. Diplomacy never Matty Hayden's strong point!Teams:India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Vinay Kumar, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed ShamiAustralia (Playing XI): Phillip Hughes, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Clint McKay, Xavier Doherty, Nathan Coulter-NileDhoni: "This ground is always good to chase on and we would have batted second as well. The team that plays well will win today. The pitch will remain the same. There is one change Vinay comes in for Mishra."Bailey: "We are having a bowl. It looks a good wicket. This has been a high scoring ground so it will be another high scoring game. We will look to restrict them and chase it down. It is an important game. Coulter-Nile comes in for Johnson."Australia have won the toss and have opted to fieldBut in a strange decision Australia have recalled Mitchell Johnson back, to prepare for the Ashes series. He won't be playing today which is a big relief to the Indian batsmen, especially to a certain Yuvraj Singh. With Johnson out, it will be a tossup between Nathan Coulter-Nile and Moises Henriques to replace the left-armer. The toss and teams will happen shortly, don't go anywhere, stay tuned, we'll have all the updates.Pitch Report: "There is a tinge of green grass. But it is not live grass. There is a bit of a moisture due to the rains. The pitch is slightly damp and the team that wins the toss would like to bowl first. There is some rain predicted, so that will be another reason to bowl first", says Ravi ShastriBailey's captaincy has been spot-on as well. He has converted Mitchell Johnson into the Mitchell Johnson of old - who used to swing the ball at pace and consistently hit 150kmph. Johnson has taken 7 wickets in the series so far and has constantly been a menace to the Indian batsmen. He in particular has had the measure of Yuvraj Singh who has really struggled against the left-armer. The transformation in Johnson can be attributed to the confidence given by Bailey who has given him the licence to bowl full-throttle without worrying about anything else.Great credit for Australia's performance should go to their laidback, happy-go-lucky, ever-smiling and charismatic skipper, the Tasmanian, George Bailey. Before this series he had played 28 ODIs and had scored 1061 with only one ton. This series his scores are - 85, 92*, 43, 98 and 156 which has resulted in 474 runs - the most by any batsman in a bilateral series. Some turnaround, eh?Before the start of the series, no-one gave the visitors a chance. Things looked bleak when regular skipper Michael Clarke pulled out. A pretty inexperienced team was there for the taking, all the experts opined. They were lambs to the slaughter said some, but going into the final game at Bengaluru the series is tied at 2-2 and those two Indian wins were no ordinary wins - they chased down 350+ both times. They say, never write off an Aussie side and this side is no different.Kohli needs 81 runs today to break Sir Vivian Richards' record for the quickest to 5000 ODI runs. Today's game is at Bengaluru for which Kohli plays in the Indian T20 League. He knows the pitch and the conditions like the back of his hand. What are the odds on him getting the 81 runs and becoming the fastest to get to 5000 ODI runs? It would take a brave man to bet against him today, especially if India are chasing.Kohli's batting has given the Aussies headaches and it has led to their captain George Bailey calling for ways to dismiss the young Indian batsman. Bailey was not too concerned about his side inability to defend 350-360, but more worried on how to stop the juggernaut that is called Kohli. "I'd like to find a way to get Kohli out. That's probably my first thought. I don't think we should read too much into 360 and 350. It's quite clear that given the two new balls and the four (fielders) out, that maybe it is the new 300-290. We're disappointed not to win. But we're not making too much of the score," he said.Coming to Virat Kohli, he set both the chases on fire with his 16th and 17th ODI tons, the first one resulting in the fastest ODI ton by an Indian while the second was the third fastest. Those two innings led to no less an authority like Sunil Gavaskar to say that Kohli can surpass Tendulkar's record of ODI tons which stands at 49. Here is what Gavaskar had to say about Kohli: "But the manner in which Virat is batting, the record for 49 hundreds looks possible," he said. "Now Virat needs 32 more hundreds to go and the number of ODIs India play he can do it. This cricketing season itself, Virat can get to 20 or 22 hundreds."This ODI series has seen it all - the death of the ODI bowler being the most relevant and significant outcome to have come out of the series. Apart from that, we have seen India chase two 350+ scores successfuly - a record in a bilateral series - which has never happened before. Further affirmation of the fact that Virat Kohli is one of the best batsmen in the world, if not the best and a certain George Bailey's resurgence.PreviewIndia will yet again rely on their batting firepower as they seek to clinch the one-day series against an equally-determined Australia when the two teams clash in the seventh and final match on Saturday in what promises to be another high-scoring thriller. After two successive washouts in Ranchi and Cuttak, India bounced back to level the series 2-2 in Nagpur with yet another superlative show by their batsmen, who chased down a mammoth 351-run target. The incredible run chase brought back memories of India's magnificent victory in Jaipur when they chased a stiff target of 360, achieving the second highest successful run chase ever in ODI history. The bowlers of both the sides are under tremendous pressure on flat batting tracks as despite the two washouts, more than 2500 runs have been scored so far. Even a score of 350 cannot be considered a cushion and Saturday's match is also likely to be another high-scoring tussle with the wicket at M Chinnaswamy stadium traditionally being a batting-friendly wicket.The Indians, however, will find the going a little easier on the morrow as Australia's pace spearhead Mitchell Johnson will sit out of the match as he is returning home to prepare for the Ashes. India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be hoping that his young teammates can maintain the tempo to turn the tables on the Australians who have won two seven-game series in the past against the hosts. Among the batsmen, Virat Kohli and opener Shikhar Dhawan are the top-scorers for the hosts as they have batted brilliantly. Dhoni himself has been a solid batsman in the middle-order.Opener Rohit Sharma has also been instrumental in India's good fight with his partnerships with Dhawan and the hosts would look forward to the openers to provide yet again a solid start.Dhoni himself will be looking to repeat the Mohali performance where he scored a brilliant century to help India recover and post a challenging 300-plus total even as that was chased successfully by the visitors. The concern for India is the middle-order where Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh are yet to come up with an innings of substance in this series and on Saturday is time for the two to make up for the earlier failures. They have struggled against the pace and bounce extracted by Australian bowlers, especially Mitchell Johnson. Dhoni has the option of bringing in Ambati Rayadu but the Indian think tank may not want to tinker with the combination.On the bowling front, the Indian bowlers' economy rate has gone for a toss in the batting-friendly conditions. Off-spinner R Ashwin, who grabbed 29 wickets in the four-Test series against Australia in February-March, has taken some heavy punishment from the in-form Australian batsmen, especially by skipper George Bailey.Leg-spinner Amit Mishra, who played his first game at Nagpur, gave away 78 runs in 10 overs without taking a wicket.India's pace battery, consisting of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Jaydev Unadkat and R Vinay Kumar, has also been expensive and failed to stem the flow of runs. Dhoni has the option of using part-timers like Yuvraj Singh and Raina to bowl middle overs, but the field restrictions under the new ODI rules have made it difficult for him to toss the bowl to them. It remains to be seen whether Ishant Sharma will be given another chance to redeem his poor display in the series as he was hammered for 30 in the 'death' over at Mohali.Australia too have enjoyed a splendid batting effort. Bailey has tormented the Indians as he is the top run-getter in the series, while dangerman Shane Watson came out all blazing guns by scoring a century in the last match.Australian batsmen have taken Indian bowlers to the cleaners and managed to restrict them to make early inroads. Bailey reckons his team has enough quality to clinch the series third time in a row. The visitors, like India, have plenty to worry about with their bowling department not living up to expectation. Nevertheless, their speedsters have exposed some chinks with their short-ball attack.The Australian bowlers, like the hosts, have struggled to contain the Indian batsmen. It will come down to bowlers' making less mistakes and whichever team does that better, will have a better chance to walk away with the series victory.The series-win will boost the Australians ahead of the home Ashes series against England, starting later this month.Teams:Australia (From): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Shane Watson, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Clint McKay, Xavier Doherty, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Moises Henriques, Callum FergusonIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Vinay Kumar, Ambati Rayudu, Jaydev UnadkatLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
