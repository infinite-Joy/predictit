Matt Henry will open the attackThe players are out there. Henry to begin..Earlier, the Pakistani pacers feasted on the extra bounce on offer. Plenty of dismissals were of short deliveries which lifted awkwardly. New Zealand didn't help their cause either with an array of rash shots being exhibited. So all in all, in this first innings, both teams were trying to outdo the other in mediocrity. But the visitors showed they can't be matched. 280 looks plenty on this wicket. Will require some doing to get there. Join us in a short while for Pakistan's reply..I still can't believe this. Weren't the Kiwis 99/6 at one stage? And yet, they have recovered dramatically. Or rather, been allowed to recover. A masterclass from Pakistan - in how to let it all slip. Inexplicable stuff. Just when the pacers were ruling the roost, Azhar decided to go with spin. And that's where the partnership between Santner and Nicholls started to flourish. Take nothing away from the duo though. They were heroic in the way they kept their cool. But still, that's what it comes down to - should they have been allowed to?4

NEW ZEALAND:38.4 Irfan to Mitchell Santner, out Caught by Sarfraz!! Why wasn't this done earlier? Kept feeding the partnership with some rubbish spin bowling rather than getting the quicks on. Irfan back into the attack, and straightaway pays dividends. He does what he's been doing all day long i.e. troubling batsmen with bounce. Lifts spongily from a short of length, lobs off the top-edge of Santner's pull, and straight towards Sarfraz who had no problems despite the ball swerving in the wind.

NEW ZEALAND:26.6 Imad Wasim to Mitchell Santner, 2 runs, that's been lobbed off a thick top-edge, mid-off is running back, long-on is running to his right, will anyone get there? Oh brilliant effort.

NEW ZEALAND:25.3 Irfan to Mitchell Santner, no run, short of length delivery outside off, steered to backward point
NEW ZEALAND:25.2 Irfan to Mitchell Santner, 2 runs, why isn't Sarfraz upto the stumps? This could have been a run-out opportunity but for his laziness. Clipped through mid-wicket, they come back for two but are caught off-guard by some quick work from the mid-wicket fielder. He ran across, put in a convoluted slide to stop, and rifled a brilliant throw back in at the striker's end. A direct-hit would have definitely been out. However, even if Sarfraz had got there and taken the bails off, it could have been close. But he didn't
NEW ZEALAND:25.1 Irfan to Mitchell Santner, no run, nudges this short of length delivery beside the pitch
NEW ZEALAND:24.6 Amir to Mitchell Santner, 1 run, Sarfraz gave his absolute best to reach that, but he had no chance in hell. Top-edged pull shot, lobs away behind square on the on-side and lands well away from the keeper's dive
NEW ZEALAND:24.5 Amir to Mitchell Santner, no run, rising steeply from a short of length, but the line was well outside off, Santner comfortably sways inside the line while crouching
NEW ZEALAND:24.4 Amir to Mitchell Santner, FOUR, that's so well timed, despite hitting Amir on the boot in his followthrough, it comfortably races to the ropes. A bit too full from Amir, Santner presses forward and punches it straight back. Leaves Amir a bit ginger. Hobbling a little

NEW ZEALAND:22.4 Amir to Mitchell Santner, no run, now nips the other way. This is a real examination. Angled in and holds its line on off, takes the outside edge as Santner prodded forward to defend, and carries on the half-volley to Sarfraz who dived to his left
NEW ZEALAND:22.3 Amir to Mitchell Santner, no run, he's left that on length. Don't think that was the original intention though. Veers back in from a length outside off, Santner had already decided to leave. Must have breathed a sigh of relief after watching it fly over the bails
NEW ZEALAND:22.2 Amir to Mitchell Santner, no run, length ball around off, forward and blockedMitchell Santner, left handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:22.1 Amir to Ronchi, out Caught by Sarfraz!! There you go. Just too many strokes. It's like they have decided to jump off the cliff together. Goes flashing at a slightly short delivery angling away outside off. He is undone by the extra bounce which has been on offer all day. And nicks it through to the keeper. Ronchi c Sarfraz b Amir 5(7) [4s-1]Amir to Ronchi, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
NEW ZEALAND:21.6 Irfan to Henry Nicholls, no run, you can't play that. Just can't. A rip-snorter. Bouncing steeply from a short of length outside off. Nicholls moves across looking to fend it off, it whizzes past his outside edge

NEW ZEALAND:20.6 Amir to Ronchi, FOUR, the shots keeps flowing from Kiwi blades. Getting your eye in, anyone? Pitched up and angled away wide of off, the length was full enough to warrant having a go. Ronchi leans across, not much feet, and blazes it through the covers
NEW ZEALAND:20.5 Amir to Ronchi, no run, pushed across the right-hander on a fullish length, Ronchi isn't interestedLuke Ronchi, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:20.4 Amir to Corey Anderson, out Caught by Sarfraz!! Oh, appalling cricket. Every ball he faced, he looked like getting out. And now the inevitable has transpired. Can anyone please explain this approach, because I ain't got a clue. Back of a length delivery outside off, Anderson tries to punch it through the off-side on the front foot, ended up playing well away from the body and edged it behind. Corey Anderson c Sarfraz b Amir 10(19) [4s-1]Amir to Corey Anderson, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
NEW ZEALAND:20.3 Amir to Corey Anderson, 2 runs, sliced over mid-off. Anderson is living on the edge here. Short delivery outside off, he attempts an ambtious flat-batted pull, the bat turns in his hands, spoons it in the air. Enough on it to clear the infield
NEW ZEALAND:20.2 Amir to Corey Anderson, no run, length delivery angling in, meets a steadfast forward defence
NEW ZEALAND:20.1 Amir to Henry Nicholls, 1 run, picks the short of length delivery from wide of off, nudges it in front of mid-on. His trigger-shuffle makes it possible

NEW ZEALAND:18.4 Amir to Corey Anderson, 1 run, whipped off the hips behind square
NEW ZEALAND:18.3 Amir to Corey Anderson, byes, FOUR, that's took off like a plane from the runway. Zooms up from halfway down the pitch, whirs over Anderson's attempted pull, and over the leaping Sarfraz as well.
NEW ZEALAND:18.2 Amir to Henry Nicholls, 1 run, even wider outside off with this short of length ball, Nicholls stretches out to reach and chops it behind point down to third man

NEW ZEALAND:17.6 Anwar Ali to Corey Anderson, no run, oh jeez! That's a ridiculous shot - or attempted one - at this stage. Short ball angling well wide of off, Anderson still tries to pull it. Couldn't get near. Would have been much better off looking for a square cut
NEW ZEALAND:17.5 Anwar Ali to Corey Anderson, no run, angled away on a short of length, flat-batted to mid-off. Mistimed it completely, perhaps off the bottom of the bat
NEW ZEALAND:17.4 Anwar Ali to Henry Nicholls, 1 run, short ball at 125ks, pulled firmly to deep mid-wicket. Anwar Ali would be well advised to pitch it up. Doesn't have the pace to trouble batsmen with his short balls. He has already reaped rewards with two fullish deliveries. Stick to it
NEW ZEALAND:17.3 Anwar Ali to Henry Nicholls, no run, short of length outside off, punched to cover
NEW ZEALAND:17.2 Anwar Ali to Corey Anderson, leg byes, 1 run, clipped away behind square. Actually he didn't get any bat on it. Dribbled away off the thigh padThere are two slips waiting for a mistake

NEW ZEALAND:16.3 Riaz to Corey Anderson, no run, lifting sharply from a short of length outside off, Anderson doesn't bother
NEW ZEALAND:16.3 Riaz to Corey Anderson, wide, oopsy, he's completely lost control with this bumper. Well down leg
NEW ZEALAND:16.2 Riaz to Corey Anderson, no run, you can just sense the energy from Pakistan. They know that the iron is hot, now is the time to strike. Venomous short ball, slightly outside off, Anderson drops his gloves and sways away from the line
NEW ZEALAND:16.2 Riaz to Corey Anderson, wide, bumper down the leg-side, Anderson hunches slightly to sit under it
NEW ZEALAND:16.1 Riaz to Henry Nicholls, 1 run, short with ample width on offer, slapped down to third man
NEW ZEALAND:15.6 Anwar Ali to Corey Anderson, no run, angled away outside off, left aloneCorey Anderson, left handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:15.5 Anwar Ali to Elliott, out Bowled!! He's done it again. Oh Anwar Ali, what a ripper! That's an even better delivery than the one which got Williamson, got it to jag back in sharply from a fullish just outside off. Elliott, like Williamson, left a huge gap while attempting a drive. The ball sneaked through it, and pegged off stump back. Elliott b Anwar Ali 0(2)Anwar Ali to Elliott, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
NEW ZEALAND:15.4 Anwar Ali to Elliott, no run, another in-cutter, this time from a back of a length closer to off, Elliott chops it onto pad off the inside edgeGrant Elliott, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:15.3 Anwar Ali to Williamson, out Bowled!! I can't even begin to explain how big a wicket is this. The calming influence of Williamson has been taken out of the equation. Loose stroke, something which you don't quite associate with him. Fraction full outside off, Williamson aims a drive, tries to play it away from the body leaving a huge bat-pad gap, nips in slightly to take a thick inside edge and sends the leg-stump for a walk. Williamson b Anwar Ali 10(17)Anwar Ali to Williamson, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
NEW ZEALAND:15.2 Anwar Ali to Henry Nicholls, 1 run, angled in towards middle on a short of length from round the wicket, Nicholls shuffles across and helps the pull down to fine leg
NEW ZEALAND:15.1 Anwar Ali to Williamson, 1 run, holds its line just outside off, takes the outside edge, but doesn't carry. Williamson did well actually to loosen his grip after knowing that he would be defeated by the movement. Meant that it went straight down. Hafeez at slip couldn't collect it cleanly allowing a singleThe players are having drinks out there! It's been hostile stuff from the Pakistani pacers. Have got the Kiwis hopping and ducking for cover.
NEW ZEALAND:14.6 Riaz to Henry Nicholls, no run, oh, that's close isn't it? Looked very good to me in real time. But the appeal died down pretty quickly. An inside edge maybe? The slower ball from Riaz, fooled Nicholls as he tried to keep it out and struck him on the pad in line with middle. The only thing that could have saved him was an inside edge.

NEW ZEALAND:11.6 Anwar Ali to Henry Nicholls, 1 run, driven through the covers for a single
NEW ZEALAND:11.6 Anwar Ali to Henry Nicholls, wide, Anwar doesn't seem too amused with the call. He reckons that Nicholls walked well across the stumps. And he has a point. Banged in short outside off, Nicholls again looks for a pull but bails out and up go the umpire's arms seeing the line
NEW ZEALAND:11.5 Anwar Ali to Henry Nicholls, no run, looked like Nicholls was deceived by the lack of pace here. Through with the pull too early. Tried to fetch it from well outside off, but failed to connect

NEW ZEALAND:9.2 Anwar Ali to Henry Nicholls, no run, a chance has gone down at slip. Hafeez it is. Nice head-high catch, he grabbed at it and down she went. A good length ball angled away outside off, Nicholls is drawn into a loose drive away from the body, takes the outside edge and should have been number three down
NEW ZEALAND:9.1 Anwar Ali to Henry Nicholls, FOUR, Anwar Ali introduces himself with a half-volley outside off. Like pressing the release valve after all the pressure. Nicholls lays into it.

NEW ZEALAND:8.5 Irfan to Williamson, no run, hops on the crease before jabbing it towards mid-on
NEW ZEALAND:8.4 Irfan to Williamson, 2 runs, again that back-foot drive from Williamson. This time he had both feet off the pitch while playing it to ride the short of length delivery. Hits the gap between cover-point and backward point. Should have been three there as it was a long chase for the pursuing fielders but the batsmen opt for extra caution. The urgency wasn't there

NEW ZEALAND:6.6 Irfan to Henry Nicholls, FOUR, this will convince Irfan further that pitching up is futile. Actually the length wasn't the problem as much as the line. It ended up on Nicholls's pads. He effortlessly whips it wide of mid-on for some easy runs
NEW ZEALAND:6.5 Irfan to Henry Nicholls, no run, there's nothing being pitched anywhere near the batsman's half. Everything down halfway. Nicholls hops again and taps it towards point

NEW ZEALAND:6.3 Irfan to Henry Nicholls, FOUR, now this sends a message. A message that I am not intimidated by all this. Well directed short ball gunning for the throat of the batsman, Nicholls rolls his wrists on the pull to keep it along the carpet and hits it behind square.

NEW ZEALAND:5.4 Amir to Henry Nicholls, no run, slightly back of a length just outside off, Nicholls moves inches forward and blocks

NEW ZEALAND:5.2 Amir to Latham, out Caught by Sarfraz!! Pakistan are very upbeat about a review. Plenty of fielders suggesting to Azhar that he should go for it. And the captain obliges. So what have we got here. The thing in contention here is if Latham has gloved one through to the keeper. Not much evident on Hot Spot. Oh wait, RTS has cleared the picture. Big spike as the ball went past glove. Latham sees it and is already halfway to the hutch. Again a short ball doing the trick. Whirs off the pitch, beats Latham for pace as he attempted to pull it from over his right shoulder, caught a bit of glove as it flew through to Sarfraz. He knew it straightaway. So did Latham. Latham c Sarfraz b Amir 11(15) [4s-1]Amir to Latham, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
NEW ZEALAND:5.1 Amir to Latham, 2 runs, slanted into middle and leg, Latham flicks it nicely through the mid-wicket region. Didn't really turn his wrists furiously to send it all the wayKane Williamson, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:4.6 Irfan to Guptill, out Caught by Riaz!! Irfan has his retribution. The towering pacer has undone Guptill with a lifter. Short ball well directed towards Guptill's right shoulder. He tries to pull it away but is slightly rushed. Also got big on him, took a thick top-edge and ballooned in front of fine leg. Riaz rushes forward, steadies himself and plucks it. Guptill c Riaz b Irfan 11(17) [4s-1 6s-1]Irfan to Guptill, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

NEW ZEALAND:4.4 Irfan to Guptill, no run, Irfan responds with a short of length delivery, fended away into the off-side
NEW ZEALAND:4.3 Irfan to Guptill, SIX, and bang! He's clubbed that like a golfer in the driving range. What a swing of the willow. Seemed like Guptill had decided as the bowler was running in that this one has to go. Gets it in the slot, clears his front leg and swipes it over wide mid-off. Huge hit
NEW ZEALAND:4.2 Irfan to Guptill, no run, length ball aiming for the top of off, Guptill circumspectly blocks it beside the pitch

NEW ZEALAND:3.2 Amir to Latham, wide, attempts a bumper, but bangs it slightly too short. Doesn't need to on this deck which has bounce aplenty. Latham simply drops his wrists and lets it pass. In fact, on second look, the wide call seems very harsh. Wasn't as high to warrant the extra
NEW ZEALAND:3.1 Amir to Latham, no run, back of a length and banking in towards middle, tucked to square leg
NEW ZEALAND:2.6 Irfan to Guptill, no run, so far so good from Guptill. Leaving them alone outside off. Just get a feeling that sooner or later, he'll have a big waft at one
NEW ZEALAND:2.5 Irfan to Latham, 1 run, straying on the hips, glanced down towards fine leg
NEW ZEALAND:2.4 Irfan to Latham, FOUR, beautiful. Slightly overpitched outside off, Latham gets a good stride towards the ball and punches it through extra-cover. The balance, the timing, everything was there
NEW ZEALAND:2.3 Irfan to Latham, no run, banged in on a short of length in the channel, clipped in front of square leg

NEW ZEALAND:1.2 Amir to Latham, no run, pitched up and holding its line on off, Latham presses forward on the drive to mid-off

NEW ZEALAND:1.1 Amir to Latham, no run, skidding on from a length on middle, thuds into Latham's pad as he misses his flick. Would have gone down leg comfortably and hence no real appeal
NEW ZEALAND:1.1 Amir to Latham, wide, slips one way down the leg-side to start with, no way Latham was going to connect with his glanceMohammad Amir, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
NEW ZEALAND:0.6 Irfan to Guptill, no run, pushed across the right hander on a goodish length, Guptill prefers to let it go
NEW ZEALAND:0.5 Irfan to Guptill, FOUR, flashed away! The first real loosener and boy, didn't Guptill eat it alive. Short and wide, throws his bat at it and slashes it past cover-point
NEW ZEALAND:0.4 Irfan to Guptill, no run, utterly beaten for pace. Slippery back of a length delivery skidding on after pitching in line with middle, Guptill is late to get his bat down to defend. Whizzes through to the keeper passing over the bails

NEW ZEALAND:0.1 Irfan to Guptill, no run, he's left a length ball that has pitched middle and swung back in. How lucky is Martin Guptill. Bounces over the stumps. Might have expected to go away with the arm but it came back in. Evoked some big chirps from the fieldersGuptill and Latham are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Irfan will open the attackThings seem to be in readiness for play to get underway. Already a good crowd in, perhaps starved of some ODI action. Here's Irfan running inI hate to say it, but I did tell you that bowling first looked a lucrative option. Also, there won't be an all left-arm pace attack for Pakistan. Anwar Ali has been included. Actually, the visitors have gone in with 4 pacers for this one. Hearing that Shoaib Malik is missing out due to some sort of foot injury. Not yet confirmed though.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Babar Azam, Sohaib Maqsood, Imad Wasim, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad IrfanNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Corey Anderson, Henry Nicholls, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent BoultPakistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldThis pitch seems to be an interesting one. There were reports coming in that it was hard with a tinge of green on the surface. I learn that even the weather is overcast today morning. Needless to say that a strong wind will be blowing throughout. Come on, it's called Windy Wellington for a reason. Doesn't sound like bad conditions to have a bowl first. Let's see how the toss unfolds..Pakistan have some reinforcements themselves. There's a new captain for a start with Azhar Ali settling into the role in the ODI setup. He's already endured a rocky preliminary phase. After initial objections against the inclusion of Mohammad Amir, Azhar now insists on moving on. What is also strikingly apparent with one glance on their squad is the number of left-armers. How often has an ODI attack consisted of all left-arm pacers? Must be an interesting stat. Highly likely that the visitors offer one today.Good morning and welcome everyone to our live coverage. ODI cricket returns to the Basin Reserve after nearly a decade. It also marks the start of a 3-match series which gives the hosts another opportunity to evaluate their reserves with several big names not available.Preview:Pakistan will see the three-match One-Day International (ODI) series against New Zealand as an opportunity to improve their record in the 50-over format, which has been poor for the last couple of years. However, they face a tough opposition in New Zealand, who will be hoping to get off to a winning start in the first game at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on Monday (January 25).Pakistan won the ODI series in New Zealand in 1994 and 2011 and will look to repeat that. However, it is easier said than done as New Zealand, despite missing a number of key players, still look a formidable outfit and the hosts will be also buoyed by their come-from-behind 2-1 win in the recently-concluded Twenty20 International (T20I) series.Ross Taylor is out with a side strain while Tim Southee and Brendon McCullum are still recovering from foot and back injuries respectively. It'll be important for the New Zealand players to grab the opportunities presented to them. With McCullum set to retire, Tom Latham has a chance to establish himself as the preferred opener. McCullum is expected to join the squad for the final game of the series.However, the focus is going to be on the bowlers in the first game as the pitch at the venue is expected to be full of runs. Both sides have bowlers capable of turning the game and it'll be interesting to see which bowling unit comes out on top. New Zealand have Trent Boult Matt Henry, Adam Milne and Mitchell McClenaghan at their disposal while Pakistan have Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz in their arsenal.What will worry the Pakistan think-tank more is the form of their batting unit. Umar Akmal isn't part of the squad and the visitors will need the likes of Mohammed Hafeez, Shoaib Malik and Azhar Ali to step up. Ahmed Shahzad's form is a big worry for the team."The wicket looks quite hard and the wind factor is there, so we'll try and figure out a combination that will suit these conditions," acknowledged Ali ahead of the game.After Ali threatened to step down from captaincy if Amir was included in the squad, he now seems to have moved on. "Whatever my stance was, my job is to lead this side and keep harmony in the dressing room," he said. "We are all united and keen for this challenge. We should not discuss more about it. We've moved on."If Pakistan can click as unit, New Zealand will have a tough time taking on the visitors but, for now, they walk into the contest as favourites.Teams:Pakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Azhar Ali(c), Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Imad Wasim, Wahab Riaz, Anwar Ali, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Irfan, Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Rahat Ali, Sohaib Maqsood, Zafar GoharNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Corey Anderson, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, Colin Munro, Henry Nicholls, BJ WatlingLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
