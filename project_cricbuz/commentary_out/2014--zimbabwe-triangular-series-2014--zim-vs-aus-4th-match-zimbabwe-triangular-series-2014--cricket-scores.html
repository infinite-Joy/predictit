ZIMBABWE:43.3 Faulkner to Chigumbura, no run, yorker, dug out by Chigu
ZIMBABWE:43.2 Faulkner to Utseya, 3 runs, that's a dreadful ball from Fauklner considering the field he's got.

NOT OUT flashes, much to the delight of this capacity crowdRun-out check sent upstairs, but I think Chigu is safe! Oh hang on, did the bat bounce after hitting the ground?

ZIMBABWE:38.6 Starc to Utseya, wide, there was a noise as the ball passed the batsman, but umpire Dar calls it a wide. Maybe it kissed the thigh pad.

Nothing but a short of length delivery on the off stump, Masakadza is lazy to move his feet, tries to defend but the ball beats the inside edge and the off-pole goes cartwheeling! Well, Masakadza suggests as if it kept low a touch but it didn't. It was just a mistake by the batsman. H Masakadza b Starc 18(35) [4s-1 6s-1]Starc to H Masakadza, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Here we go with the first ball...It is now upto the Zimbabwean batsmen to show application and chase down this target. They are not going to get another opportunity like this to beat the Aussies. Will they be able to pull off an upset win? Can the Aussies defend this total? Join us back in a few minutes to find out....Zimbabwe have made full use of the conditions. The pitch started to turn as early as the second over. Nyumbu started it all, he got rid of Finch. The Aussies simply could not handle the turn and bounce. Utseya, Williams and Waller supported each other well. They scalped 6 wickets between them. Clarke was the main man for Australia as he was anchoring the innings while other rallied around him. He got to a well compiled fifty, but had to walk off the field with a hamstring injury. By the looks of it, the injury doesn't seem serious as he came out to bat in the last over. Haddin and Cutting hit few meaty blows to propel the score past 200. It is still their lowest total against Zimbabwe.4

The Australian openers have walked out to the middle.Teams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Tino Mawoyo, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w), Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura(c), Malcolm Waller, Prosper Utseya, Donald Tiripano, John Nyumbu, Tendai ChataraAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Mitchell Marsh, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Ben Cutting, Mitchell Starc, Nathan LyonChigumbura: "There was a plan to bowl first so hopefully we can do well. We have to improve on our batting. I think we can do better than the last game. Just one change for us - Tiripano comes in for Vitori."Clarke: "I would like to bat first. The wicket looks pretty good. It is a nice day in Harare and hopefully we will be able to put up a good score. It is good to be back. Selection is a bit of problem. We think spin is going to play a part so we have Lyon in."Australia have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "The pitch today is exactly the same that was used for the South Africa game. Prosper Utseya got a hat-trick on this one. There is hard clay. It is very dry, cracks will come in to play. It is starting to crumble just a touch. It is going to spin all the way through", reckons Shaun Pollock.Australia have an easy chance to secure a win here today before they face South Africa a couple of days later. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe would want to put things right by batting responsibly. Can the hosts turn things around? Or will they break down under strain once again? Hello and welcome to the fourth ODI of the Triangular series. Toss and teams coming up in a few minutes. Stay tuned...Australia, on the other hand, look strong. Although they suffered at the hands of the South African batsmen in their previous match, they will not be much worried against the hosts. They will be boosted today with the return of Michael Clarke. After being sidelined with an injury for six months, Clarke would like to utilize this game to ease back at the international level.Zimbabwe will lock horns with Australia today for the second time in the series. After getting thrashed by 198 runs in their first game, the hosts face a difficult task of securing their maiden win in the tournament. Two days ago, they had South Africa in a spot of bother with a sensational display of spin bowling. However, the pressure got to their batsmen, as they succumbed to a 61-run defeat. If they have to get out of this mess, they will need to play as a team instead of meekly surrendering while batting.Preview by Bharath RamarajZimbabwe, who have lost all their games till now have an uphill task on their hands when they face up to the mighty Australian unit for the second time in the tournament. Zimbabwe had a chance to upset the apple-cart and defeat South Africa in their last game. However, the batsmen flopped miserably under pressure and Zimbabwe lost by 61 runs.ZimbabweIn their last game, Zimbabwe, bowled with discipline and purpose. In particular, the spinners led by Prosper Utseya took advantage of a track that assisted slow bowlers to keep the opposition in check. They need a similar effort from their slow bowlers in their match against Australia. It has to be also remembered that Australian openers, Aaron Finch and Phil Hughes like pace on the ball.Elton Chigumbura, the captain of Zimbabwe can perhaps go for the jugular and try a spinner early in the innings. It would also be interesting to see whether Zimbabwe can pick a leg-spinner especially, Timycen Maruma, as Glen Maxwell struggles to pick the wrong un. Maruma has a decent googly up his sleeve.It has to be said though, for Zimbabwe to give Australia a run for their money, they need their batsmen to come good. Most of the batsmen are in decent form, but in ODIs, it is imperative that the top-order batsmen erect tall scores. Hamilton Masakadza, Sikandar Raza and company played sparkling shots against South Africa, but got out to soft dismissals. Even Sean Williams, known for playing with a calm head on his shoulders, lost his wicket to a soft dismissal. Brendan Taylor, Zimbabwe's best batsman has been struggling for form and that isn't helping their cause either. At present, his confidence seems to have been shot to pieces.AustraliaAustralia would be smarting from their defeat in their last game against South Africa. Despite their batsmen putting up a mammoth total on the board, South African batsmen put up a rip-roaring performance to chase down the target.One glaring weakness that could be seen in the Australian bowling line-up was they lacked a slow bowler. Australia need to pick Nathan Lyon for the match against Zimbabwe. On good batting tracks, it is always better to have a spinner to stem the run flow in the middle overs.Australia though, would be buoyed by the fact that Michael Clarke is likely to play in the game against Zimbabwe. He is an experienced campaigner and a fine captain too. Finch, Hughes and Maxwell like pace on the ball and hit through the line. George Bailey and Clarke can bring that solidarity to the line-up, as they milk the spinners well.One more factor, Australia have to improve is their fielding. They surprisingly dropped chances in the match against South Africa and that cost them dear.Ground conditionsAlready three matches have been played at the Harare Sports Club. So, unless they are using a different track for tomorrow's game, the slow bowlers should come into play. It was certainly the case when South Africa played Zimbabwe, as the spinners ruled the roost. If it is a used up track, then the captain who wins the toss may elect to bat first.QuotesBatting-wise I'm completely fine, I feel it (the pain) a little bit (while) batting but not much at all so it doesn't restrict me. The hardest thing has been running, so it's a real positive sign that I've been able to get through today: Michael Clarke.Teams:Australia (From): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Mitchell Marsh, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, Nathan Lyon, Ben Cutting, Michael ClarkeZimbabwe (From): Tino Mawoyo, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w), Sean Williams, Malcolm Waller, Elton Chigumbura(c), Prosper Utseya, John Nyumbu, Tendai Chatara, Brian Vitori, Luke Jongwe, Shingirai Masakadza, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Vusi Sibanda, Timycen Maruma, Natsai Mushangwe, Curthbert Musoko, Neville MadzivaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
