The players are making their way out to the middle.Zimbabwe will be happy with the way they pulled things back during the the last 20 overs, but it's not going to be an easy run-chase either. Will the Afghans become the first-ever Associate nation to beat a full-member in a 5-match series? Or will Zimbabwe make it 3-2 in their favour? Only time will tell. Join us back in some time for the run-chaseBoth of them registered fifties but got out soon after. Skipper Stanikzai too held one end up when he was batting but apart from the top four, the middle order failed to put up a decent partnership. If not for Mirwais Ashraf, who made a 16-ball 21 towards the end, Afghanistan would have faltered much before. Masakadza and Raza both picked up three wickets for the hosts.At 160/2 in the 34th over, Afghanistan were in the driver's seat but they lost momentum as they kept losing wickets after that. To be precise, Afghanistan lost 7 wickets for 80 runs and it was their middle-order which failed to get going once again. After Shahzad and Noor Ali Zadran got Afghanistan off to a flier, it was the 97-run second wicket partnership between Noor Ali and Nabi that put the visitors in pole position.4
