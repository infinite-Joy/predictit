One they would have taken at the toss I would assume. A good old-fashioned innings. Steady start, consolidation in the middle and a blockbuster end. Made possible by a well planned 73 from Craig Ervine which glued it all together. It was Moor though who provided the initial impetus right at the top of the order with almost a run-a-ball half-century. Couldn't quite kick on after that as the Afghani spinners began taking stock. That's where Ervine's innings came in handy as he milked the singles and twos to keep things rolling. And who doesn't like a lower order dash, coming out all swinging! We'll be back in around half an hour to see if Afghanistan are game enough.4

Hello and welcome to the 2nd game of the 5-match ODI series between Afghanistan and Zimbabwe. Afghanistan defended a paltry 131 in the previous game to break into the top 10 of the ICC ODI rankings for the first time.

They know that they have it in them and all they need to do is play as a team to get out of this predicament. This might be deemed as a battle between minnows but it won't be devoid of action. Stay tuned for the toss and team update.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Peter Moor, Chamu Chibhabha, Craig Ervine, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Elton Chigumbura(c), Sikandar Raza, Malcolm Waller, Luke Jongwe, Graeme Cremer, Wellington Masakadza, Taurai Muzarabani, Tendai Chisoro, Neville Madziva, Tinashe Panyangara, Hamilton MasakadzaAfghanistan (From): Noor Ali Zadran, Mohammad Shahzad(w), Mohammad Nabi, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai(c), Samiullah Shenwari, Najibullah Zadran, Mirwais Ashraf, Dawlat Zadran, Amir Hamza, Yamin Ahmadzai, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Rashid Khan, Shafiqullah Shafiq, Gulbadin Naib, Karim Sadiq, Rahmat Shah, Rokhan Barakzai, Sayed Shirzad, Usman Ghani, Nawaz KhanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
