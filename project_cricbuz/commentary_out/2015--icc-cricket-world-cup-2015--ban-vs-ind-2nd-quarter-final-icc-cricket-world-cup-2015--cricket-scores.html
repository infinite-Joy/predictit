He was so late on the pull shot and the ball flew straight up in the air after taking a top edge, Dhoni called for it, just moved a few steps to his right and swallowed it easily. In fact, Rahim was in no position to play the pull shot. India are inching closer to a big victory! Rahim c Dhoni b U Yadav 27(43) [4s-2]U Yadav to Rahim, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Time for the batting powerplay.The drinks trolley arrives on the field. India are well on top. The spinners have tied one end up and the Bangladeshi batsmen have struggled to rotate the strike on a consistent basis. With the asking rate almost touching 11, it would need something heroic from these two for Bangladesh to win the game. Otherwise, India are on course to book a semi-final spot.

BANGLADESH:16.6 Shami to Mahmudullah, out Caught by Dhawan!! Big wicket for India. The in-form Mahmudullah makes the long walk back to the pavilion after Ian Gould raises his finger. Once again the Indian quickies have used the short ball to good effect. Mahmudullah was hurried on the pull, top-edges it to fine leg, Dhawan initially ran too far forward, but tracked back, tried to take it over his head, but the ball popped out as he was losing balance, he did well to flick it up, go out of the rope and come back in to complete the catch. He was quite confident that he had taken it cleanly and the replays confirmed that. Mahmudullah c Dhawan b Shami 21(31) [4s-2]Shami to Mahmudullah, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Dhawan is claiming a catch. Mahmudullah is the batsman. Dhawan is confident as he signals out after holding on. It has been sent upstairs. Shami's front foot is fine. Was he touching the rope? It is a very close call.

BANGLADESH:16.1 Shami to Mahmudullah, 1 run, short and on the body, Mahmudullah stays inside the line and helps it down to fine leg with a pullMohammed Shami [2.0-0-17-0] is back into the attackMS Dhoni then introduced the reliable Mohit Sharma into the attack. Just in the nick of time, Umesh Yadav produced the edge to dismiss Tamim and a terrible mix-up between Imrul Kayes and Soumya Sarkar saw Kayes finding himself short of the crease and he was run out. Ravichandran Ashwin bowled a tight over to put Bangladesh's batsmen under more pressure. Ashwin has used the drifter to good effect in this World Cup. Before the doosra came into play, off-spinners like Hugh Tayfield, Erapalli Prasanna, Lance Gibbs, Fred Titmus and Co. used it extensively to take wickets. While chasing down a massive target, it is imperative for the top-order to fire. Unfortunately for Bangladesh, they have lost a couple of wickets. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis for the first 16 overs: Runs flowed smoothly from Tamim Iqbal's bat as Bangladesh made a fine start. Tamim gave a glimpse of his ability to find gaps through the off-side by cracking three sparkling boundaries off Mohammed Shami's bowling. Shami didn't help his cause by generally bowling short and wide. It is interesting to note that the outfield at the MCG is lightning quick. It wasn't the case before.Drinks are on the field now

Raina asked Dhoni, but he just ran forward and took his position for the next over. Raina asked Kayes, who cheekily nodded yes with a smile on his face. Cheeky from both Raina and Kayes. Raina for asking and full marks to Kayes for nodding yes, he may have been just rubbing it in as the Indians didn't go for the review. Either ways it's done and let's move on

Tamim is on strike. U Yadav will open the attackRight.. we are back. Umesh has the new ball with him. Two slips in placeHad a second glance at the Mortaza-Taskin conversation. Taskin started to explain to his captain, but was quickly shot down by Mortaza. Taskin then went quiet. As Mortaza seemed to be getting out of hand, a couple of Bangladeshis quickly came across and defused the situation. As I type this, the Indians are on the field and in a huddle. We should be ready to restart. Remember since rain played a part and Bangladesh didn't bowl their overs on time, the innings break was just for a 30-minute duration.Rohit: "It was important, big game - quarterfinal, wanted to make it count and I am glad that eventually we posted a good total. We need to come back now and bowl well. It was important for me to stay, especially knowing that we lost a couple of wickets in the middle. Before we started we knew it was going to be slow and low. We wanted to take our time, especially I wanted to take time, that's how I play my game. I knew if I stay there till 30-35th over I could make it and that's what I did, wanted to stay till the end. All the shots I played, I liked it. After the rain, I think the ball was coming on nicely. It was important to just hold the shape and play your shots and that's what exactly I did. I think so it's a decent total. We know the Bangladeshi batsmen. We can't underestimate them. They have posted 290s and 300s in the league games. We have to come and bowl really well. Fielding will be very important. We have to be very energetic on the field. Take some catches, run-outs and stuff like that. Hopefully, we can come and defend the target."We have the man of the moment, Rohit Sharma's interview transcribed word-to-word:And I had previously mentioned that I will keep an eye on Mortaza's reactions on the field. After Taskin bowled Rohit, Mortaza was right in the youngster's face. The captain instead of congratulating the bowler for the wicket, was angrily gesturing and asking him why he didn't execute the yorker earlier in the over. He was unhappy with the two short balls that went for boundaries. Mortaza's reaction was very aggressive and there were some cuss words spoken as well. Poor, Taskin just bore the brunt of his captain's reaction and sportingly shrugged his shoulders. Taskin finished off with a smile, without even saying a word. Extreme from Mortaza, but shows the passion and commitment he plays the game. Depends on which way you want to take it, I suppose.The target should prove to be difficult for Bangladesh as it is not easy to bat under lights at the MCG. Remember, no side has scored 300 while batting second at the MCG in ODIs. However, one expects them to put up a spirited performance and give their fancied opponents a run for their money.With Shakib and Rubel keeping the opposition in check, Ajinkya Rahane had a rare moment of indiscretion as he looked to play on the up and Taskin picked up a wicket. At that time, Bangladesh seemed to have gained the upper hand, but Raina and Rohit came to India's rescue. Bangladesh didn't help their cause by allowing both the batsmen to take easy singles. The story could have been different for them, as Rohit was caught in the deep off Rubel's bowling, but the on-field umpire, Aleem Dar, adjudged a full toss that was clearly below the waist as a no ball for height.Earlier, after Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit stitched a useful partnership for the first wicket, Bangladesh's bowlers bowled with diligence and discipline to pull the batting side back. After Shakib provided the crucial breakthrough by taking the wicket of Dhawan, it was Rubel, who bowled an inspired spell and was rewarded for his efforts with the wicket of Virat Kohli. Rubel preyed on Kohli's inclination to poke at deliveries on a fourth or fifth stump line and it bore fruit as he produced the edge to send Kohli back to the pavilion. Rubel also surprised Kohli with the odd bouncer. Rohit started on a great note by essaying fine drives, imperious pull shots and lofted strokes. However, as India lost a slew of wickets in the middle overs, he looked to play the anchor role before opening up his shoulders in the slog overs. He showed his class by using soft hands to steer Taskin Ahmed through the third-man region for a boundary in the 39th over. He also played a sweetly timed shot down the ground to thump Rubel Hossain for a six and collect 15 runs in the 46th over. One has to give credit to Suresh Raina as well as it was Raina's offensive that helped India to up the tempo. He launched Shakib Al Hasan over the long-on region for a stunning six and smacked a low full toss from Rubel for a boundary to give the innings the much needed impetus. Rohit Sharma played with unruffled elegance to compose a memorable ton and take India to a massive total on the board. In fact, Bangladesh came across as a highly-motivated side and put India under immense pressure by picking up wickets at regular intervals, but it was Rohit, who steered them to safe waters. For most part of his innings, Rohit looked in sublime touch and picked the length very early. Rohit's feet, his bat and body seemed to be instinctively aligned, as he waited for the ball to arrive and for him to find the gaps in the field with his graceful game.Here is something that interested me. Rohit becomes the second Indian after Sourav Ganguly to score a WC hundred in a knockout game. That is an unbelievable stat. I cannot fathom the fact that only one Indian has scored a hundred before today. And India have won two World Cups! Ganguly got his hundred against Kenya in the 2003 WC semi-final. The likes of Sachin, Azhar, Dravid, Sehwag and Co. haven't got a hundred in a knockout game. That's staggering stuff.4
INDIA:49.6 Rubel to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, well bowled Rubel! Yorker on off, dug out to cover, only a single results and India end on 302. Just the 6 singles came off the final over. Excellent one from Rubel under the circumstances
INDIA:49.5 Rubel to Ashwin, 1 run, very full and on the stumps, Ashwin's bat turns and he gets a single to long-on. Rubel hasn't given the batters anything to get under
INDIA:49.4 Rubel to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, low full toss, clipped to mid-wicket. 300 is up for India. Mild cheer goes up at the 'G'. Rubel has done well so far in this over
INDIA:49.3 Rubel to Ashwin, 1 run, Rubel is doing a good job. In the blockhole, Ashwin deep in the crease and wristing it to mid-on. Again just a single
INDIA:49.2 Rubel to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, very full and on off, no timing on the big hit, single to extra cover
INDIA:49.1 Rubel to Ashwin, 1 run, Mortaza applauds that effort from Taskin. That's good to see. The youngster has just finished his spell and he cannot run and take the catch at third man. It was ramped by Ashwin and a quicker fielder would've got there, the ball bounces in front of Taskin as he stumbles and slips while running forward. They are happy with just a singleRavichandran Ashwin, right handed bat, comes to the creaseRubel Hossain [9.0-0-50-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:48.6 Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, out Caught by Nasir Hossain!! Nasir keeps his head as others are losing theirs in the field. Short and cramping Dhoni for room, he swivelled for a big pull, the ball went off the thick outside half, more of a slice and point running back takes it well. Kept his eyes on the ball and took it comfortably. Dhoni c Nasir Hossain b Taskin Ahmed 6(11)Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:48.5 Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, 2 runs, very full and on the stumps, Dhoni went for a big hoick, but it ran off the inside half, maybe he was looking for the helicopter as well, he was deep in the crease and he gets two to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:48.4 Taskin Ahmed to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, slower delivery from Taskin Ahmed, heaved away to deep mid-wicket, Kayes this time has an easier job and keeps it to a single
INDIA:48.3 Taskin Ahmed to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, Imrul Kayes, better win it for Bangaldesh with the bat. That won't make Mortaza happy. It will make him mad. Already Mortaza is seething with rage. It was a simple slide and stop, but Kayes after getting across to his right from deep mid-wicket, allowed the ball to slip under his body. Got the slide right, but incomprehensibly allowed the ball to escape. Retrieves the ball and throws it back. The camera pans to Mortaza, but I didn't pick up anything from him
INDIA:48.2 Taskin Ahmed to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, Ravindra Jadeja now gets four. Taskin Ahmed did well to follow the batsman, who was backing away, but bowled it full, which was the mistake, allowed Jadeja to clip it wide of backward square leg, inside the ring, beats deep square leg running to his left. Taskin Ahmed wears a disappointed look as he walks back
INDIA:48.1 Taskin Ahmed to Ravindra Jadeja, 2 runs, Taskin Ahmed shakes his head and the Bangladeshi fielding has gone to pieces. Chipped in front of mid-off, the fielder didn't need to shy as Ravindra Jadeja was well in, does so and ends up giving away an extra run, as there was no-one backing up. Very poor from Bangladesh
INDIA:47.6 Shakib to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, yorker length outside off, jammed out to long-off
INDIA:47.5 Shakib to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, that is thumped by Ravindra Jadeja. Down the track and he belts the length ball wide of the diving cover, no chance for long-off, running across. The fielder at cover could've done a much better job at the edge of the circle
INDIA:47.4 Shakib to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, Shakib has beaten Ravindra Jadeja, but the batsman has got a boundary. Jadeja was looking to come down the track, it was fraction short, so he went back and edged the cut, deflected off Rahim's pad and raced away past the short third inside the ring. Shakib has a wry smile on his face
INDIA:47.3 Shakib to Dhoni, 1 run, yorker length outside off, Dhoni took two steps forward and his ugly hack across the line, sees him get a thick inside half to long-on
INDIA:47.2 Shakib to Dhoni, no run, again well bowled Shakib. Sees Dhoni charging and drags the length back, Dhoni has to adjust and hits it straight back at Shakib
INDIA:47.1 Shakib to Dhoni, no run, slower and well bowled by Shakib, Dhoni has to adjust and pushes it softly to coverShakib Al Hasan [9.0-0-48-1] is back into the attackRavindra Jadeja, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:46.6 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, out Bowled!! Taskin Ahmed finally gets some solace. He gets Rohit. In the blockhole, Rohit was trying to jam it out, with an angled bat, Rohit jammed it out, but the ball hit the turf and then the stumps. Taskin Ahmed does a Akhtar as he unveils his aeroplane celebration with both arms stretched out wide. Rohit b Taskin Ahmed 137(126) [4s-14 6s-3]Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:46.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, makes room to go over cover, but hits it uppishly, mistimed and it falls in front of Shakib at cover, who got his body behind the ball and stopped it. Rohit sends Dhoni back
INDIA:46.4 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit is just toying with a young Taskin Ahmed. He is reading him like a book. Anticipates that the bowler may bowl the slower delivery, shuffles across and then picks the back-of-the-hand slower delivery, it sits up short for him to pull over square leg, no-one there and it dribbles away. Taskin Ahmed under huge pressure now
INDIA:46.3 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, SIX, how well is Rohit hitting them? Very well. Just a forward press and then slams it across the line over wide long-on, caught in the crowd by a young Sardar. Taskin Ahmed guilty of bowling too short and Rohit was waiting for it. The bat may have turned on impact, but enough timing on the shot to clear the long boundary
INDIA:46.3 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, wide, banged in very short and Rohit leaves. Wide called for height and the right call too as it was way over the head
INDIA:46.2 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, Rohit missed out there, slower delivery outside off, width outside off, short too, Rohit cuts and picks out point
INDIA:46.1 Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, 1 run, short and hurried onto Dhoni, who mistimes the pull to deep mid-wicket, wants two, but Rohit sends him back
INDIA:45.6 Rubel to Rohit, FOUR, 'save your legs Rohit Sharma, don't run' says Nasser on air! So effortlessly played and perfect description from Nasser. It was on a good length and outside off, may have been the slower delivery as well, Rohit just lazily punched it wide of cover and split mid-off too. Both were inside the ring and Rohit continues to churn out boundaries
INDIA:45.5 Rubel to Dhoni, 1 run, short and down leg, Dhoni swivel-pulls, but finds fine leg, single taken
INDIA:45.4 Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, slower delivery outside off, Rohit calmly knocks it wide of point, takes the single on offer
INDIA:45.3 Rubel to Rohit, FOUR, now pulls through mid-wicket. Knew Rubel will bowl short after getting hit for a six and murders a short-arm pull, sat back and hammered it
INDIA:45.2 Rubel to Rohit, SIX, fabulous shot! Rubel misses his length and Rohit hits the bowler for a six over long-off. Rubel failed to find the yorker, Rohit went deep in his crease and lofted it beautifully over long-off. Sweet timing and it went all the way. Dhoni walks up to him and punches gloves
INDIA:45.1 Rubel to Rohit, no run, Rubel starts off well, right up there, Rohit drills it straight to the fielder at mid-off, inside the ringRubel Hossain [8.0-0-34-1] is back into the attackLots of hand waving was going on just before Taskin Ahmed bowled that final delivery of the over. There were too many people in the Bangladeshi team trying to set the field. That confused the bowler, but he held his nerve to finish the over with a dot
INDIA:44.6 Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, no run, dug in short outside off, Dhoni reaches out and tries to upper cut, but can't connect
INDIA:44.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 1 run, slower, shortish delivery outside off, Rohit delays the cut and hits it to the right of short third, Dhoni told Rohit in Hindi - 'aa jaa, aa jaa' and Rohit makes it to the other end without any trouble at all
INDIA:44.4 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 2 runs, Dhoni is so quick. He races across for the second, the call was two right from the moment Rohit pulled it, wide of deep mid-wicket, the fielder did a good job but couldn't beat Dhoni. Two taken with ease in the end
INDIA:44.3 Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, 1 run, full and on the pads, clipped to deep square leg, only a single
INDIA:44.2 Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, no run, width outside off, Dhoni went too hard on the cut and bottom-edged it back to Taskin Ahmed's left. Fielded by the bowler. Those two dots should help Bangaldesh
INDIA:44.1 Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, no run, short of length on the pads, turned to short mid-wicketTaskin Ahmed [7.0-0-40-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:43.6 Mortaza to Rohit, FOUR, more class from Rohit. Just a back foot punch and he gets four. Past the diving cover to his left, once it beat the fielder inside the ring, had to beat long-off to his left as well, the distance that the fielder had to cover made it hard and the ball trickled into the ad-cushions. Didn't hit it hard, just timed it superbly and the outfield did the restMS Dhoni, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:43.5 Mortaza to Raina, out Caught by Rahim!! Raina goes. Top-edged straight up in the air and a good catch by Rahim, slower off-cutter on the stumps, Raina looked for the big slog and got a heavy edge. Not easy to grab swirlers like that, but Rahim kept his cool and went back, got those big gloves around the ball and grabbed it. There were insects and debris flying around, but he didn't allow that to distract him. Raina c Rahim b Mortaza 65(57) [4s-7 6s-1]Mortaza to Raina, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:43.4 Mortaza to Raina, no run, on a length and outside off, Raina wants to go over cover, but mistimes it to the right of the bowler. That came off the bottom of the bat. Mortaza fields
INDIA:43.3 Mortaza to Raina, 2 runs, just short of long-on charging forward. Raina uses his feet and mishits, but gets away as the ball didn't carry. The fielder didn't put in the dive, instead offered his body and it ricocheted away. They take two
INDIA:43.2 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, that will make Mortaza unhappy. And angry even more. Sarkar with the fumble after Rohit punched that towards mid-off, Sarkar got across and Rohit had said no for the single. But the fumble allows the single, what's more he throws to the wrong end, when a throw to the keeper could've produced something for Raina was running blind
INDIA:43.1 Mortaza to Raina, 1 run, slower delivery on leg stump, Raina makes room, but Mortaza follows him, clipped to deep square leg
INDIA:42.6 Shakib to Raina, 1 run, Raina comes down the track and takes it on the full, clipped to long-on. Good over from Shakib, just the four off it
INDIA:42.5 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit makes room and drives hard and straight to deep cover, only a single
INDIA:42.4 Shakib to Raina, 1 run, pre-meditates the paddle, but Shakib bowls a low full toss, Raina early into the shot and off the toe-end of the bat and down to long-on
INDIA:42.3 Shakib to Raina, no run, Raina gets inside the line and goes for a big hoick, but misses, no appeal from the Bangladeshis, but it would've been sliding down
INDIA:42.2 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, tossed up on the stumps, driven hard and straight to long-off
INDIA:42.1 Shakib to Rohit, no run, Shakib beats Rohit with a ball that turns away a little, the turn beats the outside edge as Rohit went for the drive, Rahim whipped the bails off, but Rohit had gone nowhere, not even referred to the third umpire
INDIA:41.6 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, calmly knocks the ball to long-on and retains the strike with that run
INDIA:41.6 Mortaza to Rohit, no ball, 2 runs, there it is! Punches it through cover and gets there. Takes two and then after finishing the second, he leaps and punches the air. Removes the helmet, raises his bat to all corners of the 'G'. Takes in all the applause from the Indians. What is worse is that Mortaza only had four inside the circle. Basic error that and it's a no-ball. Well spotted by Gould. The fielder at sweeper charged at the ball and misfielded. The Indian contingent were on their feet as soon as Rohit reached his 100. Well played, in a pressure gameRohit gets his 100! He is punching the air in delightRohit is on 99. Crowd know that and cheer. What is the field that Mortaza has? Four inside the circle all on the off-side.
INDIA:41.5 Mortaza to Raina, 1 run, Raina makes room and looks for the big hit, but Mortaza slips in a slower delivery, pushed past the bowler's left
INDIA:41.4 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit is willing to be patient. He defends this in front of cover and sets off. Raina responds in kind and makes it easily
INDIA:41.3 Mortaza to Raina, 1 run, on a good length and on the pads, nudged through mid-wicket for a single, brings Rohit on strike
INDIA:41.2 Mortaza to Raina, FOUR, class from Raina. Shuffles across a bit and then goes over backward square leg in the ring. Controlled flick, even though it was in the air, no-one in the deep at deep square leg and Raina will get a boundaryMortaza is again not happy with his fielders. He was moving one of them and didn't like that the fielder wasn't in the exact position he wanted him to be. Waves his hand angrily
INDIA:41.1 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, short and wide outside off, cut square of the wicket, just a singleMashrafe Mortaza [8.0-0-49-0] is back into the attackForgot to add that India scored 50 in the batting powerplay
INDIA:40.6 Shakib to Raina, FOUR, rubbish ball and Raina puts Shakib away. Down leg and short, Raina had all the time to rock back and choose his spot, he did so, sending the ball to the deep fine leg fence, over the man inside the ring at short fine. Shakib grimaces at the end of the over
INDIA:40.5 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, gets forward and softly pushes the tossed up delivery outside off into the gap at cover, for a single
INDIA:40.4 Shakib to Rohit, FOUR, now all the luck is with Rohit and India. A thick outside edge runs through the vacant slip and beats short third, fraction short outside off, Rohit cuts and gets lucky. Just a hit away now to get to his hundred
INDIA:40.3 Shakib to Raina, 1 run, short and pulled straight to the fielder at deep backward square leg, fifty for Raina and he raises his bat to all corners of the ground. Another nice innings from the left-hander
INDIA:40.2 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit gets forward and eases a single to long-onMy apologies to Gould. It was Aleem Dar who signalled no-ball from square leg. He had the hand up straightaway and that prompted Gould to signal no-ball. Dar seems to have lost all his confidence in recent times. Did the wasp bite have something to do with it? He could've waited a bit longer and then referred it upstairs, if he wasn't sure. Anyway let's move on
INDIA:40.1 Shakib to Raina, 1 run, sliding on, nudged to backward square leg, for a singleShakib Al Hasan [7.0-0-32-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:39.6 Rubel to Raina, 1 run, good length on the stumps, tucked to mid-wicket, retains the strike with that run
INDIA:39.5 Rubel to Raina, FOUR, Raina rubs more salt into the wound. This was overpitched outside off and Raina leant forward to drive wide of mid-off, got it in the gap and the quick outfield does the rest
INDIA:39.4 Rubel to Raina, 2 runs, short outside off, Raina pulls and top-edges it, mid-on running back cannot get back in time and catch it. Shakib didn't dive, he just watched the ball lob over him. Raina now gets away. No luck for Rubel
INDIA:39.4 Rubel to Rohit, no ball, 1 run, caught and it's a no-ball! That is a shocking decision from Ian Gould. Well below the waist. Gould has got that wrong. Roar from the Indians in the crowd. They saw the hand stretched from Gould and went ballistic. Rubel is a disappointed man. He takes a deep breath at the top of his mark. Low full toss, swung straight to the fielder at deep square leg, Rohit lost his shape and one hand came off the bat handle as he swung. Luckily he gets away with one. Bangladesh don't have a review left too, to challenge that call. Could still prove to be a big moment, and a turning point come the end of the game
INDIA:39.3 Rubel to Rohit, no run, back of a length outside off, Rohit opens the face of the bat and guides it to the left of point, who dives and fields. Good stop
INDIA:39.2 Rubel to Raina, 1 run, short of length outside off, Raina punches it to the left of mid-off for another single
INDIA:39.1 Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Rohit gets forward and drives to the left of mid-off, moves into the nineties

INDIA:38.5 Taskin Ahmed to Raina, 1 run, on the pads, nudged to the right of short fine running across
INDIA:38.4 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 1 run, short of length outside off, Rohit opens the face of the bat and runs it down to third manNow a slip is brought in
INDIA:38.3 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, well played by Rohit. It bounced from a back of a length and straightened too, Rohit adjusted well and didn't jab at it, controlled stroke through vacant slip, beats third man and leaves Taskin Ahmed disappointed
INDIA:38.2 Taskin Ahmed to Raina, 1 run, on the pads, worked away to deep backward square leg, for a singleThe players are back on the field. The Bangladeshis are stretching and doing a bit of warming up. Taskin and Mortaza have a chat. And there come the batsmen. They are slowly walking in. Ian Gould has to go back inside and call them in. Mortaza looks unhappy with that. Tardy from Raina and Rohit. They should've been there along with the Bangladeshis. Team director, Ravi Shastri looks a bit nervy. He is twiddling his thumbs. As soon as he sees the camera is on him, he puts on a more cool face.Nice to see a Bangladeshi player walk up to Raina and check on him while he was walking back. Raina was gesturing that everything was fine. Harsha had this to say when he saw the physio on air: 'The physio can stay there, the patient is coming to him.'17:31 Local Time, 06:31 GMT, 12:01 IST: The lights are on at the 'G' and the clouds are passing. As I type this, the umpires are back out there and the news is that they are restarting in four minutes time. A cheer goes up on the ground after the umpires are seen on the ground. 'They should've listened to you Warnie' says Harsha on air.What has happened here? Raina isn't happy. He is grimacing. Hoho! It has started to rain as well. Shane Warne reckons it will be a five-ten minute stop. Doesn't think it will rain for a long time. The physio was waiting to come in and check on Raina, but he was stopped by the rain. The batsmen are walking back and the square has been covered now.
INDIA:38.1 Taskin Ahmed to Raina, 2 runs, Raina patted that with soft hands in front of long-on and wide of deep mid-wicket. Two was the call and they complete two easily. Rohit was the one running to the danger end and he made it in timeTaskin Ahmed [6.0-0-30-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:37.6 Rubel to Raina, 1 run, Raina went for a big hoick over mid-wicket, but failed to time it properly, gets a single though to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:37.5 Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, short outside off, Rohit slashes and gets it wide of backward point, a single to square third manBangladesh seem to have lost the plot after the second drinks break. They are leaking runs, the fielding has been sloppy. The body language too isn't good as fingers are being pointed in all directions
INDIA:37.4 Rubel to Raina, 1 run, turns the strike over with a nudge to short mid-wicket
INDIA:37.3 Rubel to Raina, FOUR, gift for Raina and he won't miss out. Low full toss down leg, it needed bat and Raina provided that with a clip, beating short fine inside the ring. Lots of hand-waving going on at the moment from the Bangladeshis
INDIA:37.2 Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Rohit gets forward to drive to mid-off, Shakib is standing at the edge of the circle and it's an easy single
INDIA:37.1 Rubel to Raina, 1 run, full and on the stumps, Raina went for a big drive and inside-edged it through backward square leg, there were thoughts of a second, but that was sniffed out quickly by the fielder running acrossRubel Hossain [6.0-0-14-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:36.6 Shakib to Rohit, FOUR, calculated hit and Rohit gets a boundary. Knows that he has to get it over the men inside behind square and opts for the sweep, kneels down and hits it well, that will be 11 runs off the over. India getting a move on now
INDIA:36.5 Shakib to Rohit, no run, pushed back to the bowler as Rohit lunged forward to meet the ball

INDIA:36.2 Shakib to Raina, no run, softly taps it beside his feet as Shakib slows it up
INDIA:36.1 Shakib to Raina, SIX, Raina goes over long-on. On the boundary. Comes down the track and lofts Shakib all the way. The fielder is there with the Indians in the crowd behind him, but he watched it sail over his head. Once again Raina targetting the bowler off the first delivery of the over. Connected well and had to as it was a big boundaryShakib Al Hasan [6.0-0-21-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:35.6 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, on the pads, clipped to square leg, didn't hit the gap thereRohit is having a look at the field as Mortaza takes his time to bowl this final delivery
INDIA:35.5 Mortaza to Raina, 1 run, another cutter from Mortaza, that stopped on Raina who adjusts and dabs it with soft hands, in front of short third
INDIA:35.4 Mortaza to Raina, no run, short of length on the pads, whipped straight to the fielder at backward square leg
INDIA:35.3 Mortaza to Raina, FOUR, Mortaza is a frustrated man. He wants to know how that has gone to the boundary. He stretches his arms wide and wants an answer. It was a slower delivery outside off, Raina opens the face of the bat and splits backward point and short third, right in the gap as the former dived across, while the latter ran after the ball, but couldn't stop it. The quick outfield takes it all the way. The fielders are on the ground and don't want to look at Mortaza
INDIA:35.2 Mortaza to Raina, no run, slower delivery from Mortaza, defended to the left of Mortaza
INDIA:35.1 Mortaza to Raina, FOUR, lovely way to begin the powerplay. Raina shimmies down the wicket and goes for his favorite inside-out shot over cover, everyone are in on the off-side and Raina knew that. Beautifully played and deliberately hit over the infield. The Indian dug-out applaud that shotBatting powerplay time!
INDIA:34.6 Nasir Hossain to Raina, 1 run, tossed up outside off and Raina gets forward to drive to long-off
INDIA:34.5 Nasir Hossain to Raina, no run, down leg, Raina can't glance it away, Rohit doesn't want the leg bye as Rahim moves quickly to his right

INDIA:33.6 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, on a good length and outside off, Rohit dabs straight to the fielder at point
INDIA:33.5 Mortaza to Rohit, FOUR, delicate stuff from Rohit. There was no width on that at all from Mortaza, but he opens the face of the bat and plays a cute tap to the right of the diving Rahim, played ever so late and that's a boundary of the highest class
INDIA:33.4 Mortaza to Raina, 1 run, Raina opens the face of the bat and angles the bat to run it down to third man
INDIA:33.3 Mortaza to Raina, no run, now Mortaza beats Raina on the drive, full and outside off, Raina went for a big drive and missed. Carries nicely to Rahim
INDIA:33.2 Mortaza to Raina, no run, that pitched just a millimetre outside leg and that saves Raina who had shuffled way too across and got struck right in front. The bat came around the front pad and the ball pinged the pad. Gould if he has given it for pitching outside leg, then fab decision for him. The decision left the Bangladeshis and Mortaza stunned. Disappointment shown tooMortaza goes up for a review against Raina. For a lbw. Raina shuffled across a long way and missed. Gould didn't give it out. No bat. 'Definitely no bat involved in that, bat seems to have hit pad,' says the third umpire. 'Pitching outside leg, so you can stay with your original decision Ian, I will let you know when the camera is on you. You are on camera now and you can make the signal now,' signs off the third umpire. So Raina will survive. Loud roar from the Indians in the crowd. Just a millimetre outside leg. Mortaza can't believe it. As do the Bangladeshis in the crowd. So close!
INDIA:33.1 Mortaza to Raina, no run, good length on middle and leg, turned to short mid-wicket
INDIA:32.6 Nasir Hossain to Raina, 1 run, that was just a defensive stroke, but it races past Nasir Hossain's right and beats his dive

INDIA:31.3 Mortaza to Raina, leg byes, 1 run, Raina shuffles across and misses the leg-side clip, off the pad and Rahim diving to his right, can't stop it cleanly
INDIA:31.2 Mortaza to Rohit, 3 runs, sloppy from Bangladesh. It was wristed to mid-on's right, it was always a single, the throw came to Rahim on the bounce, who failed to collect and there was no one backing up as well, they take two more. Mortaza isn't pleased
INDIA:31.1 Mortaza to Rohit, FOUR, very poor delivery from Mortaza, short and wide outside off, Rohit rocks back and cuts hard, over point, who leapt high to his right, but it was always going over his hand. Sweeper can't get there too. Good start after the break for India. That was a nothing ball and duly dispatchedMashrafe Mortaza [5.0-0-25-0] is back into the attackAt the other end, Shakib Al Hasan also bowled a few tight overs and was rewarded with the wicket of Shikhar Dhawan. To make it even better for Bangladesh, Taskin Ahmed sent Ajinkya Rahane back to the pavilion. It has been a superb comeback from them. For India, Rohit Sharma looked to hold the innings together and notched up a fine fifty.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis for the last 15 overs: Rubel Hossain bowled with fire and aggression to snare the key wicket of Virat Kohli. Kohli has a habit of playing away from the body and poking at deliveries bowled on a fourth or fifth stump line. Today too he paid the price for playing away from the body. However, the credit has to go to Rubel for pushing Kohli back and then pitching it up to produce the edge. Rubel is skiddy through the air and on a drop-in pitch, he is proving to be effective. Rubel has looked to attack the stumps and surprise the batsman with the odd bouncer. Interestingly, Rubel didn't bowl with the new ball. Maybe it was due to the fact that he doesn't like to bowl with the white new ball. Drinks again

INDIA:30.5 Nasir Hossain to Raina, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Raina pushes it to long-off

INDIA:29.6 Taskin Ahmed to Raina, FOUR, edged and through where a second slip would've been. Raina going hard on the cover drive and edging it. Played well away from the body and the angle across him made it difficult for him to control the stroke. Taskin Ahmed hides his face with his hand in disappointment
INDIA:29.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 1 run, slower delivery outside off, well outside off in fact and Rohit reaches out to squeeze it wide of the backward point fielderBackward point, point, cover and mid-off all in the ring for Rohit
INDIA:29.4 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, pitched up outside off, Rohit drills that well, but picks out mid-off, either side of the man and it would've been a boundaryRohit has done well to hang in there and grit a fifty out. He hasn't been in the greatest of nicks in the tournament, but in a knockout game, with his team under pressure, has got a start. India badly need him to kick on and if he does so, he has the capability to go big, once he is set. With Rahane too gone, it is imperative for Rohit to stay till the end and anchor India to a defendable total
INDIA:29.3 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, back of a length outside off, Rohit is on the hop and mistimes the cut, chopped to point
INDIA:29.2 Taskin Ahmed to Raina, 1 run, short and down leg, pulled straight to the fielder at fine leg, Raina swivelled on the shot and missed outA slip in place for the left-handed Raina
INDIA:29.1 Taskin Ahmed to Raina, no run, on a good length and outside off, Raina opens the face of the bat and defends to the right of pointComing back to the celebrations after the Rahane wicket, there was one chest-bump between Taskin and Mortaza, before Mortaza wanted a reprise of the act. That's when it got too exciting for the both of them and actually both fell to ground. Nothing serious though. No damage done too
INDIA:28.6 Nasir Hossain to Rohit, no run, Rohit shows the full face of the bat and drives it back to Nasir Hossain
INDIA:28.5 Nasir Hossain to Raina, 1 run, gets forward and looks to drive, off the inside edge and goes to deep backward square legDar is clearly troubled by that wasp bite. He goes up to Gould and shows him the back of his neck area. Stoppage in play as Dar seeks some medical attention. Will the reserve umpire come out? No. Dar is set to continue
INDIA:28.4 Nasir Hossain to Raina, byes, FOUR, Dar has made a mistake there. Down leg, Raina got a faint tickle on the leg-side glance and it hit the pad of Rahim before running away. Raina pointed out to Dar that he got bat on that, but Dar has more important things on his mind at the momentLooks like an insect has bitten Aleem Dar. Slight stoppage in play. He gets it checked from the bowler. Dar is grimacing and looks uncomfortable out there. For now he allows the bowler to bowl
INDIA:28.3 Nasir Hossain to Raina, no run, driven back to the bowler, that's three dots in a row
INDIA:28.2 Nasir Hossain to Raina, no run, down leg and swept straight to the fielder at short fine
INDIA:28.1 Nasir Hossain to Raina, no run, gets forward and pushes it to mid-on, no chance of a quick singleNasir Hossain [5.0-0-21-0] is back into the attackSuresh Raina, left handed bat, comes to the creaseLook at those celebrations from Taskin Ahmed and Mortaza. Taskin Ahmed couldn't contain his excitement after getting the wicket and ran up to his skipper to celebrate. There were a couple of chest-bumps between the two and off the second, Taskin Ahmed went to ground. Funny! But he has a smile on his face even as he goes to ground. That chest-bumping reminded me of the Leander Paes-Mahesh Bhupathi duo who perfected that for India
INDIA:27.6 Taskin Ahmed to Rahane, out Caught by Shakib!! Rahane has thrown it away. Wanted to go over mid-off, tried to play on-the-up and the bat face turned on impact, the ball lobs to the left of mid-off, where Shakib runs and then takes it, before tumbling over. Rahane never looked at ease today and the pressure got to him eventually. Bangladesh chip away. Rahane c Shakib b Taskin Ahmed 19(37) [4s-1]Taskin Ahmed to Rahane, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:27.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 1 run, shortish outside off, pulled to deep mid-wicket, Rohit controlled the shot and kept it down with a roll of the wrists

INDIA:27.2 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 1 run, short outside off, pulled to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:27.1 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, lovely flick. It was a tad too straight and on off and middle, Rohit played a delightful flick through mid-wicket, beat the chasing fielder easily, timing, balance and head position perfect on that shot. Breaks the shackles a bit with that boundary

INDIA:26.5 Shakib to Rahane, no run, nurdled to backward square leg

INDIA:26.1 Shakib to Rohit, no run, Rohit gets forward and pushes it to the right of Shakib who fields
INDIA:25.6 Taskin Ahmed to Rahane, FOUR, first boundary in 66 balls! And it has come via a thick outside edge. Taskin Ahmed had a slip stationed all over, but in order to protect the over, Mortaza moves the man and it has gone right through where a second slip would've been. Thick outside edge as Rahane punched and third man had no chance. Taskin Ahmed is a disappointed man, with a double-teapot pose
INDIA:25.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rahane, 2 runs, the 100 has come up in the 26th over, Rahane gets forward and clips it to the left of deep mid-wicket, easy two. The Indians in the crowd cheer, but not too loudly

INDIA:23.1 Taskin Ahmed to Rahane, no run, on a good length and outside off, Rahane gets forward and plays a nice-looking drive, but straight to the fielder at coverTaskin Ahmed [2.0-0-10-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:22.6 Shakib to Rahane, 1 run, Rahane gets forward to flick and misses, Rahim tries to grab the ball, but can't and they take a single to short third man. Did Rahane get a slight inside edge onto the pads? Aleem Dar makes no signal, so it will be runs
INDIA:22.5 Shakib to Rahane, no run, turned to short mid-wicket's right, there was a single there, but Rohit isn't interested. He sends back Rahane who took a few steps out of his crease
INDIA:22.4 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit opens the face of the bat and taps the ball into the gap at cover-point, for a single
INDIA:22.3 Shakib to Rahane, 1 run, had Rahane missed the sweep, that would've been close, he knelt down and got a thin edge onto thigh pad, gets a single to short fine. There was an appeal, but Aleem Dar spotted the edge

INDIA:21.3 Rubel to Rahane, no run, on a good length and outside off, Rahane shows the full face of the bat and gets forward to defend it back to RubelI had a look again at Rubel's reaction after getting Kohli out. He moved towards Kohli and it was Taskin and Rahim who surrounded him and calmed him down, not Mortaza. Apologies for the initial mistake
INDIA:21.2 Rubel to Rahane, no run, short of length on the middle and leg, turned to square leg
INDIA:21.1 Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, short of length outside off, dabbed to the left of backward point, quick single taken

INDIA:20.1 Shakib to Rahane, no run, tossed up outside off, pushed back to ShakibIt has gotten a bit more dark and dull at the 'G'. For the uninitiated I'm referring to the MCG as the 'G'. Basically saving time and my fingers as well
INDIA:19.6 Rubel to Rahane, 1 run, angling in, on a fuller length, flicked to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:19.5 Rubel to Rahane, no run, nearly dragged on! Rubel has his hands on his head. Rahane done in by the low bounce, trying to cut and gets a bottom-edge that bounces into the ground and misses the stumps. So easily could've chopped it back on
INDIA:19.4 Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, short outside off, Rohit lifts one leg up in the air and controls the pull to deep backward square leg
INDIA:19.3 Rubel to Rahane, 1 run, short of length on the hips, nudged off the hips to the right of square legNow Mortaza has given Rubel two slips. Again pro-active captaincy. Bangladesh sense an opening here. They know that India would like to rebuild and this is the time to pile on the pressure and grab a few more wickets. Importantly, Rubel is bowling well, giving nothing away
INDIA:19.2 Rubel to Rahane, no run, pitched up on the stumps, Rahane drives without any timing to mid-on
INDIA:19.1 Rubel to Rahane, no run, Rahane shuffles across and then presents the full face of the bat before defending to mid-onComing back to the Kohli wicket, Mortaza roared and ran up to Rubel to congratulate him. As Kohli was walking off, Rubel wanted to continue his celebrations and moved towards the batsman, looking to give the departing Kohli more lip, but Mortaza came across and stopped his bowler. Sensible thing from Mortaza for Kohli could well have reacted angrily had Rubel met him
INDIA:18.6 Shakib to Rohit, no run, lunges forward and pushes it back to Shakib
INDIA:18.5 Shakib to Rohit, no run, only Rahim appealed there, Rohit down the track and pad-batted that as he wasn't to the pitch of it. Well down the track, highly optimistic from Rahim

INDIA:18.1 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, on middle and leg, turned to deep backward square leg, for a singleGood set-up by Rubel for he tempted Kohli with that outswinger. Early on Kohli is suspect to the full one outside off, his technique isn't tight to the outswinger as one saw on the England tour where James Anderson relentlessly exploited that flaw in his game. Also good captaincy by Mortaza, keeping a slip in place and backing his bowler. The Bangladeshis in the crowd went wild when Kohli got out.
INDIA:17.6 Rubel to Rahane, no run, short of length outside off, Rahane shoulders arms and lets it go. A sighter first up for himAjinkya Rahane, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:17.5 Rubel to Kohli, out Caught by Rahim!! Rubel is pumped and is giving Kohli a send-off. Big moment in the game. After bowling short and back of a length all over, he pitches the ball up and outside off, gets a bit of movement away, tempts Kohli to play away from the body and the outside edge is nicely held by Rahim diving to his right. Rubel running forward pumped his fists and looked at the departing batsman. Kohli just put his head down and walked off. Kohli c Rahim b Rubel 3(8)Rubel to Kohli, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:17.4 Rubel to Kohli, no run, short of length outside off, nips back in a tad and cramps Kohli for room, he defends in front of point, looks for a quick single, but it isn't there

INDIA:16.3 Shakib to Dhawan, out Stumped!! Dhawan overbalanced on the drive and is stumped. Went for a big drive to a tossed up delivery outside off and missed. The back foot is outside the line and Rahim is quick to whip the bails off. Replays show that Dhawan made room and actually one hand came off the bat handle as he went for the big drive. Good work by Rahim too. Dhawan st Rahim b Shakib 30(50) [4s-3]Shakib to Dhawan, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!Rahim has gone up for a stumping appeal against Dhawan. He is confident. Pats Shakib and looks like Dhawan's foot is on the line. No problems with the front foot. 'It's a fair delivery' says the third umpire. Dhawan is out. 'I'm happy with that picture and I'm going to give the batsman out, thank you' reckons the third umpire. Dhawan is gone and cue for wild roaring from the Bangladeshis at the 'G'
INDIA:16.2 Shakib to Dhawan, 2 runs, tossed up outside off, Dhawan opens the face of the bat and square drives to deep point, easy two
INDIA:16.1 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, floated up on middle and leg, Rohit gets forward and eases a drive to long-onShakib Al Hasan, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attackIf India pile up a massive total, it won't be easy for Bangladesh to chase down the target under lights. Even in the 1990s, there was a feeling that under lights at the MCG, the ball tends to zip through the wicket and batsmen find it difficult to stamp their authority on the proceedings.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis for the first 16 overs: On a good track for batting, Bangladesh's pacers bowled on both sides of the wicket and the openers duly took advantage of it by unfurling a series of boundaries. Rohit Sharma, in particular, essayed some imperious drives and forceful pull shots. Rohit also played with soft hands and handled the pacers with aplomb. On the other hand, Shikhar Dhawan looked to play strokes square of the wicket through the off-side. With Taskin Ahmed extracting a bit of bounce, Bangladesh perhaps missed a trick by not positioning a fielder at gully for Dhawan. Interestingly, Mortaza introduced Nasir Hossain into the attack in the sixth over of the innings. Nasir was able to join the dots and build a bit of pressure on the batsmen.Drinks are called for at the 'G'
INDIA:15.6 Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, on a good length and outside off, Rohit stylishly opens the face of the bat and steers it down to third man for a single

INDIA:15.4 Rubel to Dhawan, no run, Mortaza is walking up to Rahim and asks his keeper whether Dhawan had nicked it. Rahim says no and Mortaza walks back. It was down leg and short, Dhawan swivelled on the hook and missed. Snicko doesn't show any spike. Rahim went up immediately and Rubel followed suit. Ian Gould shook his head and he was proved right eventually. The ball was close to the bat, but no edge
INDIA:15.3 Rubel to Dhawan, no run, short ball outside off, Dhawan arches back and lets it goThird time that Dhawan has pulled out. Boos echo around the 'G'. Dhawan apologised immediately and it was the debris flying around that caused the distraction. Rubel though isn't pleased
INDIA:15.2 Rubel to Dhawan, no run, good short ball, catches Dhawan by surprise, Dhawan wanted to pull, but the ball caught up with him very quickly, in the end he jabs it and softly, the ball hits the splice and goes down instantly
INDIA:15.1 Rubel to Dhawan, no run, short of length on off, defended to backward point
INDIA:14.6 Nasir Hossain to Rohit, SIX, the pressure has been released. Rohit choosing the right time to go after Nasir Hossain, use of the feet and to the pitch, before smashing it straight back over the bowler's head. A flat hit and it goes all the way, into the sightscreen. That wakes the Indian crowd up, who had gone a bit silent of late
INDIA:14.5 Nasir Hossain to Rohit, no run, turned to that short mid-wicket fielderPressure building on India, just a bit. Good bowling by Bangladesh. Also it has gone a bit cloudy and gloomy at the 'G'. Breeze blowing too, flags are fluttering everywhere

INDIA:13.5 Rubel to Dhawan, no run, short of length on the stumps, defended to the left of RubelDhawan pulls out as Rubel runs in and that makes the bowler unhappy. He was about to hurl the ball into the ground in disgust. But doesn't do so. Some movement behind the bowler's arm and that irritates Dhawan.
INDIA:13.4 Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, short of length outside off, Rohit opens the face of the bat and runs it down to third man
INDIA:13.3 Rubel to Dhawan, 1 run, short on the hips, doesn't rise too high, Dhawan short-arm jabs a pull to deep backward square leg

INDIA:11.6 Rubel to Dhawan, no run, solidly defended as he gets right behind the line. Rubel has a stare at Dhawan who doesnt't back down
INDIA:11.5 Rubel to Dhawan, no run, Dhawan is crouching low, suggesting the ball kept low and beat him. The feet were stuck in lead as he went for a wooshy cut, but the ball skidded on and beat him. Wanted to play it late too, which meant the pace on the ball worked against him
INDIA:11.4 Rubel to Rohit, 1 run, a huge grunt from Rubel as he delivers the ball, it is short outside off, pulled to deep mid-wicket, played with control
INDIA:11.3 Rubel to Rohit, no run, Rubel hits the bat hard as Rohit presses forward to defend, off the splice and down to point

INDIA:10.5 Mahmudullah to Rohit, 2 runs, short on the stumps, Rohit pulls and the fielder from deep backward square leg runs to his left, dives and pulls it back to the other fielder. Lot of effort put in and the batsmen are happy with just two. Three was possible, but poor running

INDIA:9.4 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, no run, driven to cover
INDIA:9.3 Nasir Hossain to Rohit, 1 run, half-tracker outside off and Rohit nearly gives Nasir Hossain a caught and bowled chance. Very lazy from Rohit as he flat-bats it softly, the ball carries in the air and to the right of the diving Nasir Hossain, who couldn't grab it one-handed, went for the catch, but the ball dipped and hit the turf. They take a single to long-on. Can't really call that a chance, but if Nasir Hossain had been a bit more athletic and anticipated, he could've had a chance

INDIA:8.5 Mortaza to Dhawan, no run, turned to the short mid-wicket fielderNo slips now. A short mid-wicket and a short cover catching. Mortaza isn't running in. He is ambling in and looking to hit a good length. Also bowling a lot of cutters
INDIA:8.4 Mortaza to Dhawan, no run, short of length on the stumps, defended with a straight bat
INDIA:8.3 Mortaza to Dhawan, no run, short outside off, Dhawan went hard on the cut and bottom-edges it to Rahim, on the bounce
INDIA:8.2 Mortaza to Dhawan, FOUR, that is well-timed! Another off-pace delivery, Dhawan waits for it and clips that in the air, through mid-wicket, Nasir runs after it and puts in the head-first dive, but the hands don't go in the right position, can't pull it back and the ball touches the ad-cushions
INDIA:8.1 Mortaza to Dhawan, 2 runs, looked like the cross-seam cutter from Mortaza, it stopped and bounced on Dhawan, who had decided to pull, irrespective of the length, shovels it over the man at mid-wicket running back, the ball clears him and they take a couple
INDIA:7.6 Nasir Hossain to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit goes over mid-off now. Down the track and goes a bit inside-out over the man, once he cleared the man it was four. Rohit was itching to get at Nasir Hossain and chose the right moment

INDIA:7.1 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, no run, Dhawan gets an inside edge that goes between his legs and misses leg stump by a distance, Nasir Hossain and the close-in Bangladeshis were interested for a bit. Dhawan played that with an angled bat looking to defend to cover
INDIA:6.6 Mortaza to Dhawan, 1 run, looked like the cutter, Dhawan waits on the shot and opens the face of the bat to steer it to third man, for a singleDhawan pulls away as Mortaza runs in. Not happy with movement behind the bowler's arm. That is sorted and we are ready to roll once again
INDIA:6.5 Mortaza to Dhawan, 2 runs, another back foot punch, wide of short cover and beats cover to his left. A couple it is as it is not so well-timed to reach the fence
INDIA:6.4 Mortaza to Dhawan, no run, that stopped on Dhawan a tad, he ensures he doesn't punch too hard and hits that to the short cover fielder on the bounce
INDIA:6.3 Mortaza to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan was cramped slightly on the cut, but he created his own room and punched it past the vacant short point position. It was on a back of a length and Dhawan timed the shot really well. Not sure why Mortaza moved that short point fielder to a short cover. It would've been fielded by that fielder, anyway Dhawan gets a boundary
INDIA:6.2 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Rohit opens the face of the bat and dabs that down to third manInteresting to see Mortaza give the ball to Nasir ahead of Shakib, that too in the powerplay. Even Rubel hasn't bowled till now. One plausible explanation for giving Nasir the ball, could be the left-handed Dhawan at the crease
INDIA:6.1 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, full outside off, Rohit plays a solid front foot defence to cover
INDIA:5.6 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, no run, short of length from round the wicket, punched to cover
INDIA:5.5 Nasir Hossain to Rohit, 1 run, Nasir Hossain runs to his right and dives, but cannot stop the single as the ball passes him
INDIA:5.4 Nasir Hossain to Rohit, no run, Rohit is content to have a look at Nasir Hossain, pushed to the bowler's right
INDIA:5.3 Nasir Hossain to Rohit, no run, pushed through outside off, Rohit comes on the front foot to defend it back to the bowler
INDIA:5.2 Nasir Hossain to Rohit, no run, tossed up outside off, Rohit gets forward to defendSlip and a leg slip in place
INDIA:5.1 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Dhawan gets forward and drives to long-off, for a singleNasir Hossain, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
INDIA:4.6 Mortaza to Dhawan, 1 run, good running by Dhawan, just defended that well in front of mid-off and immediately said yes for the quick single. Easily done in the end
INDIA:4.5 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, Dhawan has a smile and a thumbs up to Rohit. Dhawan slipped as the ball passed Mortaza, would've been in danger had Shakib from mid-on, had the presence of mind to see Dhawan slipping and thrown to the keeper, but Shakib fires in a meek throw to Mortaza, who too didn't realise that there was a chance of a run-out. By the time the throw came to the keeper, Dhawan was well home. Half-chance gone for Bangladesh
INDIA:4.4 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, middle and leg line, on a good length, turned softly to mid-wicket
INDIA:4.3 Mortaza to Dhawan, leg byes, 1 run, down leg, runs off the thigh pad as Dhawan misses out on the flick, they take a leg bye
INDIA:4.2 Mortaza to Dhawan, no run, short of length outside off, punched well, but straight to the fielder at short point
INDIA:4.1 Mortaza to Dhawan, no run, gets a bit of indip and cramps Dhawan for room, defended back to the bowlerJust a lone slip now for Mortaza. He has brought in a short point for Dhawan, removing the 2nd slip
INDIA:3.6 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, wayward but Taskin Ahmed gets away. Short and well outside off, Rohit didn't have anything to do with that, left alone
INDIA:3.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 2 runs, and he drifts onto leg, easy pickings for Rohit who clips the bowler through backward square leg, for a couple
INDIA:3.4 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, that's well bowled! Taskin Ahmed has pitched it up and got some late movement to beat Rohit's lazy drive. The feet didn't move and the ball beat the outside edge, not by much. That's where he should target more often, especially if he is getting swing and seam
INDIA:3.3 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, back of a length outside off, defended easily
INDIA:3.2 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit is quick to pull! Was on the front foot and played it awkwardly, but got it to the deep backward square fence. The weight wasn't fully forward, but he somehow swivelled around and played it in the gap, beats the fielder at long leg easily
INDIA:3.1 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, in the air, but doesn't carry to Taskin Ahmed on his followthrough. Rohit got forward to push and checked his shot, softened the defensive shot and the ball was fielded by Taskin Ahmed on the bounceWill keep an eye on Mortaza's reactions. He can get quite hot under the collar. We have seen that happening in this tournament earlier. Especially against Sri Lanka here when the red mist came out of his eyes
INDIA:2.6 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, well played by Rohit in the end. This delivery reared up on him from a back of a length and he did well to play with soft hands. Took the bottom hand out of the handle and kept it down, the ball bounces in front of 2nd slip and goes through the fielder's hands. Mortaza isn't impressed, but third man keeps it to a single
INDIA:2.5 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, Mortaza has pulled his length back nicely after being a tad full off the first delivery, pushed towards mid-off off the back foot
INDIA:2.4 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, on a good length and outside off, Rohit gets forward and defends to cover
INDIA:2.3 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, back of a length outside off, Rohit punches to cover
INDIA:2.2 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, short of length outside off, Rohit rises tall and defends it back to Mortaza
INDIA:2.1 Mortaza to Rohit, FOUR, shot! Picture-perfect from Rohit. Got half-forward and offered the full face of the bat, the ball met the bat and off it went past the umpire, gave no chance to the chasing fielders. The Indian contingent clap with Rayudu leading the way
INDIA:1.6 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, FOUR, Taskin Ahmed spoils all the good work he had done in the over, by bowling a half-volley, Dhawan needed to middle that and put it in the gap and he did so with just a push-drive, into the gap at cover
INDIA:1.5 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, no run, Taskin Ahmed gets away with a leg-side delivery, it swung for him and at pace, but went down leg, Dhawan failed to nail the flick and it rolled off the pad to square leg
INDIA:1.4 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, no run, back of a length outside off and Dhawan steers it from the crease to point
INDIA:1.3 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, no run, short of length outside off, good lines these from Taskin Ahmed, left alone
INDIA:1.2 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, no run, short of length and cramping Dhawan for room, who defends in front of point and looks for a quick single, not there
INDIA:1.1 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, no run, good start by Taskin Ahmed, he lets the short ball go, dug in outside off, Dhawan watches it, arches back slightly and lets it go. Carried well to RahimTaskin Ahmed, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:0.6 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, turned straight to the fielder at mid-wicket
INDIA:0.5 Mortaza to Rohit, leg byes, FOUR, a diving Rahim doesn't get there. Wrong line, down leg, brushes the pad of Rohit and beats the keeper to his left. All it needed was a faint tickle which came via the pad
INDIA:0.4 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, Rohit is right in behind that, defended to cover from the creaseNow Mortaza asks his keeper and the slip cordon to come up a bit
INDIA:0.3 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, Mortaza beats Rohit, but it doesn't carry to Rahim. Rohit played close to his body, but still the inswinger beat Rohit on the forward defensive. No pace from Mortaza, so it meant the ball bounced on the way to Rahim
INDIA:0.2 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, on a length and outside off, Rohit gets forward to defend to cover, looks for a quick single, but Dhawan isn't interested
INDIA:0.1 Mortaza to Rohit, FOUR, super start for India! Long half-volley outside off from Mortaza, Rohit had to reach out and did so, bending his right-knee and creaming a square drive wide of point. Went all along the ground and raced away. The outfield looks in good condition tooRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. Mortaza will open the attackDhawan scored a hundred the last time he batted here. He is a big match player and Rohit would be looking to get his touch back. Sunny and very bright now. The countdown begins and ends quickly. Mortaza is warming up and is ready to go. What a game we have on hand. Two slips in place. Here we go then!The two anthems are done. Magnificent atmosphere at the 'G' today. Even spread of Bangladeshi and Indian supporters in. Green vs Blue. Huge flags in their hands. Dhawan straps his gloves on and walks out along with Rohit. The Bangladeshis are in a team huddle and they break out of it with a spring in their step.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit SharmaBangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Taskin AhmedIndia have won the toss and have opted to batDhoni: "I think it just gets harder and harder. But the thing that makes it easy is, to make some good plans and execute them well because that makes life slightly easy. Other than that I don't think it gets easier. We will bat first. Big match, good wicket, put the runs on the board and look to defend it. Everyone is fit, that's one good thing and that is one thing that we emphasise a lot upon. We want all the players available for selection, fortunately we have been able to keep everyone fit. It's not really in our Indian fast bowling, to keep looking to bowl in the right areas. We have bowlers who have been brilliant, but in between they would try something and give loose deliveries to the batsmen. What this unit has done different from others is that they have kept it in the same area. Even if it's doing a bit, they want to hit the right area. That's a big development for us, not only in this format, it's something that we really need in Test venues also because it makes life a lot easier when you are playing outside the sub-continent. There is scope of improvement everywhere. You may be a good side, you may be playing good cricket, but there are still areas we can improve. If we can manage to do what we have been doing, we will be quite pleased. Not really (when asked if India were taking Bangladesh lightly), every team that has reached the quarter-final is a good side. Every team that participates in the World Cup is a good team. So we have to have that respect. But at the same time you have to be confident about your strengths and where you need to work on. So I feel every team is a good team."Mashrafe Mortaza: "Definitely we are proud. This is the first time we are playing a quarter-final, so we are very positive and hopefully we will give our best today. We would have liked to bat first as well. Only one change, I am coming in place of Taijul (Islam). I am okay to go, hopefully I will give my best today. We have to stop twos and threes and we have to field well. We couldn't field well against Sri Lanka here, so hopefully we will do well today. Rubel (Hossain) and Taskin (Ahmed) are bowling over 142kph, so hopefully they will come with a good plan and deliver."Toss time!Rajaraman adds that it's fine on the weather front for now, but there's some showers predicted later. Will it influence the decision of the captain winning the toss? The ground is filling up fast and there's plenty of support for Bangladesh as well. Should be a cracking atmosphere.Pitch report by Dean Jones: 'This pitch was used recently for the Sri Lanka and Bangladesh game. Even covering of grass.' Except the pitch, stats, stats and more stats from Deano. Also praising the MCG rather than concentrating on the actual square. Lots of random babble and at the end he signs off with: 'bat first, no doubt for me.' Thanks Deano!Our man G Rajaraman is at the ground and he says that both teams are warming up. It's a big match for Bangladesh, their 300th ODI and the first time they will be featuring in a knock-out match in the World Cup.Suresh Raina is quietly confident: "All World Cup games are very important. All matches are going in a pressure situation. We need to just go in there and play to our potential."Quotes now. Mashrafe Mortaza isn't bothered by the past and wants to concentrate on the present: "2007 is a long way in the past. Thinking of it is not going to help us."Sourav Ganguly feels that rain may help Bangladesh. "Rain is Bangladesh's best chance. The shorter the game the more competitive Bangladesh will be. In a curtailed match they will not need to sustain the momentum for 100 overs and that will help them."Weather update: There is a 70% chance of showers predicted in the afternoon/evening. A high of 32C is predicted but rain is expected to make an appearance in the afternoon and evening. Melbourne has been rainy and grey for a couple of days as well.Bangladesh: Mortaza who missed the last game against New Zealand, will be back to lead the side. The rest of the side pick themselves except for one bowling spot. Arafat Sunny, Taijul Islam and Nasir Hossain are fighting for the one spot. It will be interesting to see whether Bangladesh go for a genuine bowler or stick with Nasir Hossain as he can bat as well.Pre-match team news, India: India aren't going to tinker with the winning combination, barring injury.Shakib is hoping there will be a strong Bangladeshi contingent in the crowd as well. "I have played in front of large crowds before but I think this will be different in the sense that the majority will be supporting the other team," he said. "However, this will be an occasion to treasure for the fans and I call upon every cricket follower to make it to the MCG on Thursday."Mortaza said it didn't matter who the fans would support. "The atmosphere will be electric and it will be a thoroughly enjoyable experience for everyone present," he said. "If you are in Melbourne, you should not miss getting a seat at the MCG on Thursday. This could be the last chance for some to become a part of the World Cup legacy. Fan support is important to every team and I believe the Bangladesh fans will come in numbers to cheer us.""The crowds have been outstanding and very supportive, and we look forward to similar encouragement when the Melbourne quarterfinal takes place," Dhoni was quoted as saying in an ICC release. "There are some excellent players on either side and I will encourage people to fill the MCG and enjoy what I think will be an excellent contest."In a move to bring the crowds to watch the quarter-finals, after a disappointing turnout in the first quarter-final at the SCG, the ICC have roped in the services of India and Bangladesh captains Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Mashrafe Mortaza as well as Bangladesh allrounder Shakib Al Hasan to ask their fans to fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the ICC Cricket World Cup knockout quarter-final clash on Thursday."It depends on the day, we need to start well. Whatever we do and if we keep doing that and we keep the momentum in our favour then anything is possible," he said."And, so far in this World Cup, I think we're doing it. If we do exactly what we did against England or New Zealand, I think we'll have a very good game."Meanwhile, Shakib Al Hasan has called for 'fearless cricket' against India. "I think we played fearless cricket (when Bangladesh beat India eight years ago) and we all want to play that brand of cricket that we played," Shakib told a media conference."I'm not saying India will take Bangladesh lightly. In fact, India should not take Bangladesh lightly because at the end of the day, it's a game between two teams and anything can happen. Bangladesh surprised England and went right till the end against New Zealand where better captaincy could have forced a result in their favour. So India should not take them lightly, although on paper and just by statistics India are a far better side than Bangladesh."Sourav Ganguly, writing exclusively on our site warned India not to take the Asian side lightly. "India play Bangladesh tomorrow in the second quarter-final of this World Cup and a lot of people might say that India are 'lucky' to have Bangladesh in the quarters. I would rather go the extra mile and say that India have earned their right to play Bangladesh in the quarter-finals, especially with the way they have played in the group stages. Six games out of six and they have got past every side convincingly, and they deserve to play Bangladesh in the quarter-finals.""We've played a Test Match here and faced Australia and South Africa in ODIs," Raina said of the MCG. "We've spent a lot of time in Australia over four and a half months now. We're used to the conditions more than other teams but we need to go there and play positive cricket. That's it. Keep it simple."Now let us turn our attention on all the talk ahead of the big quarter-final. News from the Indian camp first. "India will keep it simple against Bangladesh." Says Suresh Raina ahead of the game. "As a team, we have done really well in all departments. We took 60 wickets. The fast bowlers have done a lot of disciplined work. I think the credit goes to the staff. They've been doing a great job for us. When it comes to World Cup, you need to just play yourself in and look to have belief in yourself and you can win in any situation," Raina said.Their batting still revolves around Shakib and Rahim, but it has been Mahmudullah who has been a revelation. His back-to-back hundreds against England and New Zealand showed his class and he will be a key man for them in the quarter-final too. Mashrafe Mortaza, Rubel Hossain and Taskin Ahmed have bowled well throughout the World Cup, barring the odd game and if the pitch helps them a bit, they could pose a few problems. Shakib with the ball is looked at to provide control and get the odd wicket or two. Mahmudullah will chip in with the ball too and would be the fifth bowler, should Bangladesh go in with only four bowlers.That win confirmed their place in the quarter-finals and they played New Zealand next. Mahmudullah's second consecutive ton helped them recover after early blows and they fought all the way till the end. Only the ice-coolness of Daniel Vettori carried New Zealand over the line. Bangladesh finished fourth in the group and that meant a quarter-final at the 'G' against India.Bangladesh: Bangladesh started off their campaign on a winning note against Afghanistan, avenging their loss to the same side in the Asia Cup. Then they got a point as their game against Australia was washed out. That point was a bonus as they were up against a very strong Australian side. Sri Lanka brought them back to earth with a thumping win at the 'G' where the bowling and fielding of the Tigers went to pieces. But Bangladesh got their campaign back on track with a win against Scotland where they chased over 300. It was a superb chase and they carried that confidence into their next game against England. It was a winner-takes-it-all battle and Bangladesh held their nerve at the end to come out on top. Rubel Hossain was the star as he yorked James Anderson which sparked off wild celebrations.There is a certain intensity and aggressiveness in the Indian bowling which was clearly missing in the Test and Tri-series in Australia. Ashwin is bowling as well as he has done in his career and with the fielding backing up the bowling, India have all the boxes ticked. They are riding high on momentum and it would take something special to stop them.India look like a side at the top of their game. Dhawan has led from the front at the top with two hundreds and there have been hundreds too for Kohli and Raina. Rahane impressed against South Africa, while MS batted like he always does in a chase against Zimbabwe. Rohit Sharma is the one who needs some runs and the quarter-final might just be the day he gets the big runs. The bowling has been the major plus for India with the line-up taking all the 60 wickets on offer in the league stages.Road to the quarter-final: Played 6. Won 6. 100% record. That is India's record in this World Cup. It all began with a comprehensive win at Adelaide over Pakistan, followed by one more big win against South Africa at the 'G'. UAE were blown away at Perth, while they edged past West Indies at the same venue. Once the top spot was confirmed, India looked to end the group stages unbeaten and they completed that with wins over Ireland and Zimbabwe respectively. While Ireland was handled easily, the Zimbabwe game tested India. They were in trouble chasing, but Suresh Raina's ton and MS Dhoni's calmness ensured a win as the African side flagged at the end.So we wrap the recap segment there and look at how both sides have got to the quarter-finals. Let's start with India.He further continued with more gems flowing from his mouth: "Everyone did well, other than Sreesanth." Sehwag was the first to admit that this was a grudge match after the 2007 defeat. And he finished off with this: "They (Bangladesh) can compete in ODIs, but today they could not."Redemption came in 2011 when India crushed Bangladesh in front of their home crowd at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. It was the opening game of the 2011 World Cup and some termed it the game of Bangladeshi cricketers' lives. Sehwag and Kohli - on his World Cup debut hit hundreds as India racked up 370. Once such a total was put up, it was a no-contest. Sehwag was the star with the bat as he made 175 and his reaction was typical Sehwag - "I am happy that at least once in my career I have batted 47 overs."When someone of the stature of Sachin Tendulkar is so deeply affected by a loss, then you can imagine the impact it has on the psyche. That is where Bangladesh's win ranks in terms of World Cup upsets. It made the entire country go wild with joy, while the reverse was true in India. The loss effectively knocked India's stuffing out. And it marked the slow, but sure end of two of India's finest batsmen - Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. The early exit set alarm bells ringing in India and the slow, but steady rebuilding of the ODI side began after the doomed campaign."The game has been cruel to us and I want to stop. That was when he said, 'can you imagine in 2011 you are here at Wankhede stadium holding that beautiful trophy. That is when you should think of retiring'. That conversation really helped and it motivated me to go out and play with a purpose," the Mumbai-born cricketer said."I still remember (after) 2007 (World Cup) when I came back home, I was so depressed and so upset with the way we had performed. I actually thought of retiring then. I called my brother over, Ajit, and told him that I do not want to continue," Tendulkar said.While the Indian fan's reaction was to be expected. One man who was most affected by the untimely exit of his side was the legendary Sachin Tendulkar. Recently he revealed that he had been heartbroken by India's exit and wanted to quit the game altogether. Sachin was singled out for harsh criticism as he scored just seven and zero against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka respectively. But only his brother's persuasion forced Sachin to continue playing on.Not only was Dhoni targetted but as were Dravid, Tendulkar, Sehwag and others. Posters, effigies and placards were burnt as a mark of protest at India's poor performance. Some even alleged that players spent more time appearing in advertisements than preparing for the World Cup. Typical Indian fan's overreaction!"They raised slogans and asked the Government to take back the plot allotted to Dhoni, who was out for a nought in Saturday's game in the West Indies. The police stepped up vigil at the site and Dhoni's home at Mecon in Ranchi.""In wicketkeeper M.S. Dhoni's hometown Ranchi, about two dozen people gathered near a house being built on a plot given to him by the Jharkhand Government and set afire an effigy to which the player's poster was pasted."So we have seen how Bangladesh reacted. What about India then? This may shock you all. But this is a fact. MS Dhoni may have won everything that there is to win in ODI cricket, but the 2007 game against Bangladesh was one of his lowest points in his career. He was out for a 3-ball duck and saw his house vandalised after the defeat. Security cover was provided to Dhoni's parents after the incident. This is what The Hindu had to say about the incident.So how did Bangladesh as a nation celebrate this win? Bangladesh had been under a state of emergency since January but that was all forgotten as thousands of jubilant fans celebrated into the wee hours, partying and shouting slogans in praise of their nation. Millions of Bangladeshis too had stayed up into the wee hours of Sunday morning to watch the match being shown live from the Caribbean. There were victory processions in Narail - hometown of Mashrafe Mortaza and Chittagong - the place where Tamim Iqbal comes from."We'd beaten India before, but never in a World Cup. We sensed victory once we stopped them at 191. The celebration still rings in my ears. Nobody was coming out of the dressing room. After that day, our respect for each other reached an all new pedestal," says Bashar, who retired from all forms in 2008.Former captain Habibul Bashar, under whose leadership the Tigers defeated India had this to say to the Deccan Chronicle. He was asked to recall that famous win and pointed out that they never had a plan against India in 2007. "When we beat India in 2007, we never had a plan. We knew they were a strong unit but we were more concerned about putting up our best performance. That worked for us. But once it happened, it took a long time for the feeling to sink in," recalls Bashar.Khaled Mahmud, the former allrounder loved the way Bangladesh played the game. "The cricket we played in the first game is simply outstanding. The confident cricket from the young breed actually makes the difference. I always love to see Tamim playing that way."We still have loads of time, so let us look back at that 2007 triumph by Bangladesh. Let us see how former players from Bangladesh reacted to their side's shock win. Former captain, Raqibul Hasan told The Daily Star that Bangladesh's win was the most comprehensive he had seen. "I got emotional not only because Bangladesh won a match against a formidable side but the way they achieved it was incredible. It was truly a professional performance by the boys. I feel fortunate as a former captain that I could see my team playing the game in such a fashion."But take nothing away from Bangladesh's win that day. They were the better side and definitely out-thought, out-batted, out-bowled and out-played India in all three departments. 8 years later, they meet their rivals once again - this time in a knockout game. It's the second quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup and we welcome one and all to our coverage of this game. Sit tight and enjoy whatever we serve up. It's going to be long, lengthy but one thing is guaranteed. We will leave no stone unturned to bring you the best coverage possible. Ready for the ride then? Then chug along with us.India's loss in their opening game upset all plans and eventually they bowed out of the competition in the league stage, after another defeat to Sri Lanka. This for a side that had Rahul Dravid as captain, with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh. The side was coached by Greg Chappell - considered to be one of the most astute of cricketing brains. No-one could point a finger as to what went wrong. It was certainly the lowest point of Dravid, Sachin and Ganguly's ODI careers. That exit caused a lot of introspection and led to soul-searching.But Cricket has a way of surprising people. It throws up the most unexpected of results. Catching everyone unawares. That's what happened on 17th March as Bangladesh registered one of the great upsets in World Cup history, beating a much fancied Indian side. On a slow wicket, India were bundled out for 191 and the score chased down with 9 balls to spare. Zaheer Khan was made to look like a novice as the 18-year old Tamim Iqbal treated with utter contempt. It was a performance worthy and deserving of a win. Bangladesh had come to win and not make up the numbers. They had made a statement. And that statement echoed around the whole of India.12:30 Local Time, 01:30 GMT, 07:00 IST: March 17, 2007. The venue: Queen's Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad. The occasion: A World Cup encounter between India and Bangladesh. Sourav Ganguly vs Tamim Iqbal. Virender Sehwag vs Shahriar Nafees. Rahul Dravid vs Mushfiqur Rahim. Sachin Tendulkar vs Shakib Al Hasan. Zaheer Khan vs Mashrafe Mortaza. Harbhajan Singh vs Abdur Razzak. World beaters vs hopefuls. Heavyweights vs lightweights. Any way you want to look at it, it was a no-contest. At least on paper. India were expected to have a smooth ride against their neighbors from Asia. No-one was even contemplating an upset.Preview:India's intensity, determination and allround skills can combine to overpower a fearless Bangladesh in the quarterfinals of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday. But only if they embrace the right emotions and not complacency that can creep in at the thought of facing the 'easiest' of the opponents in the round of eight.India return to the scene of one of their most memorable wins in this World Cup taming South Africa after beating Pakistan in their opening game in Adelaide. India have managed their recovery and training, including backroom preparation, well. They can add another victory on Thursday if they approach the match with due respect.That India are playing with immense confidence rather than arrogance was shown when they slipped past tricky situations against West Indies and Zimbabwe, thanks to Mahendra Singh Dhoni's calming influence. They will be hoping that the top-order batsmen will not make the mistake of treating Bangladesh's bowlers with a complacent demeanour.There have been attempts to evoke memories of 2007 World Cup when India were surprised by a pack of left-arm spinners and lost to Bangladesh in Port of Spain. But the focus on that would dilute as soon as freeze frames of India's whipping of Bangladesh on their home ground surface.India's bowling attack has acquitted itself admirably, with the team being the only one to claim all 60 wickets in the league phase. In the run-up to this game, the players have found the right mix of intensity and joy.Well as Bangladesh themselves have batted in the World Cup, Mahmudullah scoring back-to-back hundreds against England and New Zealand, their only 300-plus score came against lowly Scotland. Unless their pace bowlers step up the plate, they will find it hard to stop India from making it to the Sydney semifinal against Australia or Pakistan.Undoubtedly, Thursday will be among Bangladesh cricket's biggest days, not because they will be playing their 300th ODI but more since they have put themselves in line for a semifinal spot for the first time. With fearlessness as their accomplice, they will be primed to give it their best shot just as they attempted in their last game against New Zealand.They were fortunate to share points with Australia after rain in Brisbane washed their Group A game off but they showed they had kept in touch with the modern game during their 15-run victory over England in Adelaide. The fast-medium bowling trio of skipper Mashrafe Mortaza, Rubel Hossain and Taskin Ahmed have 19 wickets but can be a handful.Bangladesh coach, Chandika Hathurusingha has often pointed out that the team was not afraid to fail. "If we are paralysed by failure, we are not pushing ourselves, that's what we have talked about throughout this World Cup. I think the freedom to do things and believing in ourselves has been the key. We are backing ourselves to do well," he said.Cricketers and coaches, irrespective of nationality or teams they are attached to, also keep reminding us that the past does not matter as much as what a team does on a given day.
