All that hype and now Gayle turns out to be unfit. Bell, who had a jaw bone fracture is fit and will be playing.Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the 1st ODI between England and West Indies. After winning the Test series comfortably, England will be up against a strong WI side as they are bosltered by the comeback of Gayle, who will be back in the West Indies colors after almost an year. England also has some selection issues with the retirement of KP and have included Bell in their ODI side. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info....Preview by Shashreek RoyCricket is always touted as a team sport, but there are occasions when individuals make the headlines for team contributions. The 1st One Day International between England and the West Indies will be witness to the comeback of two individuals, Ian Bell and Chris Gayle, and there is no doubting which one will make the headlines for that inclusion.There hasn't been a batsman more entertaining than Gayle in the current era as far as limited overs cricket is concerned. If West Indies are to pave their way to revival, then their top order will have to put in a performance much unlike the one that was demonstrated in the Test series. One way of doing that, is by letting Gayle play with the sort of freedom he normally does, for that is a sight that can influence and inspire the rest of the team.England on the other hand, will want to replicate the performance of their Test series in the one day format, something that they haven't done very consistently in the past. In the last two years the "Three Lions" have lost 21 off the 48 ODIs that they have played and their home record is 14 wins in 23 matches, which isn't bad but for their quality they would like it to be higher.Team SpecificsWest Indies: The big talking point is obviously the return of the left handed opener from Jamaica, who will bolster the top order, but another big valuable name that makes his way back to the side is Dwayne Bravo. The all rounder is an asset with bat and ball and should definitely find a place in the middle order.A real problem for the West Indies batting line up is the lack of calm heads. Everyone seems to be a big hitter but none have a passion for playing that crucial sheet anchor role. Perhaps it is time for someone like Marlon Samuels to replicate the sort of application he displayed in the Test series or Gayle, to be as patient as he was in getting his innings started during the recent season of the IPL. If that happens then West Indies will be a formidable unit, but until then it looks pretty much a hit or miss.The bowling seems to be apt for the limited overs format with the likes of Ravi Rampaul and Fidel Edwards set to lead the pace attack. What the line up boasts of in particular is a host of bowlers who can vary their pace and string in some economical overs, a la Dwanye Bravo and Kieron Pollard. Sunil Narine didn't have a very good introduction to Tests but it would be wrong to judge him by that one game, and in the 50 over format he could be a real handful.England: One look at England's squad is enough to reveal a clear void, in the form of Kevin Pietersen, that needs to be filled quite urgently. Alastair Cook has already silenced his critics and proved himself in the shorter version of the game but his partner at the top, Craig Kieswetter, still needs to establish his presence. Jonathan Trott is the perfect number three but his lack of urgency can cause a worry for the English side and that is where KP will be missed. The task of accelerating the innings will now be left to the likes of Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan and Jonny Bairstow, all of whom haven't been very consistent.In damp and seaming conditions there couldn't be an attack better than England's. The duo of James Anderson and Stuart Broad will surely prove to be tricky, much like they were in the Test series. Jade Dernbach with his back of the hand slower deliveries should complement the attack well, if he finds a place ahead of Steven Finn that is. Most tracks will not offer much turn at this time of the season and hence England will probably play only one spinner, that being Graeme Swann, unless they are tempted to try Samit Patel as an all-rounder (no pun intended there).Final verdict: Both sides have a few issues with the batting but have a well structured bowling attack. The side that applies themselves better might just pull through to a win in what should be a closely contested game. England though will start off as favourites and their bowlers should take them across the line.Weather: Unfortunately there is a bit of rain predicted during the course of the 1st ODI, with light rain showers expected in the afternoon. So if you are looking forward to this contest, then you better get your prayers started.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Jonathan Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Steven Finn, Ravi Bopara, Jade Dernbach, Craig Kieswetter(w), Eoin Morgan, Samit PatelWest Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Darren Bravo, Fidel Edwards, Denesh Ramdin(w), Ravi Rampaul, Marlon Samuels, Tino Best, Sunil Narine, Dwayne Bravo, Johnson Charles, Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne SmithLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
