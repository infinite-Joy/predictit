WEST INDIES:48.1 48.1Duminy to Holder, FOUR, finally! Hallelujah! West Indies open the tri-series with a convincing win over the Proteas. Polly is a relieved man and so is the skipper. Holder steps down the track and clobbers the inside-out drive over extra cover, a couple bounces and into the fence to mark the Caribbean victory. The Champion Jig is on as the crowd try out their own moves, not sure DJ Bravo would be pleased. Pollard leaps and pumps his fist in the air to mark the triumph, the players shake hands and et al...Jean-Paul Duminy [1.0-0-8-1] is back into the attackIs this never gonna end? I wonder, 2 runs and I won't be surprised if Windies take 2 more overs. To be fair, the pitch has been slow and West Indies' approach was spot-on

WEST INDIES:46.6 Kyle Abbott to Pollard, no run, more of a flat-batted push into the cover region, just a strike away now
WEST INDIES:46.5 Kyle Abbott to Pollard, 2 runs, another slower ball and Pollard read it early this time. Dabbed it to third man and to be honest he pulled out a second run out of nowhere, seriously nowhere. Sees the third man swoop in very casually and there's no back-up at the bowler's end too. Screams "run, run, run" to his partner...
WEST INDIES:46.4 Kyle Abbott to Holder, 1 run, indipping full ball, biffed down to long-on

WEST INDIES:43.2 Tahir to Pollard, no run, this one too rips away after hitting the good length region, Pollard was lucky not to have nicked that. Went groping after and just belated his late-cut

Darren Bravo lbw b Phangiso 30(69) [4s-2]Phangiso to Darren Bravo, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Darren Bravo has decided to go for a review for an LBW decision. Uncertain to say if there is an inside edge involved as the replay is inconclusive. Given out by the on-field umpire and Bravo has reviewed it straightaway. It's pitched outside off and the impact it is line, so OUT should be the decision and it is. Bravo has to take the walk back to the pavilion.

WEST INDIES:19.6 Tahir to Ramdin, 1 run, came forward, dangled his bat in front of his pad and pushed this attempted pad-wrecker to long-on. West Indies need 126 runs and patience
WEST INDIES:19.5 Tahir to Darren Bravo, 3 runs, pushed it down on leg-stump to which Bravo responds by shaving it off his pad. Almost off an inside edge. Backwards of square leg for three runs
WEST INDIES:19.4 Tahir to Darren Bravo, no run, gets forward and low and blocks the bejeezus out if this
WEST INDIES:19.3 Tahir to Darren Bravo, FOUR, oh, that's a horror ball. A teaser to The Conjuring 2, I tell you. A high, high full toss which Bravo shames over mid-wicket with a pull

WEST INDIES:18.3 Phangiso to Samuels, out Lbw!! Lots and lots of deliberation mid-pitch between Samuels and Bravo, and finally, they decide against a review. That was LBW at first sight. Arm ball skidding off the pitch voraciously to trap Samuels well below the kneeroll. HawkEye suggests that it was hitting the leg-stump. Samuels lbw b Phangiso 1(4)Phangiso to Samuels, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
WEST INDIES:18.2 Phangiso to Samuels, no run, leaves it off the front foot as the ball turns away a touch
WEST INDIES:18.1 Phangiso to Samuels, no run, a drive to this overpitched looped delivery that's placed straight to extra cover
WEST INDIES:17.6 Tahir to Darren Bravo, no run, lovely discipline. Keeps it tight and full on the stumps, and Bravo's flick is then riposted by men lurking on to fire the ball onto the stumps. No run, hence
WEST INDIES:17.5 Tahir to Darren Bravo, no run, drifting onto the pads for Bravo to execute a hold-and-release flick to mid-wicketJust a slip for the right hander
WEST INDIES:17.4 Tahir to Samuels, 1 run, quicker and very full and flat, Samuels skews it to backward point for a singleMarlon Samuels, right handed bat, comes to the creaseThere;s a slip and a short leg in placeDrinks are on the field now. Tahir would need that after two quick wickets
WEST INDIES:17.3 Tahir to Charles, out Bowled!! The one fact that's true is that Tahir's celebrations are independent of the ground attendance, the opposition or the weather. Same high-fisted pumping run. And this ball was a beauty. Drew Charles out of the crease with the flight on this googly which Charles of course did not read. Looked to drive but left a big gap between the bat and pad which the ball breaches. End of the story. End of a lynchpin of an innings. Charles b Tahir 31(52) [4s-4]Tahir to Charles, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!

WEST INDIES:17.1 Tahir to Darren Bravo, 1 run, googly turns away to give Bravo more room on this punchy cut to deep backward pointWest Indies need 138 more. The pitch is a sloth. It's slow and turning, but West Indies look well placed
WEST INDIES:16.6 Phangiso to Charles, no run, driven to cover in defence

WEST INDIES:14.1 Phangiso to Darren Bravo, 1 run, darted outside off and Bravo bunts it to point.

WEST INDIES:13.6 Tahir to Charles, no run, the googly again but it pitches short and turns slowly a long way across. Cards given away too early. Charles winds around but still fails to meet it and is struck on the pad. That wasn't a mistimed shot, can't be. That was a mistimed swivel

WEST INDIES:13.1 Tahir to Darren Bravo, 1 run, floats it across full from over the wicket, too full to call if that was a googly. Driven convincingly off thr front foot to deep cover in placeCharles's left leg gets a workout. The physio is out there, and so is the sock off Charles's feet as that Morris yorker seems to have repercussions. A slight delay here as ABD talks to Tahir. Where was he for so long, AB? Came and took a wicket straightaway to rob a few brownie points. Now, next game, he gets the ball inside the first ten overs, no?

WEST INDIES:12.5 C Morris to Charles, no run, gets the inswing going again as the length stays fullish. Blocked into the leg side
WEST INDIES:12.4 C Morris to Charles, no run, now an extroverted yorker to invite an appeal. Swings on leg-stump, swings too much and Charles crouching dig-out fails. Struck on the back boot but that was easily going down leg

WEST INDIES:7.5 Rabada to Andre Fletcher, no run, another appeal for LBW, but the ball was definitely missing leg, AB doesn't bother to review.

WEST INDIES:7.4 Rabada to Andre Fletcher, no run, short of a good length and well outside off, slapped straight to the fielder at point. Duminy makes a smart save

WEST INDIES:4.1 Kyle Abbott to Andre Fletcher, no run, short of a good length and just outside off, Fletcher shuffles across in defence
WEST INDIES:3.6 Rabada to Charles, no run, loud shout for LBW, but South Africa decide against a review, this was the inswinging yorker, tailed late into Charles, he was shuffling across, jams his bat down in time and squeezes it out, might have been struck on the pads first.

Charles is on strike. Kyle Abbott will open the attackWelcome back.. A below-par batting performance from South Africa. Can their bowlers pull things back? Abbott with the new ball, one slip in placeSouth Africa's World T20 heartbreak recuperation started on a good note, with Amla and de Kock notching up a fifty-run stand to mark the fiftieth time they opened the batting together. But that was about it. When openers fell back to back to Brathwaite and Narine, a 78-run stand between de Villiers and Rossuow ensued - a stand not quick, understandably on a slow pitch, but looked like the spine that could license South Africa to go for the kill later. But Taylor returned to send de Villiers back, thus holding on to the first of the three return chances offered, and Rossouw couldn't rally on much after his fifty. Narine's 6-wicket haul wrecked the hopes of a revival and limited the Proteas to just 188. Now on to the chase..4
SOUTH AFRICA:46.5 Narine to Tahir, out Lbw!! Six wickets for Narine, that's a career-best for him, it's a poor call from umpire Wilson though, not that West Indies will complain. Tahir was happy to go, did he think he got an edge on that and was given out caught at slip? This was the knuckle ball from Narine, pitched on middle and spun into the batsman, Tahir was looking to hoick it over mid-on, missed and was struck on the back-leg, in front of leg-stump, would have been spinning down leg. Umpire Wilson took his time and raised the dreaded finger, South Africa have been bundled out for 188. Tahir lbw b Narine 0(2)Narine to Tahir, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!

SOUTH AFRICA:46.4 Narine to Tahir, 3 wides, that's a shocker from Narine, slips one down the leg-side, Tahir can't lay a bat on that, neither can Ramdin, the ball rolls away behind square on the on-side for some extra runs
SOUTH AFRICA:46.3 Narine to Phangiso, out Caught by Holder!! Five wickets for Narine, he's definitely back! Excellent catch from Holder, a shorter man and this might have well been a boundary for Phangiso. This was tossed up invitingly outside off, Phangiso saw the loop, his eyes lit up as he went for the square drive, he didn't bother to keep it down, on most days, this would have cleared cover. Try telling that to Holder, the big man leaps in the air, went with both hands and clasps it cleanly. South Africa have lost their ninth wicket. Phangiso c Holder b Narine 3(7)Narine to Phangiso, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

SOUTH AFRICA:45.1 Brathwaite to Kyle Abbott, out Bowled!! South Africa are losing their way completely, will they last their full 50 overs! Brathwaite has his second wicket now. This was pitched up around off and held its line, Abbott was rooted to his crease as he looked to defend, might have stayed a tad low as well, he misses and the middle-stump is knocked out from its perch. Celebrations in the Windies camp, they have come back strongly in the last few overs. Kyle Abbott b Brathwaite 5(11)Brathwaite to Kyle Abbott, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Carlos Brathwaite [7.0-0-31-1] is back into the attackAaron Phangiso, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:44.6 Narine to C Morris, out Lbw!! That is as plumb as it gets! Fourth wicket for Narine and he's on a roll today! This was the off-spinner, spun in sharply from outside off, Morris was once again caught in his crease as we went back, the ball thudded into his back-pad, in front of off and was going on to crash into the middle stump.

The batsman was having a leg-stump guard, with plenty of room made outside off. Narine gets one to spin from leg-stump and gets it to spin big. Rossouw is clueless, has been for a while, and just hangs his bat in front for the outside edge to pop to the lone slipper in place.

SOUTH AFRICA:32.4 Brathwaite to Rossouw, 1 run, yorker squeezed round the corner
SOUTH AFRICA:32.3 Brathwaite to Rossouw, 2 runs, that's a short-arm hack. The length had to be shorter given the last delivery and Rossouw cashes in with a crash down to cow corner
SOUTH AFRICA:32.2 Brathwaite to Rossouw, FOUR, everything good about this shot. The lean across to shave the drive through covers, the timing, the placement wide of extra cover and the ease with which that ball flicked over the advertisement-less boundary rope that tempts nostalgia

SOUTH AFRICA:14.5 Narine to Rossouw, 2 runs, with the square open on the leg-side Rossouw will be tempted to play the flicks and the clips. Narine helps his cause with a leg-side dart and Rossouw fetches a couple of runs
SOUTH AFRICA:14.4 Narine to Rossouw, no run, the knuckle ball arrowing in towards middle, Rossouw bends low to see the balll dart in, kept away safely in the end

SOUTH AFRICA:13.6 Brathwaite to de Villiers, 1 run, too full and wide, de Villiers brings his bat down at a angle to squirt it behind backward point

SOUTH AFRICA:13.3 Brathwaite to Rossouw, no run, angled in from a fuller length, a modest drive towards mid-on

SOUTH AFRICA:12.6 Narine to Rossouw, no run, the knuckle ball again, dead-batted
SOUTH AFRICA:12.5 Narine to Rossouw, no run, "Howzaaat" go up the Windies in unison but the umpire isn't interested one bit. Might have been sliding down leg I reckon, pushed through quicker on middle and leg. Rossouw got a big stride forward and failed to lay bat on ball on the defensive push. Was hit in line with leg-stump and I think it's a fair call from the UMP.
SOUTH AFRICA:12.4 Narine to Rossouw, no run, turning away just outside off, Rossouw late-dabs it wide of the lone slip
SOUTH AFRICA:12.3 Narine to Rossouw, no run, the knuckle ball and Rossouw gets lucky, brings his bat closer to his pad to tuck it down the pitch

SOUTH AFRICA:11.4 Brathwaite to Rossouw, no run, edged and just short! This good length delivery nipped away and straightened a fraction around sixth stump line. Rossouw fences at it with his feet stuck in mire, a thick outside edge goes whistling towards the keeper, but lack of bounce meant it fell jussssssssst short
SOUTH AFRICA:11.3 Brathwaite to Rossouw, no run, on off-stump, forward and defended
SOUTH AFRICA:11.2 Brathwaite to Rossouw, no run, full and slightly wide, softly pushed to the off-side
SOUTH AFRICA:11.1 Brathwaite to Rossouw, no run, clear indication that there's lack of bounce on this surface - Justifying AB's move to bat first. Full and dipped in outside off, Ramdin had to stoop very low to glove thatBrathwaite's round the wicket tactic to the left-handers continues. One slip
SOUTH AFRICA:10.6 Narine to de Villiers, no run, quicker but back of a length, AB jumps back to adjust to the low bounce, punched to mid-off

SOUTH AFRICA:10.1 Narine to Amla, out Lbw!! And Narine gets one too! The knuckle ball doing the trick - Oh boy! Look how happy he is... The kind of feeling you get on a Friday night. Amla for some strange reason was trying to counter Narine's spin by standing outside off-stump. This was fired in and straight, Amla's back leg was cemented - Just doesn't move. Tries to flick off the wrists but he played for the wrong line. PLUMB! No hesitation from the UMP. Amla lbw b Narine 20(26) [4s-1]Narine to Amla, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!
SOUTH AFRICA:9.6 Brathwaite to Rossouw, no run, pitched fuller and wider outside off, Rossouw lets it passRilee Rossouw, left handed bat, comes to the creaseOne slip added for Rossouw
SOUTH AFRICA:9.5 Brathwaite to de Kock, out Bowled!! Brathwaite stars - Yet again. He jumps high, pumps his fist and celebrates. Clever stuff from him, he knows QDK was frustrated with the last three deliveries (for not finding the gaps). Bowls a juicy good length delivery but angles it in to tuck him up for room. de Kock was all village there - Just throws his bat without much conviction. Swipes across the line and sees his stumps shattered after turning around. Got a thick inside edge which flicked the bails off in a flash. de Kock b Brathwaite 30(34) [4s-6]Brathwaite to de Kock, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
SOUTH AFRICA:9.4 Brathwaite to de Kock, no run, make that three in a row!!

SOUTH AFRICA:8.5 Narine to Amla, no run, straighter one, Amla pushes it with soft hands
SOUTH AFRICA:8.4 Narine to Amla, 2 runs, this one spins away from Amla, but there's too much width, Amla camps back and flays the cut past backward point, easy double
SOUTH AFRICA:8.3 Narine to Amla, no run, the knuckle ball from Narine, pitches just outside off and darts in slightly, Amla chops just wide of the lone slip
SOUTH AFRICA:8.2 Narine to Amla, no run, Amla shuffles outside off to negate the inward movement, uses his wrists to flick, straight to short mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:8.1 Narine to de Kock, 1 run, flattish and fuller with a round-arm action, driven down to long-offSunil Narine, right-arm off break, comes into the attackHere's Narine after all that ruckus about action remodelling and et al.

SOUTH AFRICA:7.4 Brathwaite to Amla, 1 run, stays back and stabs this to third man
SOUTH AFRICA:7.3 Brathwaite to Amla, 2 runs, "Dive Jason dive" exhorts Ian Bishop on air. The big man isn't certainly pleased with the Windies skipper. Amla drove this full delivery to the left of mid-off, Holder was - for a fleeting moment - ball watching. Starts sprinting once the ball goes past him
SOUTH AFRICA:7.2 Brathwaite to Amla, no run, straight delivery full in length, driven with a closed bat face in front of mid-onNo slip for Brathwaite
SOUTH AFRICA:7.1 Brathwaite to Amla, 2 runs, works this length ball behind square leg and calls for a risky couple, looked struggled while rushing for the second run but managed to drag his bat inCarlos Brathwaite, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:6.6 Jerome Taylor to de Kock, FOUR, QDK is getting better. A drive mixed with aggression and confidence, drivable width and length - He obliges with his front foot leaning towards the pitch of the delivery and the willow just flows, through cover for a scorching boundary
SOUTH AFRICA:6.5 Jerome Taylor to de Kock, 2 runs, slightly fuller and wider, de Kock backs away a touch to counter this scrambled seam delivery, slotted it wide of mid-off and got a double against his name
SOUTH AFRICA:6.4 Jerome Taylor to de Kock, no run, keeps it tight on off-stump, QDK defends compactly
SOUTH AFRICA:6.3 Jerome Taylor to de Kock, no run, a loud scream of "NO" from QDK as soon as he steered it to backward point
SOUTH AFRICA:6.2 Jerome Taylor to de Kock, FOUR, too full and QDK has seen enough of those! Stays flat-footed and drills the drive over the bowler's head, raced away!

SOUTH AFRICA:5.4 Holder to de Kock, 1 run, clever from QDK, just taps this fullish ball under his nose and hustles
SOUTH AFRICA:5.3 Holder to de Kock, FOUR, and nearly nips him out first ball! Angles it in from a good length and forces QDK to put bat to ball, cramped for room is the batsman and he just manages to chop it off the inside edge past the leg peg. Streaky boundaryFrom round the wicket now

SOUTH AFRICA:4.6 Jerome Taylor to de Kock, no run, another one very full in the outside off corridor, de Kock fails to dig it out
SOUTH AFRICA:4.6 Jerome Taylor to de Kock, wide, hoo! That had to be more worse than the second delivery. Tries a slower ball and slips it full and wide outside the tramline, QDK needed a fishing rod

SOUTH AFRICA:4.4 Jerome Taylor to de Kock, no run, slower fullish ball outside off, de Kock keeps it out
SOUTH AFRICA:4.3 Jerome Taylor to de Kock, FOUR, flamboyance! Watch out for this lad, he has every ingredients of becoming the next South African superstar! Short and with the bounce being inconsistent one has to be bold to play a pull so early, he transfers his weight back and rocks the pull through mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:4.2 Jerome Taylor to Amla, 1 run, that's a rank bad delivery and Taylor must consider himself lucky! Dipping full toss sliding down leg, Amla was a smidgen late on the flick. Was late on the shot and as a result fine leg had enough time to cut it off
SOUTH AFRICA:4.1 Jerome Taylor to Amla, no run, goodish length curling in around off, tucked towards mid-wicket

SOUTH AFRICA:1.5 Holder to de Kock, no run, full pitched on the stumps, driven back to the bowler

SOUTH AFRICA:1.3 Holder to Amla, no run, that won't tempt Hashim Amla! He is a classy player and knows his limitations. Shortish and well wide of off, Amla resists and lets it go

As Taylor marks his run-up the sun peeks out too. 2 slips in place, off we go...12:58 Local Time: Good news fellas! The drizzle has eased off. The players gather around to observe a minute's silence remembering one of the West Indian greats Tony Cozier.12:50 Local Time, 16:50 GMT, 22:20 IST: There is news coming in that it is drizzling at the moment at Providence. So, the ground has been covered. Good news folks! It was just a passing shower and it has stopped raining.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Johnson Charles, Andre Fletcher, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Kieron Pollard, Carlos Brathwaite, Jason Holder(c), Sunil Narine, Sulieman Benn, Jerome TaylorSouth Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada, Aaron Phangiso, Imran TahirHolder: We would've bowled first as the conditions are pretty windy. We've been playing IPL and we are not new to this format. Happy to have Kieron and Narine back. People in Guyana really love cricket and last time we played against Pakistan three years ago, there was a good turnout. We've got two spinners and two medium-pacers, myself and Brathwaite.De villiers: Looks like spinners will play a big role so we are playing two spinners. Phangiso and Tahir. We've got lot of options in the batting department. We are looking to bat first and hopefully will look to put up runs on the board. I've enjoyed my captaincy and have got a fantastic team to work with and it's great to be back in the Caribbean. We are excited and rearing to go.South Africa have won the toss and have opted to batThe two captains are out there for the toss. Let's see who gets it right.There are things to look forward to, always is, especially when a West Indian promise, propelled by a new captain in Holder, dates South African pride restoration that's becoming far too frequent to be excused. There's Australia too to spice things up, like always. The IPL hangover starts to clear in three.. two.. one. Purged. Recovered. Ready. Bring it on, please, because I am cricket-starved, not context-starved, thankfully. Toss and teams in a while..12:10pm local: Chris Gayle, Darren Sammy, Dwayne Smith and Dwayne Bravo - the T20 only touchables - aren't a part of this triseries, as a few vicious infantile battles continue to conveniently remain a function of the format of cricket being pursued. We, though, have the young 'Brathwaites' to look forward to, a Sunil Narine whose arm (bent, was it?) has now apparently been flattened by the ICC irons, and a Pollard with a better knee. South Africa just had their umpteenth heartbreak in as many global tournaments, I think, and are back to recover and humble us all, again. de Villiers's form has halted, again, at aggressive stations, so has de Kock's, but IPL form lasts as long as the Indian visa, some claim. We'll find out. Also, Dale Steyn's been rested for the series. Wait, what?12:00pm local: Our interest can be surveyed from the efforts we put in, for or against - efforts to watch West Indies succumb to a drought of self-belief, to clash of egos, even to subsidized oppositions, home and away, despite the Universe conspiring punctual drips in the form of stunning victories like the one at the Eden Gardens to keep them from doing so. The 2012 World T20 win looked burdened with (ambitious) resurrective repercussions as much as this win in 2016, and that's the worry. And just when we are starting to believe that a T20 silverware's claim to rejuvenate West Indies in ODIs and Tests is a sham, here's another tournament to either corroborate or negate the hypothesis that's starting to bore. Will you West Indies, will you, this time, for us?PreviewAnother new season of promise and hope starts off for the West Indies - this time under the leadership of Jason Holder, with several star players from their 2016 ICC World Twenty20-winning squad missing from the One-Day International (ODI) set-up. The problem is for real, the pain of the wait to see West Indies dominate world cricket, the calypso beats being played in convincing show-off.The year 2016 started on the good note for the Caribbean side with World Cup wins for the Under-19, senior men and women's teams. But it is no secret that world dominance still remains a far-fetched ambition at the moment. While their Test standards are not even worth a mention at the moment, their performance in ODIs too haven't been noteworthy. They haven't played a single ODI this year and won only four out of their last 11 games, with two of their wins coming against Zimbabwe and the United Arab Emirates.Despite all their glories this year, and despite being hosts of the tri-series, which features South Africa and Australia as the other two participants, they don't start as favourites at home.They are set to take on South Africa, in the opening clash of the tournament at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Friday (June 3), a side that has been looking to find results worthy of the strength that it boasts of on paper for over a year and a half. Conditions wouldn't be too different from India, where many players from both the sides played in the ninth edition of the Indian Premier League.Sunil Narine has returned to the national fold after undergoing a change of bowling action. But Chris Gayle, Darren Sammy, Dwayne Smith and Dwayne Bravo continue to remain ignored by the Clive Lloyd-led selection panel. Even for home conditions, West Indies don't pose a threatening challenge with the squad. With only four wins in 15 matches since January 2015, there is very little for the Jason Holder-led side to contest that argument.Kieron Pollard, who has a good record with both bat and ball at the Providence Stadium, has recovered from his knee injury that made him sit out from the World T20. He would like to make a purposeful comeback in national colours. Much like Pollard, the start of the new season will also give a platform for Carlos Brathwaite to give a boost to his reputation in 50-overs cricket.South Africa, on the other hand, have made a few crucial changes in their bid to gain consistency in victories. An out-of-form Dale Steyn has been ignored, while Morne Morkel has been drafted in. The tall and lanky pacer will lead a pace attack comprising of Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada, Chris Morris and Wayne Parnell.Parnell, who has been in and out of the national side for nearly eight years, will look to cement his spot in the team as an all-rounder, a spot that he will have to vie for against an in-form Morris.Spinner Tabraiz Shamsi, who impressed in the recently-concluded IPL, has been rewarded with a maiden national call-up. Even as track has played slow in recent times, the presence of part-time off-spinner JP Duminy will leave the left-armer Shamsi to fight for a place in the starting XI alongside Aaron Phangiso.Despite the form of AB de Villiers and Quinton de Kock, the visitors will be concerned with the batting unit that has failed to fire in unison in challenging conditions. Hashim Amla looked scratchy in his maiden IPL season, JP Duminy blew hot and cold and there wasn't much to take away from the oft-benched Rilee Rossouw. With Faf du Plessis, who sustained a broken finger during the IPL, expected to sit out of the opening encounter, batting will be a cause on concern for South Africa.Spinners are likely to get more assistance from the pitch. however, pacers who can bring in their variations, especially the cutters and slower ones, could prove more than a handful. For the batsmen, it will be an interesting test. They may not be able to score freely and will have to bide in their time at the wicket.When: West Indies vs South Africa, June 1, 2016, 10:30 PM IST.Where: Providence Stadium, GuyanaWhat to expect: The weather will remain mostly cloudy with likely thunderstormsTeam news:West Indies: This will be the first international match for West Indies since their World T20 triumph, with a new captain in-charge. Sunil Narine has successfully remodeled his bowling action and Kieron Pollard has recovered from his knee injury. Both will be available for selection.South Africa: Even as Faf du Plessis is in the squad, it is unlikely that he will figure in the starting XI for the opening encounter of the tri-series, having injured his finger in the recently-concluded IPL.What they said:"It's quite a big responsibility to be the all-rounder in the team. It's an opportunity I am trying to grab with two hands. I am trying to grab it and go because it's what I want to do." - Chris Morris,South African all-rounder.Teams:West Indies (From): Andre Fletcher, Johnson Charles, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Shannon Gabriel, Jason Holder(c), Kieron Pollard, Denesh Ramdin(w), Carlos Brathwaite, Jonathan Carter, Sunil Narine, Sulieman Benn, Ashley Nurse, Jerome TaylorSouth Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers(c), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Kyle Abbott, Imran Tahir, Aaron Phangiso, Morne Morkel, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz ShamsiLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
