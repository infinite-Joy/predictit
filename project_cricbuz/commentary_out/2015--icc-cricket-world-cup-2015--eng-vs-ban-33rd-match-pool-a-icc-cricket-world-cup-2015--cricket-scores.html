ENGLAND:48.3 48.3Rubel to J Anderson, out Bowled!! Game, set and match. England are out of the World Cup. What a ball under pressure. Full and fast, swinging away from the left-hander as well, Anderson doesn't get behind the line of the ball, stays leg-side and misses it. The ball crashes into the base of middle-stump. Bangladesh have qualified for the knockouts for the first time. This is the second time in a row that Bangladesh have beaten England in World Cup cricket. J Anderson b Rubel 0(2)Rubel to J Anderson, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

ENGLAND:48.1 Rubel to Broad, out Bowled!! Knocked him over. What a bowler. He has tried so hard all day and delivered quality goods when it mattered. Oh no! They are checking for the no-ball, but Rubel is fine. Pacy length ball at 142.2kph, Broad was not only beaten for pace, but the ball also tailed away from him, Broad exposed all the stumps and it hit the top of off stump. This is a timely wicket from Rubel. Broad has a word with Anderson as he walks off. Gestures to him that the ball is reversing a bit. Broad b Rubel 9(6) [6s-1]Rubel to Broad, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Rubel Hossain [9.0-0-53-2] is back into the attack15 came off the over and England need 16 more to stay alive in the tournament.

ENGLAND:47.4 Taskin Ahmed to Woakes, 2 runs, in the airrrrrrr and he's dropped him. Is that the match? It was a simple chance. Length ball outside off stump, Woakes mistimes the loft, Tamim ran in from long-on and then realises that he has to go back, he does so and gets there in time, tries to reverse-cup it but it pops out. He also tries to grab it with his left hand on the second attempt but it goes to ground. The Bangladeshi fielders and the fans can't believe it
ENGLAND:47.4 Taskin Ahmed to Broad, no ball, 1 run, oh no! It's a waist high no-ball. First warning for bowling a beamer. Taskin Ahmed loses control of this one, it goes well above waist height, Broad tries to guide it fine, but gets the toe end of the bat and it rolls to third man
ENGLAND:47.3 Taskin Ahmed to Broad, leg byes, 2 runs, full and down the leg-side, Broad misses the glance, the ball rolls off the pad to fine leg. A fine little tickle would have been four for Broad and EnglandFine leg comes in and mid-on goes back. So the length is going to be full I guess.
ENGLAND:47.2 Taskin Ahmed to Broad, SIX, he's pulled that and he's connected that very well! This man can bat! He's no mug with the bat. Short ball not rising much, Broad rocks back and pulls powerfully and it goes all the way over deep mid-wicket

ENGLAND:45.6 Taskin Ahmed to Jordan, out Jordan Run Out!! Drama! Absolutely drama out there. I didn't see enough conclusive evidence to rule that OUT, but the third umpire thought otherwise. Firstly, why would you go for a non-existent run at this stage Jordan? He pushed this towards cover and set off immediately, the fielder got to the ball and under-armed it onto the stumps. Jordan turned back and put in the dive, he made his ground but the bat bounced just when the ball hit the stumps. Disaster for England. Coach Peter Moores got up from his seat and walked straight to the fourth umpire to have a chat. Jordan run out (Shakib) 0(1)Taskin Ahmed to Jordan, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Run-out check sent upstairs, but I think Jordan is fine! Oh my word! Has the bat bounced after hitting the ground. It has but is the shoulder of the bat in contact with the grass? It's a toughie! He actually made his ground, but just as the ball hit the stump, the bat bounced. I think the shoulder of the bat is grounded. It's a very, very tough one indeed. Good luck, third umpire! He is taking a long look. The zoomer comes in as well. It's very difficult to tell! Oh! He's given it OUT. That's a brave call! It's a harsh call I think. Phew!Chris Jordan, right handed bat, comes to the creaseOne slip in place.Is this the opening Bangladesh wanted to gain the upper hand?
ENGLAND:45.5 Taskin Ahmed to Buttler, out Caught by Rahim!! Is there a twist in the tale? I was just about to type this is surely England's game now and Buttler has nicked one to the keeper. Nothing but a full ball outside off stump, Buttler backs away and looks to run it down to third man, but he was off balance while meeting the ball and gets a thick edge. Fourth catch for Rahim today. Buttler is absolutely distraught in the dug-out and he holds his head with his hands. He shakes his head as well. Buttler c Rahim b Taskin Ahmed 65(52) [4s-6 6s-1]Taskin Ahmed to Buttler, THATS OUT!!

Shakib comes on! He has to deliver. Can he? The equation is down to 52 off 36 balls.

Ali will take the strike first up.This is going to be an interesting run chase folks. Take a break and join us back at 18:15 local time.Mahmudullah: "I am feeling very good, but would have been very nice if I got few more runs on the board. I think we are 15-20 runs short. But yeah, very special innings for me. When me and Soumo (Soumya Sarkar) were batting, we just thought we should play normally, just wait for the loose ball and keep batting. Today's game is a very special game for us because we've got a chance to qualify for the quarterfinals. We have to bowl well. I think there is a little bit of grip. It is slowing up a bit. If we take early wickets, we will be in the game. Fielding is a crucial part. This is a very special innings for me and I would like dedicate it to my wife and son."It is a must-win game for England and they will feel the pressure of chasing down the target. For Bangladesh, it is about taking wickets with the new ball and then, the spinners can come into play. Anderson generated swing and more importantly, got movement off the deck to take the wickets of both openers, Imrul Kayes and Tamim Iqbal. However, Soumya Sarkar and Mahmudullah helped Bangladesh to make a smart recovery. Jordan provided the vital breakthrough by snaffling the wicket of Sarkar and Moeen Ali followed it up by snaring the wicket of Bangladesh's best player, Shakib Al Hasan. But during the middle part of the innings, they struggled for penetration and the opposition took advantage of it. England though, bowled reasonably well in the end overs to keep the opposition in check.Mushfiqur Rahim, who stitched a key partnership with Mahmudullah, also made an impact by playing a stirring knock. He took quick singles and improvised to frustrate the English pacers. In particular, the way he slog-swept Chris Jordan for a boundary, gave a glimpse of his superb hand-eye co-ordination. Rahim went on to notch up a well-deserved half-century. In the end overs, he also hoicked Chris Woakes across the line for a six. Earlier, it was Anderson, who bowled an impressive spell to take wickets upfront.On the back of Mahmudullah's well-measured century, Bangladesh reached a competitive total on the board. It was also Mahmudullah's first century in ODIs and Bangladesh's first in World Cups. After surviving a testing spell from James Anderson, Mahmudullah played with a calm head on his shoulders to keep the scorecard moving. He also played some cracking shots during his innings. When Bangladesh needed to up the tempo, he lofted Stuart Broad over extra-cover for a boundary in the 36th over of the innings.275 is not a great total, but it is competitive enough. The pitch is still good to bat. Maybe it could assist the spinners later on. It is a tricky target.4

We are left with these two group games, must-win games for us. We had 3 days off which is very nice and then, 2 hard days of training. We are going to bowl first. The pitch looks really good, it's fresh, a drop-in and the short boundary on one side and with a little bit of rain around, it's a little bit sticky so it might swing. We have two changes, Ballance and Finn miss out and Hales and Jordan come in. Hales will be batting at No. 3. I think they will be good and there's always pressure on every game that we play. So, again you prepare for games like this and it's pretty simple for us, if we win these two games, we go through. It's a little bit humid here so hopefully, it will do a bit this morning and we can make early inroads.'Mortaza: 'Boys have been very excited, it is definitely a do-or-die match for us. Hopefully, we will do well today. We would have batted first (if we would have won the toss). Everything is good, except Anamul is injured, so Imrul is coming back into the side. Nasir (Hossain) is not playing, Arafat Sunny is coming in. Back home he got 2-3 centuries in first class cricket, hopefully he will do something similar here. We have Arafat Sunny today and hopefully, he will do the best. Looks to be very good (on the pitch) and the atmosphere is fine here. Hopefully, we will do our best today.'Pitch Report: 'There was some early morning rain. It is one of the 8 drop-in pitches. It generally plays very well and it looks like a very hard surface. Many teams will like to bat first, but with the short side boundary towards the Sir Don Bradman stand, captain who gets the opportunity to win the toss, will look to bowl first,' reckons Tom MoodyWeather Report: Rain was expected today, but luckily the conditions right now are bright and sunny, with a few clouds in the sky. The maximum temperature is expected to hover around 23 degrees Celsius, with the minimum being 13 degrees.Team News: Anamul Haque, who dislocated his right shoulder in the last game, has been replaced by Imrul Kayes in the squad. Kayes was the chief architect of Bangladesh's win over England in the 2011 World Cup, putting up a Man of the Match performance with the bat to take his team through.BLAST FROM THE PAST: Bangladesh will have history behind them when these two teams meet in Adelaide. The last time these two teams met in a World Cup was in 2011, on a slow Chittagong pitch, where Bangladesh first bowled England out for a meagre total of 225. In reply, their batters did extremely well to chase the English total down with 2 wickets in hand.BangladeshIf Bangladesh manage to beat England, they will create history as this will be the first time they will qualify for the knockout stages of a World Cup. However, it is not going to be an easy task at all. Bangladesh's first game was against their Asian counterparts, Afghanistan. The Bangladeshi Tigers put up an all-round show that day, emerging winners by 105 runs. They were lucky that their second game against Australia was washed out, with both teams sharing a point each in the end. In their third game against Sri Lanka, their bowlers took a serious pounding and Sri Lanka managed to post 332/1 on the board. In return, most of their batsmen got starts, but failed to convert it into a big score and the team eventually folded for 240.Their last game was against Scotland and their bowling was again put to the sword, with Kyle Coetzer's 156 guiding Scotland to 318 in their 50 overs. However, it was a flat track and with 50+ scores from Tamim, Mahmudullah, Rahim and Shakib, Bangladesh managed to chase it down with 11 balls to spare, their highest ODI run-chase. However, they will have their task cut-out as they know that a loss today will be a big blow to their chances of making it to the next round. It is important that their bowlers rise to the occasion today and bowl a tight line and length, otherwise they will find it difficult against the Englishmen.EnglandEngland's campaign got off to a poor start, courtesy a defeat to Australia by 111 runs on the opening day of the tournament. Up next, it was New Zealand and the English team got bowled out for a paltry 123 in Wellington. Their only win of the tournament came against Scotland, where Moeen Ali's century inspired them to a 119-run win. In their last game against Sri Lanka, even though they posted 309 on the board, their bowling and fielding disappointed. Sri Lanka, riding on centuries from Thirimanne and Sangakkara, chased down the total in the 48th over, that too with 9 wickets in hand.Their bowling has not been upto the mark. Despite having the likes of Anderson, Broad, Finn and Woakes, the English bowlers have failed to deliver in the World Cup so far, at least against the better oppositions. Their fielding too remains a worry, Woakes dropped Finch in their first game and he went on to score a century. Similarly, Thirimanne was dropped in the last game, not once but twice, before he made them pay by reaching his ton. It will be a good test for their bowling against Bangladesh, but there's no scope of faltering. If they do, they will bow out of the World Cup.Before we go any further, let's take a look at how both the teams have fared so far in the tournament:11:45 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: It is a do-or-die game for England today. If England win this game, they will be in a strong position to qualify for the next round as their final game is against Afghanistan. For Bangladesh, this game also holds similar importance. Even though Bangladesh are 3 points ahead of England in the Pool table, their final game is against the Pool toppers New Zealand and with the kind of form New Zealand are in, it will be extremely difficult to beat them. So, today's game is like a knockout before the knockouts. England will be out of the World Cup if they lose today.Preview:The equation is pretty simple. If England beat Bangladesh in the ICC World Cup 2015 on Monday, their campaign is alive and if they don't they will have to pack their bags. This is also Bangladesh's golden opportunity to reach the quarterfinals for the first time.If Bangladesh could beat England - with New Zealand, Australia and Sri Lanka fairly certain to take the first three spots - the fourth and last spot will surely be theirs. Considering their next opponents are the undefeated New Zealand, England - on its current form - look like the team against which the Bangladeshis could fancy themselves.England's next opponents will be Afghanistan, against whom they should have no difficulty, so tomorrow's match - to all intents and purposes - is the last match in Pool A with real value.Date and Start: March 9, 2014; 9 am ISTVenue: The Adelaide OvalWeather: Rain has been forecast with the temperatures hovering between 17 and 23 degrees CelsiusTeam NewsEnglandDespite having failed to defend 309 for 6 against Sri Lanka in their last match, there are no changes on the cards for England.Probable XI: 1 Ian Bell, 2 Moeen Ali, 3 Gary Ballance, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan (c), 6 James Taylor, 7 Jos Buttler (wk) 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Steven Finn, 10 Stuart Broad, 11 James Anderson.BangladeshBangladesh will have to take a call on whether or not they are playing Imrul Kayes, the replacement for the injured Anamul Haque. Looking at the options and the concept of "opener for opener", he is likely to get a game.Probable XI: 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Imrul Kayes, 3 Soumya Sarkar 4 Mahmudullah, 5 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 6 Shakib Al Hasan, 7 Sabbir Rahman, 8 Nasir Hossain, 9 Mashrafe Mortaza (c), 10 Rubel Hossain, 11 Taskin AhmedPlayers to watch out forJoe Root is one of the few batsmen in the England team who look comfortable against spin. The Adelaide pitch is known for assisting spinners and Bangladesh have got some good spinners in Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman and Mahmudullah. Clearly, Root has got a big task on his hands.For Bangladesh, it has to be Shakib. He has been consistent with both bat and ball - 169 runs and four wickets in four matches - and if the team aspires to upset England, he has to be at his very best.Quotes:We don't need to change anything. We need to be ruthless enough to do the simple things consistently. We haven't done that and that's why we've struggled. It is quite true. This England team is not full of bad players; it is full of good players playing badly. They still have the ability to progress. But the time for talking is over: England captain Eoin Morgan ahead of the contestThey are a very experienced side and know how to deal with pressure games like these. I am not thinking of the quarter-finals yet. The focus is to bat, bowl and field well so that we can trouble England. We should just think about our cricket and not worry about what England have been doing: Bangladesh captain Mashrafe MortazaStats and trivia: - Bangladesh have won two of their last three ODIs against England.- Tamim Iqbal is the only Bangladeshi batsman to have scored a ton against the English team.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Mahmudullah, Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Taijul Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, Shafiul Islam, Arafat Sunny, Imrul KayesEngland (From): Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, James Anderson, Ravi Bopara, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, James TredwellLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
