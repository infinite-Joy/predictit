INDIA:48.4 48.4Southee to Ishant, out Bowled!! Game over. Southee seals it with a fine yorker, which rattles the stumps. Right under the blade of Ishant and it disturbs the timber.

Ashwin c Southee b Williamson 12(10) [6s-1]Williamson to Ashwin, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:47.1 Williamson to Ashwin, 2 runs, another skier and the Kiwis have messed it up again. Baz was running back from midwicket, Southee running in from long-on, both had eyes on the high ball in the air, eventually it falls right in between them as the ball eludes them both.

INDIA:46.3 McClenaghan to Ashwin, SIX, Ashwin seems to have the belief still. Goes deep in his crease and heaves the length ball over deep midwicket, a clean strike and went a long way back into the stands
INDIA:46.2 McClenaghan to Ishant, 1 run, the short delivery, Ishant is on his toes, manages to defend it in front of cover and gives the strike back to Ashwin

INDIA:45.1 Nathan McCullum to Ashwin, out Bhuvneshwar Run Out!! There was no run there and Ashwin seemed to have lost his mind for a while, it was going straight to the fielder at backward point, Ashwin called Bhuvneshwar through, never a chance of making it as an accurate throw to the keeper does the rest. India imploding here at Napier. Bhuvneshwar run out (Williamson/Ronchi) 6(4) [4s-1]Nathan McCullum to Ashwin, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Has Ashwin run Bhuvneshwar out? Bhuvneshwar seems to be walking back to the pavilion. Yes, he is out. Ashwin has sold Bhuvneshwar a dummy. India are 8 down now.

INDIA:44.3 McClenaghan to Bhuvneshwar, 2 runs, just a punch and it rifles past McClenaghan's left-foot, a couple of runsBhuvneshwar Kumar, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:44.2 McClenaghan to Kohli, out Caught by Ryder!! Would you believe it? Kohli has hit a full toss, straight to the fielder at cover. A harmless full bunger and it is driven to Ryder's lap, who takes it and is stoic - nonchalant is the right word. McClenaghan is roaring and roaring in joy. Kohli meanwhile stands there in disbelief, before trudging off to a standing ovation. The Napier crowd are all up to applaud a special knock. McClenaghan has again done it for his side.

He should like this stuff from Nathan McCullumNathan McCullum [8.0-0-42-0] is back into the attackRavichandran Ashwin, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:42.6 McClenaghan to Ravindra Jadeja, out Caught by Ronchi!! The Kiwis are back in it now. Ravindra Jadeja is gone for a duck. He should have learnt from his previous ball error, doesn't, tries to punch on the off-side and outside edges it to Ronchi. Two in the over for McClenaghan. Is that the over that turns this game? Super stuff from McClenaghan. Ravindra Jadeja c Ronchi b McClenaghan 0(3)McClenaghan to Ravindra Jadeja, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Pacy short delivery, above the left shoulder of Dhoni, who gloves the attempted pull, the ball hits his helmet and then goes to the left of the keeper, who runs, then dives to hold on to it, inches from the turf. Dhoni walked - always a good sight to see. A big roar from the bowler, who was entrusted with the task of breaking this stand, which he has done successfully.

Rohit is on strike. Southee will open the attackWelcome back for the chase. The Indian openers have their tasks cut out. Can they stand up to New Zealand's four-pronged pace attack? Let us unravel all the answers.Mohammad Shami was the pick of the Indian bowlers, bowling full, fast and getting just the right amount of help from the surface. He finished with 4 wickets. The spinners too did their job in the middle overs as they kept it tight. The run-chase should be an interesting one, for one has to see whether the Kiwi quick bowlers can extract anything with the new ball. You wouldn't want to miss that. Do join us soon for the Indian reply.A healthy applause for Anderson as he walks off the field with 68 off 40 balls. Very well deserved too, for he provided the impetus with some big hits - with two of them landing on the roof. He was well supported by Brendon McCullum, but India did really well to take wickets at regular intervals to quell any thoughts of a score over 300. It was slow moving for the first 25-30 overs of the innings when Williamson and Taylor took their time to build the base for the onslaught later.4

NEW ZEALAND:47.5 Ishant to Ronchi, out Caught by Bhuvneshwar at short third man!! Good leaping tumbling catch. Ishant claps that effort from Bhuvi.

The Kiwi openers walk out to the middle. Bright sunshine peeks into Napier. It seems like a perfect day for cricket.Brendon McCullum: 'We would have batted first anyways. We played some good cricket against West Indies. This is a completely different challenge. India are a much stronger side. We want to develop some consistency. We have obviously got four very good fast bowling options. On a fast bouncy wicket here, Adam Milne is a good match. It's just the way it is with four high class bowlers. You got to pick horses for courses. Whilst he (Mills) is not playing, he will help out the younger guys.'MS Dhoni: 'We are looking to bowl first. Looks like a good, dry, hard wicket. It means it will not change over a period of time. The practise facility is good. For about four/five days, the batsmen and bowlers spent time. The field positioning and with a strong breeze blowing, you have to take a wise decision. Today seems to be a good day. Every series we play is important for us. It will be good for few guys who have not played in New Zealand to get used to the conditions here. It is a fantastic preparation ahead of the World Cup. The bowlers will have to be smart to bowl in the right areas. If the batsmen get in, we will see some high scores.'Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Adam MilneIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Ishant SharmaIndia have won the toss and have opted to fieldAn enthralling series is on the cards. Fasten your seatbelts and hop on the rollercoaster ride. Toss and team updates to follow shortly.Having failed the pace test in the South Africa ODI series the young Indian batting department will have to rise to the occasion if India are to maintain their top dog status. With Yuvraj Singh given the cold shoulder, either Raina or Rahane will occupy the Number 4 berth. There are a few new faces in the Indian line-up. Stuart Binny, the son of World Cup winning allrounder, Roger Binny, has been given an opportunity to showcase his credentials. Madhya Pradesh quick, Ishwar Pandey, is the other uncapped player in the squad. The injury prone, Varun Aaron makes a comeback to the side after a near one year hiatus.The New Zealand side is riding on a wave of confidence following their impressive showing in the ODIs and T20Is against West Indies. Adam Milne, who clocked 153.6kph during one of the T20Is has created considerable buzz. Tim Southee, who missed the first half of the West Indies series, returns to the side after recuperating from a toe injury. As is the norm, Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor will lead the Kiwi batting.Blustery conditions. Strong gusting wind. The Indians were enveloped in two layers of woolen during their rigorous practise sessions over the past couple of days. The New Zealand skipper, Brendon McCullum and coach Mike Henson have urged the groundsmen to prepare fast, bouncy tracks to intimidate the Indian batsmen. A stiff challenge awaits Mahendra Singh Dhoni's merry men. Hello and welcome to the series opening ODI between India and New Zealand at Napier. Whilst India are the Number 1 ranked ODI side, New Zealand are languishing at 8th place. But that does not tell us the entire story.PreviewIndia would look to gain some valuable experience and confidence when they clash with New Zealand in a five-match ODI series, beginning on Sunday, as Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his boys will begin the defence of their World Cup title on these very shores next year. The reigning World Champions will also be looking to defend their number one ranking, in this format of the game, against the eighth-ranked hosts. Unlike their previous tour in December, this trip imparts greater significance to India. Against South Africa, the Indian team management decided to use the three-match series as a learning exercise for the ensuing Test series. It worked up to an extent against their formidable opponents with their young Test side losing the two-match series only on the last day of the tour at Durban. While the importance of taking that learning forward in the Tests versus New Zealand cannot be neglected, at the same time, India need to up the ante in ODIs as the run-up to their title defence officially begins. India will travel to Australia in the latter part of the 2014-15 season, which will be a final dress-rehearsal, and as such this series against the Black Caps is an important marker in their preparation for the World Cup. The 16-man squad that has arrived here is already a much settled unit, losing only to Pakistan at home and South Africa away in the calendar year 2013, winning six consecutive ODI contests in between. While this provides a good starting point, there are important questions that need to be answered. The first of them is related to the opening combination, with both Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma not doing much in South Africa, ODIs and Tests combined. Sharma perhaps has more time, given that he bats in the middle order in the longer format and particularly because on away tours, the role of openers to give a solid start becomes more important. Murali Vijay performed that bit to perfection in the Tests there, further highlighting Dhawan's plight, who scored only 88 runs in six innings (avg. 14.66) in Africa. Even so, the toughest question pertains to the middle order, given that a misfiring Yuvraj Singh is no longer part of this ODI squad. The number four spot is proving to be a pain ever since this season started against Australia at home. Suresh Raina moved back to this spot in that series but the southpaw himself is struggling for consistency. Either he needs to draw experience of finishing the innings in these conditions, batting at number five or six, or he needs to learn how to drive the batting from number four, in preparation of the World Cup next year. Doing both is not an option for him or the team management. He will need to watch out for Ambati Rayudu and Stuart Binny who will come into contention at some point in this series. Especially the latter, if Raina continues to bat at number five or six, since Binny too is a lower-order batsman. More importantly, he bowls military medium, which could be an additional usage in these windy and bouncy conditions. The pace department looks settled for India. Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami will look to carry on from where they left off in South Africa, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar getting another look-in. Otherwise there is always Ishwar Pandey and Varun Aaron to contend with. It looks like India will play five bowlers, though spin is where the real competition is. R Ashwin needs to win back his Test spot from Ravindra Jadeja and while both are expected to feature in the Indian ODI eleven, this could shape up to be a personal duel between them. For New Zealand too, this series is a good launch-pad to firm up their plans for the future. They have a good base going already, with new players - a healthy mix of ballistic batsmen and good all-rounders - coming through in the preceding West Indies series. The key for them will be to put India under pressure early on in the series, putting the shorter grounds and windy conditions to good use. While skipper Brendon McCullum hinted that they might look to play four fast bowlers on Sunday, the Kiwis' bowling coach Shane Bone was thinking in the longer term. Whilst hosting the World Cup next year, New Zealand will get to play a quarterfinal and a semifinal at their home turf, should they make it that far ahead into the tournament. "We might have to play India in the quarters, or the semis, next year. We too need to size them up and plan ahead," Bond said, ahead of the opening clash of the tour on Sunday.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghan, James Neesham, Adam MilneIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ajinkya Rahane, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Stuart Binny, Ishwar Pandey, Varun Aaron, Ambati Rayudu, Amit MishraLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
