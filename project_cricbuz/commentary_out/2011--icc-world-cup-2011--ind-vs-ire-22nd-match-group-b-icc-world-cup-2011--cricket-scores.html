INDIA:16.1  Stirling to Tendulkar, 1 run, flatter delivery on the leg, Tendulkar flicks it to deep square legTime for a drink. India are coasting along and if this match follows the same path, they will garner two points. A good time to hand over the commentary duties to Karthik - who has been raring to go for some while. Perhaps he too feels the need for this game to get over quickly so that he can have his egg fried rice at the earliest. Here he is and he will take you through till the next drinks break. Time for me (Srivathsa) to leave the stage.Drinks are on the field now

He assesses the pitch and the conditions so well and so quickly, realises he can play on the up and transfers his weight onto the front-foot, before punching it on the up past a diving mid on, a check punch, although it did not come off the middle of the bat, the timing on that shot is tremendous and it races off

INDIA:6.1  Dockrell to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, graceful shot, well tossed up outside off, Tendulkar leant forward and met it with a full blade, stroked with an open face past cover and as all the fielders are inside the ring, it raced away.

INDIA:5.2  Johnston to Gambhir, out Caught by Cusack!! The fine leg is up and generally it means 4 runs. But on this occasion, Gambhir has picked out the man. It was well down leg and Gambhir played the flick off the legs, short fine moved to his right and took a sharp catch. Johnston can't believe his luck. It was almost slipping out of Cusack's grasp, but somehow as he tumbled to the ground, he held on. Gambhir c Cusack b Johnston 10(15) [4s-2] Johnston to Gambhir, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

INDIA:4.1  Rankin to Tendulkar, no run, chipped and fell short of short cover, that one stopped on Tendulkar a tad, he was trying to punch on that up, then stopped his stroke mid way, if he had gone through with that shot, it could well have carried to that manSaurabh Somani now writes in: The single that Sachin Tendulkar took in the previous over is a classic example of why he hates having a runner. It looked risky initially, but he knew the pace at which the ball went to the fielder, called for it straight away and completed the run without any hassles.
INDIA:3.6  Johnston to Gambhir, no run, and a sound backfoot defence to end the over, nice high back-lift and played that well
INDIA:3.5  Johnston to Gambhir, FOUR!!, Gambhir does that often and Johnston has a stare back at him, came down the track and made room to slap the length ball square on the off side, it was in the air, but well wide of any man, calculated risk paying off for Gambhir that time
INDIA:3.4  Johnston to Tendulkar, 1 run, Tendulkar got forward once more and then tapped it between short cover and in front of mid off, the gap was good enough for them to take a single, as Gambhir responded well and in time
INDIA:3.3  Johnston to Tendulkar, no run, short of length delivery outside off, Tendulkar comes on the frontfoot and defends
INDIA:3.3  Johnston to Tendulkar, wide, high bouncer and called a wide, Johnston banged that in hard and the ball went way over Tendulkar's head

INDIA:3.1  Johnston to Tendulkar, no run, Tendulkar is standing well outside the crease to negate the swing or the seam movement, this one he gets forward and tries to close the face to get it wide of short mid, then arrests the shot and taps it close to the right of the bowler
INDIA:2.6  Rankin to Tendulkar, 1 run, closes the face of the bat and clips it down to fine leg, retains the strike with that run

INDIA:1.2  Johnston to Gambhir, no run, good delivery that, fuller length on off stump, Gambhir covers the off stump, leans forward and defends wellGautam Gambhir, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:1.1  Johnston to Sehwag, out Caught&Bowled!! That is some celebration. Johnston has got Sehwag out and the crowd go silent. Sehwag tried to work a harmless delivery down leg, closed the face too early and the leading edge carried back to Johnston. He took it and goes on to do some sort of a jig with both his arms folded. Not sure what he was attempting to do there. The Irish are happy. Sehwag c and b Johnston 5(3) [4s-1] Johnston to Sehwag, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!Trent Johnston, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack

INDIA:0.2  Rankin to Sehwag, 1 run, strays down leg, Sehwag flicks it with elan down to fine leg, a good sliding stop
INDIA:0.1  Rankin to Sehwag, FOUR!!, that's what Sehwag does, first ball of an innings and he has yet again put it away, not a bad delivery at all, back of a length delivery on off stump, Sehwag stood tall and punched that off the backfoot past the off side cordon, raced away and the crowd clear their throatsSehwag and Tendulkar are at the crease. Sehwag is on strike. Rankin will open the attackThe Indian openers stride out to the middle. Sehwag will be on strike and two slips are in place for the man mountain - Boyd Rankin - as he marks out his run-up. The crowd are bustling with energy and it will be Srivathsa to start off proceedings.Yuvraj: It is a great feeling to get 5 wickets. I'm working on my bowling and it is coming out well. Happy to be contributing with the ball. I discuss with MS as to what and where I should bowl on these slow wickets. Gives me great pleasure to get my first 5 wicket haul thanks to god (feels like how it was when I got my 1st hundred). We should chase this down.It was a workmanlike performance from the Indian bowlers as they stuck to a fine line and length to restrict Ireland to a manageable total. Zaheer Khan once again showed how much he had improved of late. This was however followed by the best phase of the Irish innings as Porterfield and Niall O' Brien put up a 113 run partnership which is a record for Ireland for the 3rd wkt in ODI cricket.The middle and later middle order though failed to build on the partnership as the Indian bowlers came back into the match strongly.India, though will feel let down by the fact that the two main spinners Harbhajan Singh and Piyush Chawla failed to create any sort of impact. Harbhajan was his usual self without looking threatening while Chawla was hopelessly poor compounding his misery with no-balls and wides. It was left to Yuvraj Singh to lift the Indian spirits as he broke the Irish back with 5 wkts.There are no demons on this pitch and Ind will back themselves to chase this target. With the surprise loss of SA against England, this group is wide open and the NRR may well come into the equation, India might well be entertaining thoughts of finishing this one early. Do join us in a short while for the Indian chase.4
IRELAND:47.5  Munaf Patel to Johnston, out Lbw!! End of Ireland. Trade-mark Munaf Patel, pitching it on a back of a length and moving it in off the seam. Johnston played across the line and was struck on the pad. Right in front of middle and leg. He took the review as he had to. Replays showed that it was clipping the top of the stumps and the original decision stays. Johnston lbw b Munaf Patel 17(20) [4s-2] Munaf Patel to Johnston, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Johnston has been given out LBW. He is reviewing it. Looks like he is gone and he is. End of the innings.
IRELAND:47.4  Munaf Patel to Johnston, 2 runs, as soon as Johnston played that, he was calling for the 2nd, played softly to long on, wide of the man and they come back for the 2nd, both are tall and a couple of strides and they make it
IRELAND:47.3  Munaf Patel to Rankin, 1 run, he gets off the mark with a nice looking square drive, Yuvi made a half stop at point
IRELAND:47.2  Munaf Patel to Johnston, 1 run, wristed down to long on, brings the 'man mountain Rankin on strike'
IRELAND:47.1  Munaf Patel to Johnston, 2 runs, Yuvi bailed out of the catch for some strange reason. He made good ground running back from mid wicket, then as he was about to catch that, he left the ball to fall on the ground, took his hands out of harm's way. Maybe he was distracted by Kohli running in from deep mid wicketBoyd Rankin, left handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:46.6  Zaheer to Dockrell, out Caught by Dhoni!! Good low catch by MS to his right. A thick edge as Dockrell went for the big booming cover drive, MS moved well and showed sharp hands to grab it inches from the ground. He is appealing for everything. Maybe he is just enjoying a relaxed Sunday game. Looks like he is having some fun. Dockrell c Dhoni b Zaheer 3(10) Zaheer to Dockrell, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
IRELAND:46.5  Zaheer to Johnston, leg byes, 1 run, a wasted review by India, to the naked eye it looked like it pitched outside leg and replays showed it did, Johnston was caught on the pad, in the end a stolen leg byeMS and Zaheer have gone for a review against Johnston. He is given not-out. Did it pitch outside leg? Yes it did and Johnston will stay.
IRELAND:46.4  Zaheer to Johnston, FOUR!!, meaty strike, picked the high full toss and whacked it hard and straight over mid on, wide of the man too, raced away, Ireland needed that
IRELAND:46.3  Zaheer to Johnston, no run, good yorker length delivery on the stumps, Johnston does well to dig it out

IRELAND:46.1  Zaheer to Dockrell, 1 run, fullish outside off, driven to third man
IRELAND:45.6  Munaf Patel to Johnston, FOUR!!, slides down leg, all Johnston had to do was get some bat on it and he did, getting it wide of short fine with a closed face, the shorter boundary that side and the quick outfield does the rest
IRELAND:45.5  Munaf Patel to Dockrell, 1 run, gentle delivery on the middle and leg, tapped wide of square leg for a single
IRELAND:45.5  Munaf Patel to Dockrell, wide, yorker goes wrong, down leg

IRELAND:44.1  Zaheer to Johnston, 1 run, full and outside off, driven square of the wicketBatting powerplay has been taken, how long will Ireland last?

IRELAND:43.5  Yuvraj to Dockrell, no run, gets forward and defendsGeorge Dockrell, left handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:43.4  Yuvraj to Cusack, out Lbw!! What a good review that was! Finally Yuvraj and the 2.5 metres rule have come together and produced a wicket. Last time Bell got away, because Bowden was confused and did not give it out. This time Tucker reverses his decision and sends Cusack back. It was more of an after-thought from MS to take the review, he smiled and asked for it. The decision was changed because the ball was hitting the smack of middle stump. After lots of replays the correct decision has been made. Yuvraj is happy and points out to the dressing room showing his left hand - gesturing he has taken 5. First time he has done so in ODIs. Cusack lbw b Yuvraj 24(30) [4s-3] Yuvraj to Cusack, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!What has happened here? It looked MS was appealing in good humour. As it turns out it is a serious review. They have gone up for an LBW appeal against Cusack, not-out is the original decision. It is more than 2.5 metres. Looks like Cusack would get away again. Only under exceptional circumstances can it be reversed. Will Tucker reverse it? They are taking a long time to make the decision. Lots of replays being shown, the crowd are getting restless.
IRELAND:43.3  Yuvraj to Cusack, no run, didn't straighten enough to be given out, slid down leg and Cusack went on the backfoot to whip it on the on side, high on the pad and replays show that it was clipping the top of the stumps, no way that they could have given that out

IRELAND:41.6  Yuvraj to Johnston, no run, the Aussie born Johnston comes in and immediately defends the first one back to YuvrajTrent Johnston, right handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:41.5  Yuvraj to Mooney, out Lbw!! It's the on-field call even though replays showed that it was just marginally clipping the top of the stumps. Mooney played outside the line of the ball, pitched on off and spun back appreciably to catch him on the pad. 2 reds and an orange on the graphic, but Mooney who guided his side home against England perishes. Yuvraj gets 4. Wonderful spell from him. Is he India's Afridi? Looks like he is heading that path! Mooney lbw b Yuvraj 5(17) Yuvraj to Mooney, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Mooney has been given out LBW. He is reviewing it. Not a no-ball. No inside edge onto the pads. Looks to be out. Sid Mallya is excited and is jumping up and down. Original decision stays.
IRELAND:41.4  Yuvraj to Cusack, 1 run, low full toss on off stump, driven hard to long off
IRELAND:41.3  Yuvraj to Mooney, 1 run, that one stopped on Mooney who took his bottom hand out of the way, got it past the right of Yuvraj

IRELAND:41.1  Yuvraj to Cusack, no run, gets well forward to defend a ball outside off

IRELAND:40.5  Zaheer to Mooney, no run, hint of reverse, moving in with the shiny side, fullish and on off stump, Mooney gets forward and pushes it back to Zaheer

'Miracles don't happen everyday', was what Ganguly said a couple of minutes ago. How well will Ireland fare today? Time for Zaheer and Co. to get some early wickets and get a big win here. That would do a world of good to their WC campaign. Alright, it's me - Ajith - with you for the first twenty overs.Teams:Ireland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien(w), Andrew White, Kevin O'Brien, Alex Cusack, John Mooney, Trent Johnston, George Dockrell, Boyd RankinIndia (Playing XI): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Yusuf Pathan, Piyush Chawla, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf PatelIndia have won the toss and elected to fieldPorterfield: We have four more games left in the group stages, we should play better and better. We need to play well initially, and then assess the target later on. We have one change, we have White in for Wilson.Dhoni: The wicket will assist spinners more in the afternoon than in the evening. The weather gets hotter and hotter as the tournament progresses, there are no fitness issues. We took a day off in between and played Football and Volley Ball. We go in an unchanged side.Toss about to happen folks, the captains walk out.Pitch report: 26 sixes have been scored in the two games that we have had at Bengaluru, the pitch looks a bit drier. There will surely be some purchase for the spinners. The team batting first will find it easy. The spinners will have a much bigger role to play here feels Sunil Gavaskar.Simon Doull made an interesting point on air. Harsha Bhogle threw a question at him 'What is Dhoni's best batting position?' And Doull replied 'Dhoni's best batting position is over No. 35-50, no matter whether India is one down or 5 down.Trent Johnston: England dominated for most part of the game, Kevin's brilliance brought us back in. That was 3-4 days ago, we are playing India today and we know that we have to play much better to compete against the Indians. Hoping to get Sehwag or Sachin out early.Saurabh Somani tweets "Chinnaswamy, Bangalore. Huge roars greet the Indian team members as they come out for practice. Slight cheers for Ireland too. Crowds go wild. You-know-who has just walked out. Stadium not full yet, but the noise will probably be heard in Koramangala!"Niall O'Brien sports a smile and says, I have done about 50-60 interviews, and I feel like a Dhoni or a Sehwag. It's all good for a few days.Another bright and sunny day in store for us at Bengaluru, both teams have arrived at the Stadium and it looks all set for yet another Super Sunday. A warm welcome to each of you. After the Kevin O'Brien heroics the other day against England, the Indians would not be taking the Irish folks lightly, however, do expect a couple of changes in the bowling department just to get the combinations right before it's too late. Well, would it be a cake walk for India? Or, does the World Cup have more upsets to offer? This is Ajith and I will take you through along with my colleagues Pradeep and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be back with more updates..by Saurabh SomaniFour innings played across two matches in Bangalore. Four totals that have crossed 325. The pitch at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, can officially be declared a bowler's graveyard. It readies itself for its third big match under somewhat strange circumstances.
Until a week ago, this match was supposed to be a mere pit-stop for India on their march towards the quarter-finals, but after a tie against England and Ireland's sensational victory over England, this match has assumed a significance that is huge in the context of the Group B points table race.Team NewsIndia: India will need to sort out who their best eleven are for a match. They used three seamers against Bangladesh and two against England. One thing that is unlikely to change though, is the fact that India will continue to play seven batsmen in what is undoubtedly the most feared batting line-up of the World Cup. MS Dhoni indicated as much when he emphasized that India needed to play to its strength. India's strength is undoubtedly batting. And that means the line-up of Tendulkar, Sehwag, Gambhir, Kohli, Yuvraj, Dhoni and Yusuf Pathan will remain as it is. Ashish Nehra is also back to full fitness, which makes the three seamers-one spinner combination more tenable. Even if India go with two spinners, Piyush Chawla's place is not certain. He had a none-too-impressive game against England, and the man waiting in the wings - R Ashwin - has been a good performer when he has got a chance.Ireland: Ireland had a good game against Bangladesh, and for a large part of the match they looked like they were the favourites to win it. However, inexperience more than anything else caused them to lose that match. They proved they were very quick learners though, and in the next match against England, there were no errors and no loss of nerves. What there was, was undoubtedly the greatest chase in World Cup history built on one of the greatest innings played in One Day Internationals. Kevin O'Brien single-handedly ignited a dead match, brought it to life and took his place in World Cup history. More than the win and the two points, what Ireland will now have in all their matches will be belief. They will no longer think of themselves as minnows, and will have the confidence that imbues athletes games with that something extra.Head to Head:India and Ireland have played just one ODI - in 2007 - which India won by 9 wickets. Both O'Brien brothers played for Ireland in that match, but their presence didn't prevent a big defeat. Both teams have undergone changes since then, India in personnel and Ireland in fortunes.Quotes:"We have put Wednesday behind us. We have to start afresh again as we have got bigger challenges ahead." - Ireland captain William Porterfield.
"I've never said there's any weaker side in the World Cup, because if you have memories of getting beaten by Bangladesh in 2007 then you won't commit that mistake." - Indian captain MS Dhoni.
