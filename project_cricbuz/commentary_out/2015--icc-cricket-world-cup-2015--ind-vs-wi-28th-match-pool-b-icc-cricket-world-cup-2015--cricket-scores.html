"Even another Dhoni, on top of himself, may not have hit that," says Hayden on airOnce Rahane was dismissed, West Indies looked to target Suresh Raina with short pitched stuff. On occasions, Raina got into awkward positions, but he seemed to have got through the difficult period. However, he then threw his wicket away to an innocuous delivery from Dwayne Smith. The ball is still swinging for the West Indies, but they need to snare the wicket of MS Dhoni to have any chance of winning the game.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 14 overs: The West Indies' pacers continued to trouble India's batsmen and Kemar Roach was rewarded with the wicket of Ajinkya Rahane. Rahane, who was given out as caught behind by the on-field umpire, Nigel Llong, went for the review. On the review, the snicko showed a small spike and the decision was upheld.Drinks are on the field now

INDIA:15.1 Roach to Rahane, no ball, on a good length and just outside off, defended towards point, but Roach has oversteppedSuresh Raina, left handed bat, comes to the creaseIn fact, historically, the Windies pacers have been lethal at the WACA. The current bowling consultant of West Indies, Curtly Ambrose's awe-inspiring spell of 7 for 25 in a Test match played against Australia in 1993 is still rekindled fondly by fans. Ian Bishop too took a 6-for in the second innings of that Test. As Mark Waugh later in his biography said: "It was going to be almost impossible getting runs against 6'7" blokes [Ambrose, Bishop and Courtney Walsh] on that pitch. And it was." West Indies certainly need their pacers to fire on all cylinders today to win the game. Initially, when Taylor bowled it a touch short, Shikhar Dhawan took advantage of it by collecting four runs in the third over of the innings. It was Taylor, who then provided the crucial breakthrough by bowling from around the wicket to induce Dhawan to edge the delivery and was caught by Darren Sammy in the slips. The length was bang on the money and that resulted in Dhawan getting caught in the crease. Taylor followed it up with another superb delivery to send Rohit back to the pavilion. Rohit too was caught in the crease. Taylor also got the ball to hurry off the surface and that caused Indian batsmen a few problems. Andre Russell then got the vital wicket of Kohli with a short delivery.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 15 overs: The West Indies pacers, Jerome Taylor and Jason Holder bowled well with the new ball. Taylor generated prodigious swing too and snared two wickets. However, the Indian batsmen rotated the strike well and Virat Kohli played some glorious shots through the on-side to keep the scorecard ticking. The West Indies' fielders need to be agile, as the Indian batsmen are looking to steal a single at every given opportunity. Drinks are on the field now

Rohit is on strike. Jerome Taylor will open the attackTwo slips in place for TaylorWelcome back. Can West Indies defend their below-par score?Jadeja: "We are very happy. We did well, the bowlers did their job and now we need to just bat well, initially first 10-15 overs. There is a little bit slow grip on the wicket but very good batting wicket. Initially the ball was moving around a little bit. I don't think so, our batsmen are doing their job very well. They are scoring some runs so I think we need to just look for 10-15 overs initially and then we can get through the total (when asked if 182 was a challenge to the Indian batsmen). We all are doing fielding practice. It happens, it's a part of the game. We need to pull up our socks and just be focussed more. First thing it's a lucky charm for team. We have won the three out of three and secondly I don't look good without the beard, so I always keep growing beard (when asked about how his beard is going)."At the other end of the spectrum, despite Holder and Sammy taking the West Indies to a score of some respectability, they were disappointing. None of the batsmen looked to get used to the pace and bounce on offer at the WACA and hardly played the ball late. Their running between the wickets was poor too. For the West Indies to have any chance of winning this game, their pacers need to strike with the new ball. Ashwin too showed his worth by using the strong breeze to get a bit of shape away from the batsmen and snaffle one wicket. Ashwin has now taken eight wickets in just three ODIs at the WACA. In fact, in the past too, finger spinners have harnessed the breeze to their advantage to take wickets at the WACA. To illustrate the point, Daniel Vettori, the slow left-arm orthodox, used it brilliantly to take a 6-for against Australia in a Test match that was played in 2001. In short, the think-tank have drawn some well thought-out plans and the bowlers have executed it superbly by testing every crevice of a batsman?s defence in this tournament. The only cause for concern for the Indian set-up would be they dropped four catches today.After Gayle and Samuels were dismissed, West Indies continued to wallow in mediocrity. Darren Sammy, who was dropped by Ravindra Jadeja, and Jason Holder tried to hold the innings together. Holder even struck some meaty blows and amassed a fine fifty. But it has to be said that the West Indies ended up with a below par score. For India, Shami took three wickets. Umesh, who bowled a good burst of pace snared two wickets.The Indian coaching staff would be gladdened by the near perfect execution of the short ball tactic. The pacers have rarely wasted the short ball in this World Cup, as they have usually bowled it head high and outside the off-stump.Shami started on a good note by keeping West Indies' opening batsmen, Dwayne Smith and Chris Gayle in check. Smith looked to play a slew of pull shots, but he couldn't connect any of them. Smith's tendency to premeditate didn't help his cause. Shami eventually, bowled a nip-backer to produce the edge and dismiss Smith. Smith's opening partner, Gayle, looked to play himself in before playing a few shots. In particular, Gayle took a heavy toll off Umesh's bowling by clobbering him for a four and a six in the eighth over of the innings. Gayle though, gifted his wicket away, as Shami dismissed him with a short delivery. He also was involved in a terrible mix up with Marlon Samuels and unfortunately for the Windies, Samuels was run out. The Indian bowlers put up an inspired show to land crucial blows at regular intervals and skittle out the opposition ranks for a modest total. It was Mohammed Shami, who bowled with unremitting control and used the breeze that was blowing from left to right to generate a bit of inswing and take wickets upfront. Once Shami gave India a rousing start, the likes of Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin followed up his efforts by bowling with diligence and discipline to put India in a position of strength.4
WEST INDIES:44.2 Ravindra Jadeja to J Holder, out Caught by Kohli!! All over. Holder had to go for it and sliced the loft, completely mistimed and Kohli takes an easy skier at long-off. He throws the ball away after catching it and that's the end of the innings. It may have turned a little and that forced the mishit.

He completed 360 degrees and at the end of the rotation had seen Umesh take the catch. Pretty poor batting and cricketing sense from such a senior member of the team. But then, I have said that previously too, today. Haven't I?

Why not defend the last ball, Jerome? When you have Holder doing all the hitting at the other end. Jerome Taylor c and b U Yadav 11(18) [4s-1]U Yadav to Jerome Taylor, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!

WEST INDIES:40.4 U Yadav to J Holder, 1 run, short down leg, short-arm whipped to fine leg
WEST INDIES:40.3 U Yadav to J Holder, no run, Holder makes room, too much in fact and is lucky that the attempted low full toss, doesn't hit the off stump. Yadav missed the yorker there

WEST INDIES:30.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Sammy, 2 runs, chipped uppishly and over the leaping Ravindra Jadeja. Sammy would've had his heart in his mouth for a fraction of a second.

WEST INDIES:27.3 U Yadav to J Holder, wide, now slips one down leg as he tries the inswingerAs soon as Russell top-edged the hoick, he started walking towards the pavilion.

It has been happening with every wicket that falls
WEST INDIES:27.3 U Yadav to J Holder, wide, short and wide outside off, Holder throws the bat at it and doesn't connect. Called a wide

WEST INDIES:24.1 Ravindra Jadeja to A Russell, out Caught by Kohli!! 'Awful shot, terrible shot' from Ian Bishop on air. From Bish that is. From the ever-diplomatic Bish. The West Indians are playing this like a T20 game and are simply gifting their wickets away. Russell knew as soon as he hit it, that he was gone. Went for a big slog to a tossed up delivery from Jadeja and finds long-off. Kohli comes forward and accepts the catch. A Russell c Kohli b Ravindra Jadeja 8(8) [6s-1]Ravindra Jadeja to A Russell, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Ravindra Jadeja, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attackJadeja tried to take it the Indian way and the ball slipped out of his hands.

WEST INDIES:23.1 Ashwin to A Russell, no run, pushed back to Ashwin
WEST INDIES:22.6 Mohit Sharma to Sammy, no run, dropped by Jaddu at point. Horrible stroke from Sammy, he wound up and skied the length delivery outside off straight up in the air, it was a regulation take for Jadeja but let it slip out of his grasp, despite getting both hands. A couple of his team-mates come up and console him. Sammy gets away with one
WEST INDIES:22.5 Mohit Sharma to Sammy, 2 runs, Sammy doesn't time the pull well, but gets it wide and over mid-on. They take a couple of runs

WEST INDIES:22.5 Mohit Sharma to Sammy, wide, down leg, Sammy can't connect with the flick
WEST INDIES:22.4 Mohit Sharma to A Russell, 1 run, Rohit at mid-off does well to stop a cracking drive from Russell. He dives and then stops the ball. Keeps the batsmen to just a single

WEST INDIES:22.3 Mohit Sharma to A Russell, wide, short and down leg, called wide for height

WEST INDIES:22.1 Mohit Sharma to A Russell, no run, short and outside off, Russell drops his wrists, hops and lets it goThe reaction from Ashwin after the wicket suggested that Shami had misjudged the take and overran the ball.

WEST INDIES:21.6 Ashwin to Sammy, no run, backs away and cuts with an open face, but finds point
WEST INDIES:21.6 Ashwin to Sammy, wide, the carrom ball goes wrong, down leg, Sammy gets inside the line to let goAndre Russell, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:21.5 Ashwin to J Carter, out Caught by Shami!! Top edge and gone. Good catch by Shami at deep backward square leg. Sweeping against Ashwin on this WACA track is invitation for disaster and Carter now finds out why. Down leg, he connected the sweep well, albeit off a top edge, the ball was swirling away from Shami, with the sun distracting him as well. But he keeps his composure and takes it with both hands over his head. After taking it, he rubs his eyes, suggesting the sun was right in his eyes. J Carter c Shami b Ashwin 21(43) [4s-3]Ashwin to J Carter, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
WEST INDIES:21.4 Ashwin to J Carter, no run, beautiful bowling. Ashwin gets this to turn away a little and has an unsure Carter prodding. So close to the outside edge as Carter went back to defend, Dhoni collects
WEST INDIES:21.3 Ashwin to J Carter, no run, rocks back and cuts hard, but finds Jaddu at point

WEST INDIES:18.6 Mohit Sharma to J Carter, wide, that is inside the guideline but called wide by Dharma. Poor stroke from Carter though as he saw the full and wide delivery and went after it. So nearly could've edged that
WEST INDIES:18.5 Mohit Sharma to J Carter, no run, that is a tight and good leave from Carter. Carter left that on length and trusting the bounce. It was close to the off stump, but it didn't nip back in
WEST INDIES:18.4 Mohit Sharma to J Carter, no run, a loud call of 'wait' as Carter flicks and finds mid-on
WEST INDIES:18.3 Mohit Sharma to J Carter, no run, pitched up outside off, left alone
WEST INDIES:18.2 Mohit Sharma to J Carter, no run, dug in short outside off, Carter sways away from the line and lets it goDarren Sammy, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:18.1 Mohit Sharma to Simmons, out Caught by U Yadav!! West Indies are five down now. Once again a batsman falls to the short ball.

Umesh reverse-cups it to his chest as Sharma claps the wicket. Simmons c U Yadav b Mohit Sharma 9(22)Mohit Sharma to Simmons, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

WEST INDIES:17.2 Ashwin to Simmons, no run, spins in and beats Simmons' defensive push, strikes him on the pad, but was going down legJinks is coming in to field at short leg now.

WEST INDIES:16.3 Mohit Sharma to Simmons, no run, width was there that time, but the length was on a back of a length outside off, so Simmons sees that and lets it go
WEST INDIES:16.2 Mohit Sharma to Simmons, no run, short of length outside off, Simmons plays a copybook back foot defensive stroke to the left of Sharma. Held the pose too
WEST INDIES:16.1 Mohit Sharma to Simmons, no run, back of a length outside off, left alone

WEST INDIES:15.1 Ashwin to Simmons, 1 run, tossed up outside off and spins in, Simmons presses forward to defend, but it takes the inside edge and runs to the right of short mid-wicketOnce Gayle got set though, he thwacked Umesh Yadav for a four and a six. However, after surviving a couple of dropped chances, Gayle then threw his wicket away, as he was dismissed by a short delivery from Shami. The Indian seamers have certainly used the short ball cleverly in this World Cup. Gayle was also involved in a terrible mix up with Marlon Samuels and unfortunately for the West Indies, Samuels was run out. To make it worse for the Windies, Denesh Ramdin's lack of footwork yet again cost him his wicket as he dragged one back onto the stumps off Umesh's bowling. Even when Ramdin played his first Test series back in 2005 in Sri Lanka, the likes of Chaminda Vaas and Gayan Wijekoon took advantage of Ramdin's lack of footwork. Shami eventually, dismissed Smith with a nip-backer to produce the edge and for MS Dhoni to take the catch. With the wind blowing from left to right, Shami also generated a bit of inswing. On the other hand, Smith's opening partner, Chris Gayle, looked to play himself in. With his lack of footwork and tendency to go hard at the ball, the pacers concentrated on shaping it away from the left-handed batsman.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 15 overs: Barring the odd short and wide delivery, Indian pacers were impressive with the new ball. It was Dwayne Smith, who looked to be the aggressor for the West Indies by trying to play a slew of pull shots against Mohammed Shami. However, he struggled to connect any of those pull shots. It was clear that Smith was premeditating most of his strokes. Now, batsmen who have succeeded at the WACA watch the ball right onto the bat and use the pace and bounce to their advantage. Damien Martyn, who scored tons of runs for Western Australia and Australia at the WACA, was well known for it.Drinks are on the field now
WEST INDIES:14.6 Mohit Sharma to Simmons, 1 run, nudged in front of mid-on, Sharma can't get across and they take a quick single

WEST INDIES:13.5 Ashwin to J Carter, no run, the skidder! Pushed from the front of the hand, with just a flick of the finger and Carter is eons late on that. Goes back to cut and is trapped on the thigh pad, but the bounce of the WACA pitch means that it would've gone over. Dhoni and Ash look at each other, but don't go for the review. That drifted in appreciably

WEST INDIES:13.3 Ashwin to J Carter, no run, Carter gets forward and defends solidly to short coverSlip and a short cover now

WEST INDIES:9.6 U Yadav to J Carter, no run, pitched up outside off, left alone
WEST INDIES:9.5 U Yadav to J Carter, no run, that hits the splice again, but doesn't carry to third slip. Yadav getting the ball to angle across and producing the outside edge. Carter didn't push out hard too, which ensured that it didn't carry

WEST INDIES:9.3 U Yadav to J Carter, no run, short of length outside off, dabbed to the right of backward pointApalling batting by West Indies. Gayle was at fault for Samuels' wicket and then in a needless show of bravado he threw his wicket away. The need of the hour was to see off the new ball, especially when the wicket was doing so much and the Indians were bowling superbly. But Gayle wanted to show who the boss was and predictably left his team in hot water. Poor stuff from one of the most experienced campaigners in the team. With Ramdin gone first ball, West Indies have a task to bat out the 50 overs
WEST INDIES:9.2 U Yadav to Simmons, 3 runs, full and on middle and leg, Simmons shuffles across a little and clips through mid-wicket. Mohit gives chase and prevents the boundaryLendl Simmons, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:9.1 U Yadav to Ramdin, out Bowled!! West Indies are falling apart now. Ramdin gets out like this a lot of times.

WEST INDIES:8.6 Shami to Gayle, out Caught by Mohit Sharma!! Gayle's over-aggressive instincts costs him. The short ball does the trick for Shami. Gayle went for the pull and top-edged it to the only man at deep square leg. Mohit settles under it and takes it despite the sun right in his eyes. Shami can't believe his luck and has a nervous smile. The West Indians in the crowd are a shell-shocked lot. Gayle c Mohit Sharma b Shami 21(27) [4s-2 6s-1]Shami to Gayle, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

WEST INDIES:8.3 Shami to Gayle, 2 runs, short of length on the ribs, nudged to deep backward square leg, for a coupleNow over the wicketComing back to the Samuels run out, Gayle was just ball-watching. Samuels completed the run and then came back, so a run and a half there. He was very upset at getting out. Gayle just stood there and didn't react at all. He was more worried about the fact that whether Mohit will take the catch or not
WEST INDIES:8.2 Shami to Gayle, FOUR, pitched up and angling in, Gayle stands deep in his crease and hoicks it over mid-on. Opened the front leg and swung well. Gayle is in the mood now

Nearly a catch to mid-on as Gayle spliced the pull, fabulous effort from Mohit, he came charging in and took it on the bounce, after diving forward, he saw that Samuels was halfway and near Gayle. Threw the ball at the non-striker's end, Kohli ran in to collect the throw and effected a simple run-out with Samuels nowhere. That's a gift of a wicket for India.

WEST INDIES:6.5 Shami to Gayle, 1 run, almost a great catch by Umesh at third man! Gayle threw the bat at a full and wide delivery outside off, a thick outside edge was flying to Umesh's right. He ran and dived full length, had the ball in his grasp, till the moment the hands hit the ground. It still was lodged in his chest as he rolled, but popped out. Nevertheless, a magnificent effort and Dhoni applauds that piece of fielding from Umesh. Would've gone down as one of the catches of the tournament
WEST INDIES:6.4 Shami to Gayle, no run, now outside off and no need for Gayle to play at that, he leaves
WEST INDIES:6.4 Shami to Gayle, wide, down leg as Shami loses his radarGreat reaction from Gayle after getting beaten by that ripper. He just opened his eyes and made it as large as possible.

WEST INDIES:4.5 Shami to Dwayne Smith, out Caught by Dhoni!! Shami puts Dwayne Smith out of his misery. Dharmasena had the finger up in a flash. It wasn't there for the cut, it nipped back in and was on a fuller length to be playing the shot, was too close to his body too and Smith just feathered an edge through to Dhoni. Smith's sorry WC continues. Dwayne Smith c Dhoni b Shami 6(20) [4s-1]Shami to Dwayne Smith, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

WEST INDIES:4.2 Shami to Dwayne Smith, no run, when Shami pitches it up outside off and on a fuller length, Dwayne Smith has no clue. He tries to steer that to third man with the slip cordon waiting and predictably gets beaten. Nothing shot!

WEST INDIES:3.6 U Yadav to Gayle, no run, a diving stop to his right by Rahane at backward square leg prevents any runs and gives Yadav a deserved maiden over. Gayle with one leg up in the air, controlled the pull but Jinks pulled out a fine save
WEST INDIES:3.5 U Yadav to Gayle, no run, this time Yadav beats Gayle, despite the batsman playing inside the line, Gayle tried his best to cover the line, but the ball kept following him and nearly got the snick. Not far from the off stump too, Yadav is generating good steam out there

WEST INDIES:3.3 U Yadav to Gayle, no run, further wide of off, left alone

WEST INDIES:3.1 U Yadav to Gayle, no run, softly nudged to mid-on
WEST INDIES:2.6 Shami to Dwayne Smith, no run, Dwayne Smith is all at sea against Shami. Tries to manufacture something out of nowhere, to deny Shami a maiden.

WEST INDIES:2.3 Shami to Dwayne Smith, no run, Dwayne Smith is in all sorts of trouble against the short ball and now gets hit on the stomach. This one hurries him for pace and he looks very ungainly when he is playing those kind of strokes. That has hurt him and he walks away to regain his composure

WEST INDIES:1.2 U Yadav to Dwayne Smith, no run, second time that Dwayne Smith has pulled and nearly pops a catch. This one too is quick onto him and in the end he plays a half-hearted short-arm jab, that doesn't carry to mid-on. The length wasn't there to be playing that kind of a stroke
WEST INDIES:1.1 U Yadav to Dwayne Smith, no run, pitched up outside off, swinging away, Smith sees that and then shoulders armsUmesh Yadav, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackOur man, Tanmoy Mookherjee, is at the ground and he says that the atmosphere is electric at the WACA.

WEST INDIES:0.6 Shami to Gayle, no run, well outside off, easily left alone
WEST INDIES:0.5 Shami to Gayle, no run, loud shout for caught behind from Shami. But nothing from Dharmasena. He shakes his head and says no. Short of a length and rising, angling across Gayle, who poked out to defend, the ball missed the edge, just though and carried nicely to Dhoni. There is a slight movement on Snicko, but India don't take the review
WEST INDIES:0.4 Shami to Dwayne Smith, 1 run, full and down leg, clipped straight to the fielder at fine leg

The Indians are in a huddle and break out of it. Shami to start. Smith to face. Here we go.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit SharmaWest Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Marlon Samuels, Jonathan Carter, Denesh Ramdin(w), Lendl Simmons, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Kemar RoachWest Indies have won the toss and have opted to batDhoni: "We've kept it simple. The only big change that has happened is that the guys are believing more in the process. They have understood the fact that when we are bowling, we have to rely on bowling in specific areas and not to look for wickets, just keep bowling in the right areas and you will get wickets. Same with the batting. Pick your shots when you want to play it rather than putting too much pressure of looking to explode. I am not too disappointed to lose the toss, it looks like a wicket that won't change much. Also I felt there was a bit of swing when we bowled in the other game. I don't think it changes too much, hopefully it will be the same. It just gives us good exposure. If we are needed to chase later on in the tournament we'll be more ready for it. It's a bit of an advantage in the sense that we know how the wicket behaves here. Maybe their batsmen or bowlers will take that extra few overs to know what's the kind of bounce you can encounter over here and what is the right length that you have to bowl as a bowler. Apart from that, I feel with the videos and everything available, most of the international cricketers know they need to alter their batting style or a bit in the bowling length. One change, Shami is fit, he comes back and so Bhuvi has to make space for him."Holder: "We just have to start well in this game against India, it's a must win game for us. I am very confident coming into this game that we can execute. We are going to bat first. Looks to be a good wicket, we want to put runs on the board and then defend it. I wouldn't say there is a specific comfort zone, the wickets have been very good here and we just feel comfortable putting runs on the board. It's just upto us now to defend them. We have to execute our death bowling a lot better than we did in the previous game, but I am confident today that everything will come together. Just one change, Kemar Roach in for Sulieman Benn. We just feel that Kemar is more suited to the conditions."It's toss time folks.Pitch Report: "It's another warm day at WACA, Perth. It is the same pitch that was used for the Afghanistan-Australia game. It is a bit dry and hard. The ball will carry through. There will be bounce and pace. The more you pitch the ball up the more success you will get. If you bowl slower, the spinners will extract some turn. The wicket has something in it for everyone. The team winning the toss will bat first and look to put the runs on the board," reckon Sourav Ganguly and Ian BishopHere is Ashwin talking about how the rule changes in ODI cricket have made bowlers like him 'feel very little'. "I think it's huge in the sense if you get a couple of wickets up front, then the entire game turns on its head," Ashwin said ahead of India's fourth group game against the West Indies at the WACA ground. "As far as the spinner is concerned, when I come in, I've got that little bit more freedom. Having said that, I just made up my mind that I'm going to bowl this way the entire tournament. Come what may, I'll try to execute it, and that is one of the reasons that I've come out to express myself in any of these major tournaments. I like the big stage, and I like to assume I do it my own way."Darren Sammy said that his team needs to bring out their best game against India. "It's another cricket match but India is playing well at the moment. You give each and every opponent the respect that they deserve. We have always had good matches against India and we have to bring out our 'A' game to beat India."On being asked about MS Dhoni, Holder said he has learnt a lot from the Indian skipper. "I've picked up a lot from Dhoni. He's a good leader. He's a guy who is respected in the dressing room. Going about my career I tend to look at a few players and look at a few things people do, not particularly MS Dhoni, but successful players who have played cricket before. I just try to take bits and pieces from everybody and try to put it together into one."Some quotes from both camps before the game. First up is Jason Holder. "I back my bowlers to execute their plans, putting them back and setting them on the back foot," said Holder during the media briefing on the eve of the game. "But they have a pretty good line-up and some good quality players. We've planned for them and we're just looking to execute our plans tomorrow."West Indies: West Indies may have been badly beaten by South Africa, but in all likelihood they will go in with the same side that lost to South Africa, meaning still no place for Kemar Roach.Pre-match team news, India: Mohammed Shami who didn't play in the last game due to a minor knee issue is fit and bowled in the nets prior to the game. He may come in for Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the only likely change for this game.It later turned out that Kohli had intended it for a different journalist. He then apologized through another journalist and the team management chose to play down the incident as a case of 'misunderstanding'.Kohli's emotions had come to a boil at the scenic Murdoch University ground on Tuesday after the team's training session had ended. Before heading towards the nets, the Indian vice-captain confronted a journalist and went on an expletive-filled tirade in full public view.The release also added: "The BCCI has been in touch with the Indian team management on this issue, and has advised that this kind of incident should not be repeated."A bit of controversy and Virat Kohli never go out of place. The Indian vice-captain was reprimanded for losing his cool at a senior journalist just before India's game against the West Indies. His behaviour was reported both to the BCCI and the ICC. "The player in question has been told to maintain the dignity of the Indian team at all times, and avoid any such behaviour in the future. The BCCI would like to request the concerned parties to move on, and focus on the Indian cricket team's campaign in the ongoing ICC CWC 2015," stated the BCCI release.West Indies were on a high coming into their clash against South Africa. They had beaten Pakistan soundly and were up for the clash against the Proteas. They started well with the ball too, keeping things tight till the 20th over. All that changed, once AB de Villiers came out to the middle. Runs flowed like a rampaging river from his bat as he broke one record after another. The white Kookaburra flew to all corners of the SCG as he made the fastest 150 in ODIs. South Africa made 408 and once Gayle was out cheaply, it was the margin of victory that everyone were guessing. West Indies were shot out for 151 giving South Africa a 257-run win. It was the joint highest victory margin in World Cups in terms of runs and severely dented West Indies' NRR.Let's now have a look at how India and West Indies respectively performed in their last outing in this tournament. Starting with India. India simply blew the hapless UAE side, bowling them out for 102 in just 31.3 overs. The UAE batsmen had no clue against India's bowling and it was a stroll in the park for India's batsmen. Rohit Sharma helped himself to a fifty as he sought some form going into the business end of the tournament. That crushing win made it three wins in a row for India and kept their winning momentum going.The relations between the boards might not be the greatest, but the players from both sides get along very well. Thanks largely in part to the IPL. The likes of Gayle, Sammy, Russell and Holder in this current West Indian team are pals with a number of the Indian players. In fact Gayle and Kohli got along like a house on fire when they both played together for the Royal Challengers Bangalore. So don't expect any tension or verbal jousts during the clash at the WACA on Friday.Also the BCCI suspended all bilateral cricket tours with the WICB after the pull-out. "At the moment, it looks unlikely that the bilateral series would resume anytime soon. It will be up to the legal cell now to see if and when a settlement takes place," revealed an insider."The BCCI holds the WICB responsible and liable for all such consequences and intends to enforce its rights to seek compensation from the WICB to the fullest extent permissible in law.""Diwali in India is a monumental disaster for the BCCI. It is during this season that our partners derive the most value from their rights. Our broadcaster had committed to its advertisers during this season and on account of your actions, is facing a severe crisis the effects of which are felt by the BCCI.""The BCCI is faced with huge revenue losses, a loss of reputation and is at risk of losing valuable commercial partners. The consequences of cancellation of a committed home tour during the biggest festival season."That move by the Dwayne Bravo led West Indian side severely upset the BCCI who slapped a $42 million lawsuit, claiming damages stemming from the abandoned tour. "The consequences on the BCCI of not delivering a scheduled home tour to its members, sponsors, broadcasters and the fans are multi-fold and crippling," the BCCI letter said.Gone are the days when a West Indian side evoked fear and awe in equal measure, in an opposition side. Going into today's clash at Perth it's the Indians who are considered favorites to come out on top. Relations between the two cricket boards haven't been cordial ever since West Indies pulled out of India's tour last year due to payment dispute with the WICB.So that is that then on the 1983 triumph. The reason we brought that up today was to put into context what India did to West Indies in a World Cup. It's India versus West Indies again, but how times have changed. Back then West Indies were the all-conquering, mighty power. India were just a another team. Now in 2015, West Indies are a shadow of their former self. Infighting, lack of inspirational leaders, indiscipline, constant squabbling, a farce of a cricket board, lack of interest in the youngsters back home have relegated cricket to the background in the Caribbean.So, why a movie on the 1983 World Cup? "Not many know that India were the underdogs. It was the biggest thing to happen to us in sports. After the win everyone started looking up to us; so it is a good idea to showcase the facts and the reality," says Sanjay.In honor of India's win, a movie is being made on the historic event by Vishnu Vardhan Induri and national award-winning director Sanjay Puran Singh. "It's surprising that no one ever thought of this. Our film is going to be an official biography of the 1983 match," says Vishnu.One more from Shastri: "Being the youngest man in that party, all I'll tell you is that day at Lord's changed my life. June 25, 1983 changed the face of Indian cricket. And when I say that I don't only mean the cricket lovers. The corporate got behind the team, the media started to give the Indian cricket team the recognition they deserve."More from Kapil: "We felt that the 1983 World Cup changed the entire sport in our country and gave a new dimension to Indian cricket."Joel Garner: "For a long time, two or three months, I wouldn't talk to any of my team-mates," he admits. "I would say that the World Cup 1983 was the biggest disappointment in terms of my cricket career."Sunny Gavaskar: "It's something that brings goosebumps even after so many years. At times it is difficult to believe that you were once a part of a World Cup winning team. It is the best moment of your cricketing career to see your captain lift the World Cup up in the air with massive reaction and reception from the huge crowd gathered at Lord's. It was a moment to savour."Ravi Shastri: "We just said, 'let's go out there and enjoy ourselves'. There was no thought of winning or losing. We had played damn good cricket to reach the final and now let's go and enjoy."What did Kapil and his team have to say after their win? First up is Kapil. "We were just a bunch of young boys who wanted to have fun. Winning was more fun in the evening and that's what we started to look out for how we can enjoy more. The first match itself (against West Indies) gave us a little hope. After that our aim was to make the top four. Every match became more and more serious after that."Clive Lloyd, the losing captain gave full credit to Kapil's inspirational leadership. "He's been able to rally the entire team behind him," said Lloyd admiringly, adding: "He's really done a marvellous job." Also Lloyd had this to say at the end of the final: "Indian cricket has arrived. And it's here to stay."A warm welcome to one and all as we begin our coverage of India's clash with West Indies at Perth. Having started off with the 1983 triumph, let's dwell on it for some more time. This is how the newspapers responded to India's giant-killing win. "Kapil's men turn world upside down" screamed the London Times headline while the report went on to term India as "cannonfodder turned cannon".India may have subsequently gone on to win many trophies, including World Cup wins in 2007 and 2011, but till date the 1983 World Cup win is considered to be their finest achievement on a cricket field. Why? Because no-one expected them to win and against one of the all-time great sides in history. Also before that win, cricket wasn't the crazy, popular and all-encompassing sport in the country that it is now. The win gave birth to future legends like Sachin Tendulkar who was inspired to take up the game after watching India win. So one cannot equate the enormity of Kapil Dev's side's triumph.A tremendous explosion of interest since that epic day has seen Indian cricket grow immeasurably and fast forward to 2015, India is the cricketing superpower. One may never know how Indian cricket may have shaped up, had India not won that day, but it can be said that, that triumph inspired millions of Indians to believe and hope that they can achieve great things, not only in the sporting arena but in life too.So what happened then on 25th June 1983? India - against all odds pulled off one of the greatest upsets in sporting history when they defended 183 against West Indies. It was a historic day in the annals of Indian cricket and 'Kapil's Devils' wrote their names into the record books. After that day, cricket in India was never the same and one can safely surmise that Indian cricket can be split into two halves. Before 25th June 1983 and after 25th June 1983.The bookies were offering odds at 50:1 for an Indian win. No-one gave them a chance. Here is an interesting anecdote that encapsulates how even Kapil Dev's wife didn't give her husband's side a chance. Since they had a low score, even the family members, of the cricketers, including Kapil's wife didn't expect them to win. So when the match was going on, Kapil's wife had gone shopping and missed the match. But no one told Kapil about this and he got to know about it only after the match!12:30 Local Time, 04:30 GMT, 10:00 IST: Twice World Champions and red-hot favorites to make it three in a row. Gordon Greenidge. Vivian Richards. Clive Lloyd. Jeff Dujon. Andy Roberts. Michael Holding. Joel Garner and Malcolm Marshall. Versus - Krish Srikkanth. Sunny Gavaskar. Mohinder Amarnath. Syed Kirmani. Kapil Dev. Roger Binny. Madan Lal and Balwinder Sandhu. It was a no-contest at least if you look at the head-to-heads individually. A galaxy of stars versus a bunch of hard-working, honest triers. The fearsome West Indies' side of 1983 led by Clive Lloyd were expected to steamroll India in the final at Lord's.Preview:Events over the last two days relating to a tiff between vice-captain Virat Kohli and a senior Indian journalist have dominated news space, but Friday's Group B fixture against the West Indies presents India with an opportunity to shut out the distractions and continue their unbeaten run in the tournament.It was expected that whatever transpired in Perth over the past two days would be the talking point when an Indian player attended the media interaction ahead of their game at the WACA ground. But as has been the practice, India sent out to the Man of the Match from their previous match, R Ashwin, for the pre-match press conference.Ashwin's pragmatic interaction with the media meant the conversation largely focused on the game at hand and his performance in the previous game against UAE here, where he took career-best figures of 4 for 25. The offspinner's improving form in the tournament has given India more control in the middle overs where he has flourished by attacking the batsmen.Pace bowler Mohammad Shami, who was rested for the previous game against the UAE continued to bowl at the nets, suggesting that he may return to take his place, but whether India would sacrifice Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who had returned from an injury to feature in the game last Saturday, remains to be seen. Bhuvneshwar boasts of a strong record against the West Indies, particularly Chris Gayle, whose threat continues to linger with the big Jamaican having recently smashed the first double century in World Cup history.Predictably, it should be the only area of selection where the Indian team management may have a long discussion about, as the rest of the bowling as well as the batting has impressed in the last three matches. While the top order have been amongst the runs consistently, the likes of MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja in the lower middle order haven't spent enough time in the middle, and against Pakistan and South Africa they were unable to kick on after the top order had set it up for them. But with head coach Duncan Fletcher having rejoined the team, India would look to him as they hope to improve on that aspect of their game.The West Indies, on the other hand, have enjoyed a long rest since their arrival in the city, and save for the odd practice session, have been limited to watching the action from their Group. A heavy defeat to South Africa has meant the West Indies can't afford any more lapses to stay in contention for a spot in the quarter-finals and the game against India will put them under extra pressure.Gayle's back troubles have meant the batsman takes limited part in the team's practice sessions and after a light hit in the nets at the Murdoch University ground on Tuesday, he was seen having a long conversation with chairman of selectors Clive Lloyd, away from the rest of the team. Having given an interview about reconsidering his Test career, he may have been picking Lloyd's brains on reinforcing his belief after the mauling his team received at the hands of South Africa.West Indies captain Jason Holder has fond memories of the WACA ground since he made his international debut here, but knows an opposition like India could easily trip them up. Holder was taken apart by AB de Villiers in the game at the SCG, and how the captain comes back after giving away 104 runs from his 10 overs will speak volumes about his character at the end of Friday's match.Kemar Roach was rested for the previous game but the conditions at the WACA may prompt the West Indies to include him in the side. On both days of the West Indies training, their bowlers were seen practicing death bowling with diligence with the likes of Roach, Jerome Taylor and Andre Russell sending down numerous deliveries to get their yorkers right.The West Indies have crossed the 300-mark in three out of their four matches but their bowlers have also consistently given away runs to make matters tough, and against India on Friday, they would be guarding against a repeat of their SCG performance. India would be mindful of that, and will look to target their bowlers, particularly their 23-year-old captain.Probable XIs:India: 1. Rohit Sharma, 2. Shikhar Dhawan, 3. Virat Kohli, 4.
