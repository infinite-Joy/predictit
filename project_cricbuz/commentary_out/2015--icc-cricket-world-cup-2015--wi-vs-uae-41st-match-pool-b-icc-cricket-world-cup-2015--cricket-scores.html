Aziz will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Johnson Charles will open the innings with Dwayne Smith.Welcome back. West Indies need to chase this in under 36.2 overs to go above Pakistan's NRR. Should be relatively easy. But can they do it without Gayle? Remember the UAE seamers were impressive against India when they moved it up front. Johnson Charles will be making his World Cup debut. He needs to invoke his inner Chris Gayle. Should be an interesting chase this. Also West Indies have to beat the weather that may close in anytime.Remember, before the game started, there was a threat of possible showers hitting Napier. So, this has been a fine performance from the West Indies. It is also a do-or-die match for them, as both Ireland and Pakistan are on six points in Group B and the West Indies were on four before this match. UAE will look to pick up a few wickets up front to give the West Indies a scare or two. On the other hand, the Windies will be eager to chase down this target as soon as possible in a bid to improve their net run rate.It was Amjad, with some hefty blows, and Aziz, who stood up to West Indies' pace attack to take them to a score of some respectability. In particular, Amjad showed decent defence and occasionally, played forceful shots off the pacers to score a crucial fifty. Aziz, who had his fair share of luck early on in his innings also amassed a vital half-century. They put on a superb partnership of 107 for the seventh wicket. It is now the joint highest seventh wicket stand in World Cups.Taylor, who initially, struggled a bit with his line then found his rhythm to bowl a cracker of a delivery that swung in late to knock over Khurram Khan's leg-stump. If that wasn't enough, UAE's best batsman of the tournament, Shaiman Anwar, too was dismissed by Taylor as they found themselves in trouble. In fact, UAE's top-order batsmen showed poor technique against some incisive bowling. This World Cup is a steep learning curve for them. West Indies' captain, Jason Holder, and Jerome Taylor wreaked havoc with the new ball to skittle out the opposition for a modest total. If it wasn't for the resistance shown by Amjad Javed and Nasir Aziz, the UAE could have been bowled out for a score of less than 100. Under overcast conditions, Holder and Taylor extracted movement off the deck and in the air to scythe through the opposition ranks. It was Holder, who made the initial breakthrough by dismissing Andri Berenger. Berenger was caught in the crease and that resulted in him edging it to the wicket-keeper, Denesh Ramdin. Holder continued to hit good lengths and was rewarded with the wickets of Krishnachandran Karate and Amjad Ali. He bowled unchanged and ended up with four wickets to his name.West Indies will be reasonably happy to bowl UAE out for 175, but they should have done better, especially after reducing them to 46/6. They will look to chase this down inside 25 overs to improve their net run rate. There is rain forecast for later in the day and West Indies would hope that the weather is kind on them.4

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:31.1 Samuels to Amjad Javed, no run, flighted delivery just outside off stump, Javed defendsAmjad's partner at the other end, Nasir Aziz, had his fair share of luck and Jason Holder also dropped a tough chance in the slip cordon. However, to his credit, he too showed the determination to stick around and stitch a 50-run stand with Amjad. West Indies' support bowlers haven't exactly been on the money.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 17.1 overs: Lower-order batsman, Amjad Javed, continued to offer resistance by landing a few hefty blows. He played a few good shots that included a forceful cut shot off Kemar Roach that rocketed to the boundary boards. Just like most lower-order batsmen, on occasions, he also backed away in an attempt to thump the pacers. It certainly frustrated the Windies fast bowlers.Drinks are on the field now

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.6 J Holder to Aziz, leg byes, 1 run, down leg, off the padNasir Aziz, right handed bat, comes to the creaseHolder followed it up by bowling another fine delivery to Krishnachandran Karate to beat the edge, before dismissing him in the sixth over. He also sent Amjad Ali back to the pavilion. When Holder bowls on a good length, he can be a handful with the new ball, as he extracts bounce and also seam movement off the deck, on most occasions. To make it a great start for the West Indies, Taylor produced a peach of a delivery that swung back in late to knock over Khurram Khan's leg-stump. There aren't too many better sights in cricket than watching a swing bowler seemingly having the ball on a string. With Taylor knocking over UAE's best batsman, Shaiman Anwar, they were in dire straits.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 13.5 overs: Under overcast conditions, the pace duo of Jerome Taylor and Jason Holder wreaked havoc to leave UAE reeling. It was Holder, who in the fourth over of the innings, found his rhythm and took the wicket of Andri Berenger. It was Holder's ability to extract bounce from a length that resulted in Berenger getting caught in the crease and edge it to Denesh Ramdin, the wicket-keeper.With that wicket, the players have taken drinks as well. Holder seemed to be tiring in that over, but came back with a brilliant delivery to dismiss Swapnil Patil. Seam movement doing the trick. The West Indies have come out like a side possessed and have the UAE 6 down in no time. This could get over very quickly, well before Cyclone Pam hits Napier.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.1 Jerome Taylor to Amjad Ali, 1 run, immediately there is an outside edge and it would've carried to a fourth slip. Jerome Taylor bowls a full length and draws Amjad Ali forward, on the drive, but it flies away to third man, Amjad Ali is off the mark with a streaky shotAmjad Ali and Andri Berenger are at the crease. Amjad Ali is on strike. Jerome Taylor will open the attackJerome Taylor will start. Two slips in place. False start as he loses his run-up. Has a wry smile on his faceCurtly Ambrose is the man leading the talk in the West Indies huddle. He is smiling and that's good to see. A lot of the players look happy too as they listen to the big man. They certainly seem to be in a jovial and relaxed mood. The UAE openers walk out. Today will test them. Overcast conditions and facing Jerome Taylor won't be easy.Pitch report by big Tom Moody: It is a very hard and dry surface. Lots of weather around. UAE has played here before, so they have the experience. Whoever wins the toss would look to bat first and post runs. Average score on this ground in the last 10 games is 293.It is quite overcast out there and West Indies would want to bowl UAE out inside 30 overs and chase it down quickly as the weather doesn't look promising.Teams:United Arab Emirates (Playing XI): Amjad Ali, Andri Berenger, Krishnachandran Karate, Khurram Khan, Shaiman Anwar, Swapnil Patil(w), Amjad Javed, Mohammad Naveed, Mohammad Tauqir(c), Nasir Aziz, Manjula GurugeWest Indies (Playing XI): Dwayne Smith, Johnson Charles, Marlon Samuels, Jonathan Carter, Denesh Ramdin(w), Lendl Simmons, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Kemar RoachWest Indies have won the toss and have opted to fieldHolder: "The preparation was excellent. We had a few days off. We have been here for a little while, so it's all about putting it together today. We are going to field first. Obviously looks a pretty good pitch. We want to get into the UAE batting line-up as quickly as possible. Everything went well in terms of the week's preparation. It is a must-win for us, we've to just come in and execute our plans. We've got one forced change. Unfortunately, Chris Gayle pulled up with a sore back this morning, so Johnson Charles gets his first game. If you look at a replacement for Chris, I think Johnson is ideally fitted for it. He's one attacking batsman, so we just wish him well today."Tauqir: "We are very happy, it has been a very enjoyable and learning experience. We were happy that there were some notable performances from our boys also. We would have liked to have bowled first as well, but now we have no choice and we need to bat and bat well today. We have played some good games in this tournament and we would like to end on a high today. We've got two changes, we've got Nasir (Aziz) in and Manjula (Guruge) coming back."Toss time!What will Jason Holder do if he wins the toss? Does he bat first and hope that his batsmen would post in excess of 350-370 to help them register a big win? Or, does he fancy bowling first and knocking UAE over quickly before going all guns blazing with the bat in the chase? We'll get to know shortly as the toss is not too far away. Today is when West Indies will be looking up to Chris Gayle to put his hand up and play a big innings. Can he deliver the goods? Time will tell!In their encounter against South Africa, UAE opted to bowl first in slightly overcast conditions. After hitting Hashim Amla on the wrist with a beamer, Mohammad Naveed accounted for him soon with a bouncer to give his side the early breakthrough. With Quinton de Kock and Rilee Rossouw falling in quick succession, the Proteas were under a bit of pressure. However, after a close LBW shout against AB de Villiers went against them, they dropped David Miller and the duo made them pay a heavy penalty. A breezy fifty from Farhaan Behardien then helped South Africa post more than what they looked like getting at one stage. In reply, although not going after the target, the UAE batsmen made the South African bowlers earn for their wickets. Swapnil Patil scored a gutsy fifty before his side was eventually bowled out in the 48th over.Let's take a look at how both teams fared in their recent match. West Indies played India in Perth in their last match. After opting to bat first, the West Indies top-order miserably as they were reduced to 35/4 inside 10 overs. Captain Jason Holder then recorded a gritty fifty to give his side a decent score. With a bit of assistance from the pitch, the West Indies bowlers began well by removing both Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma early. Jerome Taylor was the pick of the bowlers as India were put under serious pressure in their run chase. However, they could not remove MS Dhoni as he stayed calm and took India home in the 40th over.Meanwhile, Holder's counterpart, Mohammad Tauqir, feels that West Indies' inferior net run rate will put them under a bit more pressure and that it gives his side an opportunity to play freely. "They're not playing as consistent cricket as they should be and I think they'll be under pressure of chasing the run rate. I think it gives us an opportunity to play freely and express ourselves either batting or bowling."Holder also urged his side to be aggressive against UAE: "I think what is important is that whatever eleven we put on the field we just need to be aggressive. Obviously they seem to not like the aggressive stuff, so it's in our nature to be aggressive and we just need to be aggressive and play aggressive cricket."Talking ahead of the match, newly appointed West Indies captain Jason Holder said that his side should treat this as a normal game and not think about the weather. "Obviously we just need to win this game. It's a must-win game for us. Obviously if the weather plays, it's beyond our control, but we just need to control what we can control, and that's the game. If we can wrap it up as quickly as possible, that's a plus for us, but we still need to cover our bases and just go into the game as a normal game and not try to play the weather."Three teams (Pakistan, West Indies and Ireland) are fighting for the third and fourth spots in Pool B to qualify for the quarter-finals. Here are the scenarios: West Indies, with 4 points so far, are two points behind Pakistan and Ireland, who are on 6 points each. West Indies need to win big against UAE and wait for the final match of the group stage, between Ireland and Pakistan. If West Indies win and if Pakistan beat Ireland, West Indies will go through with Pakistan as Ireland have a poor net run rate compared to both teams. If Ireland beat Pakistan, West Indies can go through only if their win over UAE is big enough to edge Pakistan on net run rate.It's a do-or-die game for West Indies to stay in the race for a place in the quarter-finals. In fact, they not only need to win, but need to win big because of their poor net run rate and also wait for Ireland v Pakistan to know their fate. However, rain threatens to play spoilsport. There are a few showers forecast for later in the day as Cyclone Pam, which is heading towards New Zealand's north-east, is expected to make its landfall late on Sunday night.Preview:Cloudy with a shower in spots: that's how the weather in Napier has been predicted for Sunday, a state that can also describe the situation the West Indies are in ahead of their final 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup Pool B game against the United Arab Emirates on Sunday. Outside the top four in the points table currently, a handsome victory over the team still searching for its first win in a World Cup will keep West Indies in the reckoning for a place in the quarter-finals.It's only after registering a strong victory can they rely on the result between Pakistan and Ireland, the last group game of the World Cup, and hope that Pakistan do them a favour by beating the team who have put them in this situation in the first place.While India and South Africa have already qualified for the knock-outs from group B, Pakistan, Ireland and West Indies are in a three-way battle to occupy the remaining two spots. Pakistan and Ireland both have six points apiece with the former having a slightly better net run rate. West Indies are placed below Ireland with four points, but their NRR is better than that of the William Porterfield-led side. In case West Indies win against UAE and Pakistan prevail against Ireland, both West Indies and Ireland will be tied with six points, but the Caribbean team will progress to the next round as they have a better NRR.If Ireland win against Pakistan and West Indies win against UAE, Pakistan and West Indies will finish with six points apiece but the chances of Pakistan sneaking through are better as their NRR is sightly higher than the Caribbean side. Hence, West Indies will be hoping to win big against UAE, which will better their chances of making it through to the knock-outs even if Pakistan end up on the losing side to Ireland. If either game finishes as a no-result, Pakistan and Ireland will enter the knock-outs.Venue: McLean Park, NapierDate: March 15, 2015Time: 0300 Hrs ISTWeather: Cloudy with chances of rain and a high of 21 degrees Celsius.Team newsWest IndiesAn erratic World Cup campaign is on the cusp of decision day. Their opening defeat to Ireland left them with too much to do, and despite a resounding victory over Pakistan, they have seen more bad days than good in this tournament. After their defeat to India, West Indies have had a long time to recuperate, and have been buoyed by the news of Chris Gayle being passed fit for the fixture.Probable XI: 1. Chris Gayle, 2. Dwayne Smith, 3. Marlon Samuels, 4. Jonathan Carter, 5. Denesh Ramdin (wk), 6. Lendl Simmons, 7. Darren Sammy, 8. Andre Russell, 9. Jason Holder (capt), 10. Jerome Taylor, 11. Kemar RoachUAEAgainst India they looked out of depth, but UAE have left a lasting impression on the tournament, advancing the case for Associate nations to be persisted with in World Cups. In no other game were they outplayed and they have stretched every other opposition with Shaiman Anwar being the shining light of their campaign. In their last game, UAE will try to repeat some of their better performances knowing the West Indies will always give them the chances.Probable XI: 1. Amjad Ali, 2. Andri Berenger, 3. Khurram Khan, 4. Shaiman Anwar, 5. Swapnil Patil (wk), 6. Saqlain Haider, 7. Amjad Javed, 8. Mohammad Naveed, 9. Mohammad Tauqir (capt), 10. Kamran Shahzad, 11. Manjula GurugeWatch out forIn most of their games in this World Cup, West Indies have needed their middle order to string together partnerships to prop up the team's total, and Lendl Simmons has been in the thick of it. He has looked the most assured of all the batsmen and he has made the most of his chances coming in at No. 6, even though the feeling is he should have batted higher in the order.Among the Associates, Shaiman Anwar has led the charts for batsmen with over 300 runs, scoring against every opposition including a century against Ireland. His 62 against his nation of birth, Pakistan contained some eye-catching strokeplay and he would look to do a repeat of his performances against the West Indies in his team's last game of the competition.Quotes"They are very unpredictable and rely heavily on Chris Gayle.
