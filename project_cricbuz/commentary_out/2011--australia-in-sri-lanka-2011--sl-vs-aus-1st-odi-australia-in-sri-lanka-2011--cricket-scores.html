We are all set for the 1st ball to be bowledRumesh Ratnayake: When I was in the ACC, it was more of the development work, but I learnt a lot while teaching those nationss. I am priveliged to be the coach of this SL team. My main concern is with regards to fast bowlers, but I hope to get some more talents into it. There is a lot of promise in this team and I am happy with the fighting effort shown by the boys. I am sure Australia will come back hard at us in the One Day series, but we are prepared for it.Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Ajantha Mendis, Suraj Randiv, Suranga LakmalAustralia (Playing XI): Brad Haddin(w), Shane Watson, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke(c), Michael Hussey, David Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Xavier Doherty, Doug BollingerMichael Hussey: I have not played a lot in Sri Lanka, but I am looking forward to it. This is a new challenge with conditions very different to those back home. We are up for it and there are no excuses on our part. Our middle order found it going tough against the spinners, and we should not repeat the previous mistakes. I had a nice break and looking forward to the new challenge.Pitch Report: The surface looks very dry and there should be help for the spinners. The wicket will get harder to bat on as the match progresses. This is the 4th match on this ground and there have been big scores on this surface. The team batting first will be at an advantage, reckons Russell Arnold.Dilshan: The pitch looks good and we will look to put in a good show with the bat. We are going into the match with a 2 pace and 2 spin attack. 250+ should be a good score. Our fielding has been great so far and we will look to continue with our exploits.Clarke: We should back ourselves. 250 should be a good score to chase. We are confident about our prospects and we are looking forward to the game. Hastings is the unfortunate man to miss out.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batHello all, and welcome to the 1st ODI between Sri Lanka and Australia from Pallekere, Kandy. Australia were left clueless against spin in the 2 T20I's at the start of the tour. Sri Lanka resorted to five spinners in the second T20 and it paid rich dividents with Mendis registering the best ever bowling figures in a T20 international with 6/16. The Aussies need to put together a better performance as they are up against a trial by spin. Australia will be bolstered by the presence of their former skipper Ricky Ponting, skipper Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey. Do stay tuned for the toss and team updates..Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Chamara Silva, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Rangana Herath, Suraj Randiv, Nuwan Kulasekara, Shaminda Eranga, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Thissara Perera, Lasith MalingaAustralia (From): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke(c), Michael Hussey, Shaun Marsh, David Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, John Hastings, James Pattinson, Doug Bollinger, Xavier DohertyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
