Two slips in place..The South Africans will surely be thinking that this is a reasonable score for them to chase down, but they can't afford to take it lightly, especially after the way they played in the last game. The run-chase will come your way in around 35-40 minutes from now. Stay tuned...England have been bowled out once again. After de Villiers opted to bowl first in overcast conditions, it was Tahir who surprised everyone by taking Roy's wicket in his very first over (5th over of the innings). Hales continued his good run of form and was being well supported by Root, until the time he got trapped plumb in front by Tahir. Morgan's poor run continued, while Hales-Stokes partnership provided hopes of a big score when they were out in the middle. However, the departure of Stokes opened the gates as wickets kept tumbling thereafter. In the end, Hales managed to register his second century in the 50-over format, but England were bowled out soon after, managing just 236 in the end.4

The flipper from Tahir, Root kneels down to sweep but the ball misses the blade and strikes him on the pad right in front of the middle stump. Looked extremely close with the naked eye and Tahir knew it. It was crashing right into the middle stump. Despite the umpire giving it as not out, Tahir ensured that AB de Villiers used his review and well, that has paid dividends for the visitors. So, Root won't become the first Englishman to score three ODI hundreds in a row, at least not this time. Root lbw b Tahir 27(25) [4s-4]Tahir to Root, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Tahir is absolutely sure about this lbw appeal. The onfield call is not out but AB de Villiers reviews because his bowler was adamant. Tahir's front foot is fine. This looks very close. No bat involved as UltraEdge shows nothing. Hawk-Eye shows that the ball is crashing into the middle stump and the onfield decision will be overturned. Umpire Cloete's decision has been overturned for the second time in this match already.

AB de Villiers has a few words to say to his troops before they break out of the huddle. Out come the English openers.Morgan: We wanted to bowl. Not that disappointed batting first as well. We are unchanged for this game. I think we put in a poor performance. We had a lot of opportunities, we should have won the game but we need to show character today to win the game and the series. We have to be fearless today. Haven't played here in years and I think the scores have been lower than the other grounds. Hopefully, we can put up a good total.de Villiers: We will bowl first. Nice little cloud cover here today. We want to get some wickets early on and chase it. We want to play according to the conditions and we feel that chasing is the best way forward in this game. Rossouw comes in for Duminy. It's nice to have David Wiese and 7 and Chris Morris at 8. Hopefully, we can play the perfect game. We are confident as a team at the moment and we want to win this series. It's a great setup in Newlands today. Big game for both the teams, it's like it's 0-0.So, South Africa have made one change - Rossouw replaces Duminy, while England are unchanged.Teams:England (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Stuart Broad, Reece TopleySouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Rilee Rossouw, Farhaan Behardien, David Wiese, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Imran TahirSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to fieldThere was a bit of drizzle in the morning and the conditions are a little overcast at the moment in Cape Town. The good news is that we are scheduled to start right on time. Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that rain doesn't spoil what promises to be another cracker of a contest. The toss and the teams are not far away. Stay tuned.Joe Root has been in sensational form for the visitors, scoring two fantastic centuries in the last two games. Unfortunately for England, both of them have come in losing causes and Eoin Morgan's men will either be wishing for Root to not score a ton today or hoping that the luck favours them the third time around. Jokes apart, Root has been the backbone of this English batting order and they will be hoping that their star batsman comes good once again. South Africa have the momentum with them, but it all comes down to nothing if they can't win the game today. An ODI series-win will be a big boost to their confidence before the T20Is.At 210/8 in the last ODI, South Africa were staring at another series defeat, until Chris Morris decided to take matters into his own hands. His counter-attack was fierce and just when England looked like sealing the series, his magnificent 38-ball 62 took the game away from England's grasp. Even though he perished when the Proteas needed just a solitary run to win, Imran Tahir ensured that going into the final game, the series was tied at 2-2. Hello and a warm welcome to the fifth and final ODI between South Africa and England. I am Sidhant Maheshwari and I will bring you all the action from the first innings of this game.Preview:A series that we thought might have been sealed on Friday (February 12) was given a lifeline as the two sides will lock horns again on Sunday (February 14) in the decider, less than 48 hours after the thriller at Johannesburg. Clearly, the momentum is with the home side after they fought back from being 2-0 down to level it 2-2.Chris Morris was the hero in the fourth One-Day International (ODI) as he sealed a win from a very tough situation for the Proteas. But England skipper Eoin Morgan believes that the tense finish could actually help his team going forward."We have a very young squad and the more games that we play in that are nail-biters like this the better the side will become because of it," Morgan said after the loss."I think producing performances under pressure for young guys is a must going into international tournaments. It was great that it was a nail-biter, but disappointing to lose."Indeed, it would have been disappointing for England and even more so for Joe Root as he scored two top-class centuries in losing causes. South Africa will have to stop him to put more pressure on skipper Morgan who hasn't registered even a single 30-plus score this series.But Ben Stokes would relish coming back to the ground where he smashed 258 last month in the drawn Test. If we do get a similar pitch, then we are in for a run-fest. England will also want to put up an improved fielding performance as they dropped a few catches in the last game.Stuart Broad, who made a comeback to ODI cricket after nearly 12 months, started off with a bang but quickly faded away. He will in all likelihood get another game ahead of David Willey.For South Africa, the middle order is one area of concern as Farhan Behardien and JP Duminy haven't put up big scores yet. But they might stick with them for one more game given David Miller has not played even a single game this series.David Wiese is expected to get an extended run ahead of Morne Morkel, given the latter has not been picked for the T20 series or the World Cup next month.Teams:England (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Stuart Broad, Reece Topley, James Taylor, Jonny Bairstow, David Willey, Chris Jordan, Liam PlunkettSouth Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, David Wiese, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Rilee Rossouw, Morne Morkel, Marchant de LangeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
