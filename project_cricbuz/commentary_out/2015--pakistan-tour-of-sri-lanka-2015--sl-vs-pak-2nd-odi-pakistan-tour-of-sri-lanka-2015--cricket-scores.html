Irfan will open the attackAzhar Ali had his team in a huddle and had a few words before they took the field. Dilshan and Kusal Perera are already at the crease. It is the latter who will take strike first up. Irfan marks his run-up. Two slips and a short leg in place. Off we go...Hello again.. There was a slight drizzle as the Pakistani innings ended. However, it is clear at the moment and the chase will resume on time. The highest successful run-chase at Pallekele is 240. Sri Lanka have to bat well to overhaul the target. Can they do so and level the series? Or will Pakistan bowlers defend the total and go 2-0 up? Answers coming up as the players make their way out to the centre.For the hosts, Angelo Mathews bowled a fine spell up front. However, the rest of the bowlers largely struggled with their control. Lasith Malinga picked up wickets with his variations, but was expensive. To make matters worse, Sri Lanka also dropped a slew of catches. Earlier, due to rain, the start was delayed by 30 minutes, but overs weren't reduced. Under lights, it may do a bit for Pakistan's seamers and the hosts have a task on their hands as they look to chase down the target and level the series 1-1.Azhar Ali's well-constructed fifty helped Pakistan to notch up a very good total. Shoaib Malik, played a breezy knock in the middle overs to keep the scorecard ticking. He went on to amass a fifty as well. Mohammad Rizwan's handy blows in the slog overs, then lifted the visitors to a challenging score. The youngster showed good improvisation.4

For now the entire ground is still covered. We have news that the game will start at 15:00 local time. No reduction in overs.14:23 Local Time, 08:53 GMT, 14:23 IST: The rain isn't that heavy now and the breeze has picked up. So hopefully we can have a full game.14:12 Local Time, 08:42 GMT, 14:12 IST: Unfortunately, it has started to rain and the groundstaff are out with the covers.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Anwar Ali, Yasir Shah, Rahat Ali, Mohammad IrfanSri Lanka (Playing XI): Kusal Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Upul Tharanga, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal(w), Sachith Pathirana, Thisara Perera, Milinda Siriwardana, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan PradeepAngelo Mathews: "I've got no control at all over the toss. He calls it right all the time. I would have batted first as well. We have a couple of changes. Suranga Lakmal and Seekkuge Prasanna are out, Sachith Pathirana is making his debut, Nuwan Pradeep is also in. The batters got starts in the last game, but really didn't convert them. Also the bowlers need to do better. It's a happy hunting ground for him (Dilshan), hopefully he'll score runs today."Azhar Ali: "We are going to bat first. It looks a decent track and we would like to put runs on the board. I think he (Hafeez) is keeping things very simple and he's very confident that he'll clear the test (talking about Hafeez awaiting the test results on his bowling action). We discussed a few things that we could have done better in the first game. We won the first game, but we know they are a good side at home."Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batThere is news coming in that Sri Lanka have a debutant in Sachith Pathirana. Nuwan Pradeep is also expected to take the field.Pitch Report: "It (the pitch) looks nice and hard, there are a few cracks but I don't think they will come into play. It will stay the same throughout the game, so the toss really doesn't matter. I think there are a lot of runs to be had. It might move around a bit under lights in the evening. It is a bit cloudy but I'd say take that out of the mind, win the toss and bat first," reckons Russel Arnold.13:40 Local Time, 08:10 GMT, 13:40 IST: It is partly cloudy out there and the players are seen warming up.Sri Lanka perhaps will look to change their bowling combination. There is a chance that Senanayake will play. On the other hand, Pakistan are expected to remain unchanged. Unfortunately, showers are forecast for today. Fingers crossed that we will get a full game.Welcome to the second ODI between Sri Lanka and Pakistan at Pallekele. In the first game, on the back of Mohammad Hafeez's superb all-round performance with both bat and ball, Pakistan registered a convincing win. He picked up four wickets and then went on to post a well-constructed hundred. The experienced, Shoaib Malik, too, played with a calm head on his shoulders. For the hosts, Chandimal was the top-scorer, but their bowlers struggled to make their mark. Even their spearhead, Lasith Malinga was below par.PreviewAfter a thumping victory thanks to an all-round show from Mohammad Hafeez, Pakistan will start as favorites in the 2nd ODI against Sri Lanka at Pallekele. The visitors have the momentum after breezing to victory in the first of the five-match series. Azhar Ali's men have little to worry about in terms of team combinations but in stark contrast, hosts Sri Lanka will be pondering a number of issues as they look to draw level. There is some rain predicted on Wednesday and the weather could influence the decision of both teams while forming the final eleven as well as the strategies required to tackle the conditions. The seamers are bound to get assistance under the floodlights in the second-half of the game but the prevailing weather conditions mean that teams would prefer chasing keeping the Duckworth-Lewis system in mind.Date: 15th July 2015Venue: Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, PallekeleTime: 14:30 PM Local TimeTeam newsSri LankaNot a lot went right for Angelo Mathews' men in the first ODI. Their top order was guilty of not carrying on after getting off to starts. They still managed a respectable total thanks to Dinesh Chandimal's half-century. Batting remains Sri Lanka's greater strength at the moment and they will need a much better show from their senior players to get into a position of strength and ease the pressure of the bowling attack. The combinations might be tinkered with to fit in a more experienced spinner in Sachitra Senanayake. The pacers will have to pull up their socks and the leader of the attack Lasith Malinga will be under the spotlight to guide the younger members. His form will be crucial to the fortunes of Sri Lanka.Probable XI: Kusal Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Upul Tharanga, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Milinda Siriwardana, Sachitra Senanayake, Lasith Malinga, Suranga LakmalPakistanAzhar Ali's men need a comprehensive series win to try and qualify for the Champions Trophy.
