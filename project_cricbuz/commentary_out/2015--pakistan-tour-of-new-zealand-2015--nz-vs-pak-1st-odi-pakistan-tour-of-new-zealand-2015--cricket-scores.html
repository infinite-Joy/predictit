Irfan will open the attackIrfan to start off with two slips in place.Riding on fifties from Misbah and Afridi, Pakistan have got a reasonable score on the board. At 127/6, things weren't looking great for the visitors, but Afridi played aggressively and scored a 29-ball 67 to give the Pakistani bowlers something to bowl at. Captain Misbah too played extremely well for his fifty, but the rest of the batsmen threw their wickets away. Elliott bagged three wickets, while Boult, Mills and Anderson picked up two each. The pitch is still good to bat on. However, we saw in the 7th ODI against Sri Lanka that the ball swung around a bit in the evening at this venue. Take a break and be right back here for New Zealand's reply.4
