Guptill is on strike. Finn will open the attackHello again. New Zealand have their task cut out. With the brand of cricket they are playing, we can expect them to come hard at this target. Guptill and Baz are out in the middle. England take the field after a small huddle. Finn has the new ball in his hand. He has couple of slips in place....Buttler: "It was a great start for us. Right throughout the innings it was fantastic. It was how we wanted to play. It's a good wicket. It will be tough to defend and we'll have to bowl well as well. This knock boosts my confidence. It was really pleasing for us. Now we need to take wickets and win this game."At that stage it looked like New Zealand will be able to contain the Englishmen for a below par total, but Rashid walked out and along with Buttler, both batsmen took the sails out of the Kiwi attack. Both of them played without any fear and kept finding the gaps, while the Black Caps bowlers kept banging it short. Both of them put on 177 for the 7th wicket, a record in ODIs, with Buttler cracking his second ODI ton off just 66 balls. He now owns the record for the fastest and the second fastest ODI hundred by an Englishman. Rashid too continued to play his shots, reaching his maiden ODI fifty in the process as well. Even though both Buttler and Rashid went trying to up the ante, two lusty blows from Plunkett saw England going past 400, their highest total in ODI history.Root continued to play aggressively and soon reached his 5th ODI ton, that too off just 71 balls, making it the 3rd fastest ton by an Englishman at that time. Root though soon edged one off Boult and that opened the floodgates for New Zealand. After being 171/2 at one stage, England were stuttering at 202/6, when the debutant, Sam Billings was given out lbw on review.England got off to the worst start possible, losing Jason Roy off the first ball of the innings. However, that didn't deter Hales and Root from playing their shots as both put on a 50-run stand before Hales top-edged a pull to Henry.

ENGLAND:6.2 Nathan McCullum to J Root, 1 run, flatter and on the stumps, Root goes deep in the crease and works it in front of square on the leg-side

ENGLAND:5.6 Boult to Hales, no run, good length delivery outside off stump, driven to cover-point
ENGLAND:5.5 Boult to Hales, no run, inside edge onto the pad, could have easily dragged that back onto the sticks. Hales is trying to cut ones that aren't all that short and he gets away with another one
ENGLAND:5.4 Boult to Hales, FOUR, edged but there is no one at third slip. Good length delivery outside off stump, Hales looks to cut, it wasn't all that short, gets a thick edge that flies past the man at first slip, Elliott gives chase at third man but loses the race
ENGLAND:5.3 Boult to Hales, no run, poor ball but Boult gets away with it, short and wide, probably would have been a wide but he opted to reach out and cut, only to find cover-point

ENGLAND:2.4 Boult to J Root, no run, good length delivery on the stumps, blocked towards mid-on
ENGLAND:2.3 Boult to J Root, FOUR, driven off the back foot, again a big gap at cover and Root timed that to perfection. Interestingly, Boult tried the scrambled seam delivery, but it didn't work as the length was too short
ENGLAND:2.2 Boult to J Root, no run, full and asking Root to drive/play away from the body, but the batsman lets it go
ENGLAND:2.1 Boult to J Root, no run, not much of swing on this short of length delivery, just goes across the right-hander with the angle from over the wicket, Root lifts his bat and lets it go

ENGLAND:0.6 Boult to Hales, 3 runs, full and swinging back in, Hales drives it along the ground through mid-off, Baz was very square, but he gives chase, oh he's racing after that and puts in anexcellent dive to pull it back just inside the rope. Great effort that from the New Zealand skipper
ENGLAND:0.5 Boult to J Root, 1 run, oh Root almost hit that to the fielder there. Inswinger on a good length, Root tries to work it on the on-side, plays very late, doesn't control the shot and hits it uppishly, Santner dives to his left at leg gully, but it evades himThere is man at leg slip
ENGLAND:0.4 Boult to J Root, 2 runs, too full and on the pads, Root flicks it behind square on the on-side for a couple of runs

ENGLAND:0.1 Boult to Jason Roy, out Caught by Guptill!! Oh dear! What a poor start for Jason Roy and he can't believe what he's done. With just mid-off and point in front of square on the off-side, Roy has picked out the latter. Nothing but a gentle inswinger on a fuller length, on seeing that big gap at cover, Roy wanted to send the drive off the front foot through that region, but he hit it much more squarer and Guptill dived forward to complete a low catch. A golden duck for Roy. Jason Roy c Guptill b Boult 0(1)Boult to Jason Roy, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Jason Roy and Hales are at the crease. Jason Roy is on strike. Boult will open the attackIt's time for the action to begin. Alex Hales and Jason Roy make their way out to the middle. How many slips will Baz have for his new ball bowlers? He had at least three and sometimes four during the World Cup. Trent Boult to open the attack and he has only two slips in place.New Zealand have rested Tim Southee for this game, while Corey Anderson, who missed the second Test, is yet to fully recover from a back injury.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent BoultEngland (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, Liam Plunkett, Steven FinnMorgan: "The last year or so has been really poor, but the future looks promising with a few young guys coming in. The group of players that we have picked can play the brand of cricket that we want to play moving forward. Sam Billings is making his debut, he is an exciting player and he's going to be very good to watch in the middle-order."McCullum: "We are going to bowl first. The conditions are overcast, hopefully our boys can swing it early on and take some early wickets. Mitchell Santner is making his debut. This wicket looks great. I think overall our philosophy is still very much about playing a positive brand of cricket. The World Cup was outstanding for us. Now we've got an opportunity to continue the good work."New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to fieldIt's toss time folks!Although England are playing at home, the pressure is slightly more on them to put up an improved show in the 50-over format after a disastrous World Cup campaign. Team vice-captain and wicket-keeper Jos Buttler has asked his mates to play 'no-fear-cricket', while interim coach Paul Farbrace has said that the side needs to play with freedom in the 5-match ODI series. England have had a decent build-up to the series as a few of the players did well in the Natwest T20 Blast. However, they are not fielding a full strength squad as the likes of James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Ian Bell and Moeen Ali have been rested for the series.England then made a few changes to their coaching staff, drew the Test series against West Indies, Andrew Strauss was appointed the new ECB director and then England played a hard-fought Test series against New Zealand in which they shared honours. After the conclusion of the Test series, McCullum said "1-1 was a fair reflection." New Zealand played a warm-up match against Leicestershire to practice for the ODI series, in which Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott and Luke Ronchi played aggressively. Taylor, who has not been in the best of forms of late, has hinted that he would make a conscious effort to be more positive with the bat.The last time these two sides met in an ODI, Tim Southee picked up a record 7-wicket haul, while Brendon McCullum scored a breezy fifty. Yes, it was at the 2015 World Cup that New Zealand thrashed England at the Cake Tin in a game that lasted a total of just 45.4 overs. A lot has happened since then. McCullum continued to bludgeon bowling attacks at the top throughout the World Cup and then continued his show in the IPL as well. New Zealand had an excellent time at the multi-nation event, barring the final, while England failed to make it to the quarter-finals.Preview:After his team were thrashed by Australia in the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on March 29, New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum was asked by a reporter if he and his team would change the aggressive brand of cricket that had taken them to their maiden tournament final, built on a stunning winning streak of ten matches.His reply came fast, without hesitation. "No, no, you don't change your style of play," said McCullum with the same seriousness and conviction with which he had rolled up to every press conference during a memorable World Cup campaign. "For us to develop into the team that we want to be in international cricket, we have to play like that. I think there's an element of fearlessness about how we play, which has been an effect on other teams, as well, and I think if you ask most of the teams in this tournament what they think of how we've played the game, they would be very respectful of how we've gone about it."It's what gives us our greatest pleasure, as well, and sometimes we're going to come undone, but for us to compete against the big teams on regular occasions and for us to be able to develop into the team we want to be, we need to keep playing this brand of cricket, and we'll get better at doing it the more we become accustomed to it, and I guess a stronger depth of players we develop in the same sort of mould of cricket as we have. So yeah, we're not going to change."That attacking, joyous brand of cricket was extended in the Test arena recently. New Zealand owned much of the first Test at Lord's by playing aggressive cricket, and it was during one such attacking passage that they let the match slip. But McCullum's men stuck to that same approach at Leeds and it earned them a 1-1 series scoreline to extend their unbeaten run further. Now, they will ditch the whites to don black, the colour they wore so passionately during the World Cup. The format in which they bossed opposing teams in the World Cup until the final, the format in which they are ranked third, the format in which they have the best chance to keep winning. England have reason to be worried. Very worried.A run of ten unbeaten ODIs ended at the MCG on March 29, when a ruthless Australia shoved them aside for a fifth World Cup title. After two Tests against England, the Black Caps warmed up for the limited-overs leg of their tour with a 198-run hammering of Leicestershire on Friday. In that 50-over fixture, the tourists were in a spot of bother at 152 for 5 but surged to 373 without further loss through a superb partnership of 221 in just 25 overs from centurions Grant Elliott and Luke Ronchi.Elliott is, of course, the allrounder who shone during that unforgettable World Cup semi-final at Eden Park on March 24, hitting the winning runs in a nail-biting chase over South Africa to spark scenes of delirium. Elliott followed that special innings with a brisk half-century in the final, the only innings of note from a limp New Zealand display. Now, as New Zealand and England begin a five-match series with the first ODI at Birmingham on June 9 (Tuesday), the likes of Elliott - not part of the Test squad - will hope to reproduce such batting form as the Black Caps get back to their strongest suite against a team which put up its most tepid World Cup campaign ever.From the XI that played the World Cup final at the MCG, the most likely change will be Nathan McCullum coming in for the retired Daniel Vettori. Corey Anderson's back is being closely monitored, so should he not be passed fit then the spin-bowling allrounder Mitchell Santner could get a debut. With left-arm quick Mitchell McClenaghan joining the touring party from a successful IPL season of winners Mumbai Indians, then taking four wickets against Leicestershire, New Zealand's bowling has added zing. Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Matt Henry bowled a lot of overs during the Tests and so having a fresh McClenaghan could be the way the team management tilts.Eoin Morgan's England have lost seven of 11 ODIs this year, sitting at sixth on the ICC's list for ODI teams. The new selection panel dumped regulars James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Ian Bell and Gary Ballance while resting Moeen Ali, opting to bring in some fresh faces. There are some aggressive hitters in the new squad, but how they fare against a superb New Zealand bowling attack remains to be seen. It will not be easy.During the World Cup, McCullum's Black Caps set the bar for all ODI teams apart from Australia. If they replicate that exciting and aggressive brand across the next two weeks, they should comfortably add another ODI series and a one-off Twenty20 international to their burgeoning kitty. So sit back and get ready to enjoy the ride.Teams:England (From): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Taylor, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, Mark Wood, Steven Finn, Liam Plunkett, Sam Billings, David WilleyNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, Grant Elliott, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent Boult, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Mitchell Santner, Ben WheelerLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
