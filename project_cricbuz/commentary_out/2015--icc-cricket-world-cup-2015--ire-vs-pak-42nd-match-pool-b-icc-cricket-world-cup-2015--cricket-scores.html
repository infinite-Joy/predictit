Ahmed Shehzad is on strike. Cusack will open the attackTwo slips in place for Cusack..Welcome back.. Can Pakistan chase down 238? Or will Ireland do a repeat of 2007 and bundle Pakistan out of the tournament? A Q/F spot is up for grabs for both teams..The Pakistanis bowled decent lines and lengths, but they dropped way too many chances. If they had taken those chances, the Irish innings would have ended prematurely. Riaz ended with 3 wickets, while Rahat Ali and Sohail Khan picked up 2 wickets each. They were well supported by Adil and Haris Sohail, who also took a wicket each. It should be an interesting run-chase. Let's see how the Pakistanis fare when they come out to bat. Join us in a short while to find out.Meanwhile, Porterfield got to his 7th ODI century and his first of the World Cups, but he also perished while trying to accelerate during the batting powerplay. Ireland though failed to get going as they kept losing wickets. From 182/4 in the 39th over, Ireland slipped to 216/8 in the 48th over. In the end, they were bowled out for 237.Niall O'Brien then came out to support his captain. He got off to a good start as he was on 12 off just 9 balls, but he threw it away as well, becoming Rahat Ali's first victim of the game. Seeing wickets fall at the other end, Porterfield went into a shell of sorts and was trying to hold one end up, instead of playing his free flowing shots. Balbirnie and Wilson also got off to starts, but threw it away when Ireland were looking to up the ante. Ireland got off to a poor start, with Stirling being adjudged lbw in the fourth over itself. Since then, Porterfield looked to give some impetus to the Irish batting as he played a few good shots. Joyce gave him good company for some time, but that was also because of the fact that he was dropped on 5. However, he failed to cash in on the reprieve and eventually got out for 11.4
IRELAND:49.6 Riaz to Dockrell, out Dockrell Run Out!! Ireland have been bowled out off the final ball of the innings. The duo tried to steal a bye, but the Pakistanis were alert to the situation.

Sohail Khan will open the attackTwo slips in place as Sohail steams in..Right, at Napier, West Indies are cruising towards the target and should go well above Pakistan in net run-rate. On the other hand, Pakistan haven't chased well in recent times and their record chasing in this tournament is 0-2. That sets up a thrilling finale to the group stages of the World Cup. Misbah has plenty to say at the team huddle and we're ready for the contest.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Ahmed Shehzad, Haris Sohail, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Sohail Khan, Rahat Ali, Ehsan AdilIreland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, Stuart Thompson, Alex Cusack, George DockrellIreland have won the toss and have opted to batMisbah-ul-Haq: We don't need to think that way (about pressure), we need to just go there and express ourselves, be positive and try to and give our 100%, rest nobody can control that. It's always a very good pitch to bat on, bowling really needs to be on target. Very unfortunate for us, Irfan is not playing due to injury concerns, Younis Khan is also not playing and Haris Sohail is back from injury, so he is in the side.William Porterfield: It's like any other occasion. We needed to be prepared very well for the game which we have done and take it as another game where we can get 2 points from and obviously those two points take us to the next phase, so it's a big game in that sense, but as long we set the process well, we will be happy. It does very much so, the way we have played in the competition, we are very happy with that, the freedom and confidence we have played with - we will have to bring it today as well. We will bat first, looks like a very good pitch, you can't assess that from too early on. The scores have been quite high in this competition, but we need to get out there and set the platform first, and if we have got wickets in hand, coming at the back end, anything is possible. It's obviously one of their strengths (bowling), we need to start very well with the bat, get to the first 10-12 overs and set it up for the back end. The way we have done that so far has been very pleasing, we have to just go out there and do that again. We have got the same team that played against India.Weather Update: It's going to be a partly cloudy day and with not much of a chance for rain to disturb proceedings. Should be pretty ideal playing conditions.So what's going on in Napier - By the looks of it, West Indies are coasting towards a comprehensive victory over UAE. They will, in all possibility, finish with 6 points and with a better net run-rate than Pakistan. The equation then is simple - Win and go through to the Q/Fs, lose and get eliminated Ireland's bowling has been their weakness but there's no quick stitch as yet. The young off-spinner, Andy McBrine might be back though - replacing Stuart Thompson.Team News: Pakistan's four-pronged pace attack is working wonders and Misbah has already hinted at going with an unchanged line-up. That will leave Yasir Shah warming the benches once again. Haris Sohail missed the match against South Africa with an injury. If he does make his way back, one of Sohaib Maqsood or Umar Akmal might have to give way.Head-to-Head Record: After the reversal in 2007, Pakistan has held its own against Ireland and enjoys a 3-1 winning advantage. The last two matches, played in May 2013, were extremely close though with one match ending in a tie and Pakistan scraping through the other, by a slender 2-wicket margin.Pitch Conditions: With short square boundaries and a pitch that's rock hard, Adelaide has been the usual batting paradise. Two matches have been played here and the team batting first has held the advantage. Pakistan played their first World Cup match, against India, on this ground and should have first-hand knowledge of the conditions.The 2007 result is fresh in their memories and the new generation of players isn't worried about playing to the galleries. "I watched that match on the telly. I was in school. Obviously, that was a starting point in Irish cricket. It was a great day," middle-order batsman, Andrew Balbirnie said. While the youngsters are brash and confident, the older guard has mixed optimism with caution. "It's just another game of the group in terms of preparation," skipper William Porterfield told reporters during the pre-match press conference. "Obviously result-wise it's a key match, but you are still going to prepare like you do for each match," he added.On the other hand, Ireland have been steady. After two wins - against West Indies and UAE - reality hit them during a massive defeat against South Africa. The game against Zimbabwe was a cliff-hanger and John Mooney's controversial catch turned out to be the difference between the two teams. It was followed by another walloping at the hands of the Indians. Having come pretty far, Ireland have nothing to lose and this might work in their favour when they meet Pakistan.So what's the team talk - Pakistan look relaxed after having recorded three wins in a row. While the victories over Zimbabwe and UAE were amongst expected lines, it was the stunning defeat of South Africa that has alarmed its rivals. The cornered tigers - as Imran Khans men were famously known during the 1992 siege - have enveloped this team as well. Can they continue the upward revival? The players certainly think so. "We are playing for the pride of 18 crore Pakistanis who are looking at us. We must not give ourselves the chance to regret later that we did not leave any stone unturned, Misbah said, asking his players to rise to the occasion.There's another possibility. A surprise West Indies loss, a tie or a no-result will see both teams go through to the quarter-finals, irrespective of the result of this match.Ireland also have 6 points, but their net run-rate is the worst amongst the three teams vying for the final two spots. A straightforward victory will ensure them a place in the quarter-final, but a loss, doubled with West Indies' victory over UAE, earlier in the day in Napier, will see them eliminated from the tournament.Qualification Scenarios: Before going any further, let's have a look at what this game means to both teams in terms of qualification scenarios. With 6 points and a superior net run-rate, Pakistan are best placed to qualify. A win will take them through as the third placed team in Pool B but a loss will complicate things for Misbah-ul-Haq's men. They can still make it to the next round, provided they have a better net run-rate than West Indies - even if the Caribbean team defeats UAE.Cut back to 2015 and the two teams are once again locked in a do-or-die battle. The scene might have moved from Jamaica to Adelaide, but the hunger remains. On the eve of the match, Pakistan middle-order batsman, Younis Khan, who was part of that 2007 debacle, spoke about wanting to honour the late coach with a victory at Adelaide. "Hope we can win this game and some more in the World Cup. There would be nothing better to dedicate to Bob's memory," he said.12:40 Local Time, 02:10 GMT, 07:40 IST: Eight years ago - on March 17th, 2007, Pakistan and Ireland met for the first time at the Sabina Park during the 2007 edition of the World Cup. It was a must win match for Pakistan. Fate willed otherwise though and Ireland created history. Pakistan, the 1992 champions found themselves out of the carnival even before it began. The turmoil didn't end there. A few days after their exit, coach, Bob Woolmer, died under mysterious circumstances. A nation already depressed with the on-field happenings were left with shock and numb at the untimely demise of one of the greatest coaches to have graced the game.Preview by G RajaramanThere was a distinct contrast to the buzz at the Adelaide Oval on the eve of Pakistan's match against Ireland in the ICC Cricket World Cup compared to the last time they were here for their opening game against India a month ago. Back then, hundreds of fans thronged the ground to watch the teams prepare. On Saturday, there were only a handful, almost as if the final training sessions in the league stage were being held behind closed gates.The stakes for the two teams, though, are very high. Neither has been guaranteed a spot in the quarter-finals from Group B behind India and South Africa. Pakistan could do the West Indies a favour with a victory over Ireland on Sunday but if Ireland secure another famous win, they would be shutting the door on one of these two big teams. The West Indies will face the United Arab Emirates in Napier and will be hoping for two outcomes in their favour.There will be a great temptation to simplify Sunday's match as a contest between Pakistan's bowlers and Ireland's batsmen but that must be resisted. On what could turn out to be a batting track, the other battle between Ireland's bowlers and Pakistan's batsmen may have a more direct bearing on the outcome. There is no doubt that Pakistan's batsmen have not come to the party but the Irish bowling does not have one strong performance to show.Pakistan are hoping that the presence of Sarfraz Ahmed, however belated, at the top will breathe life into their campaign. Having sat out of the first four games, Sarfraz Ahmed made a quickfire 49 against South Africa. That innings could be the catalyst which would help the other batsmen discover their mojo in the crucial match. Even if he has not set the Torrens River on fire, skipper Misbah-ul-Haq is the only one who has scored more than 200 runs.Pakistan's aggressive pace bowling options have helped paper cracks in the batting department. Wahab Riaz (11 wickets), Sohail Khan (9) and Mohammad Irfan (8) have been bolstered in the last three games by the addition of Rahat Ali (5) to the attack. They are not so overly concerned by the failure of their spinners to take wickets but are relieved that Shahid Afridi has been quite inexpensive.Pakistan's awareness of Ireland's mature batting line-up borders on respect for their competence against spin bowling and that could lead them to not considering the claims of leg-spinner Yasir Shah. After an intensive workout, the fast bowlers spent some time squatting beyond the square, listening to bowling consultant Mushtaq Ahmed and enjoying one another's company. The four of them have won the respect of the skipper, who is seeking to pile pressure on the rivals with frequent wickets.That is exactly what Ireland's batting will try and prevent on Sunday. With the experience of skipper William Porterfield, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien and Kevin O'Brien at the top and with the youthful enterprise of Andrew Balbirnie at their disposal, Ireland will be hoping that they can bank on their batting to pull the rug from under Pakistan's feet, even if their own bowling has been distinctly docile.Misbah-ul-Haq knows that while his team is in a similar situation to the Wounded Tigers, as Imran Khans team of 1992 has now come to be referred to, his own team cannot sit back and say that history will repeat itself. Similarly, Porterfield is well aware that his squad may draw inspiration from Ireland's win against Pakistan in the 2007 World Cup but will have to turn up at the park with their 'A' game if they are to realise their dream of making it to the round of eight at the expense of one of the heavyweights.Indeed, history has no bearing on what happens on the park on Sunday.Teams:Pakistan (From): Sarfraz Ahmed(k), Ahmed Shehzad, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Sohail Khan, Rahat Ali, Mohammad Irfan, Ehsan Adil, Yasir Shah, Haris Sohail, Nasir JamshedIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(k), Kevin O'Brien, Stuart Thompson, John Mooney, George Dockrell, Alex Cusack, Andy McBrine, Max Sorensen, Peter Chase, Craig YoungLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
