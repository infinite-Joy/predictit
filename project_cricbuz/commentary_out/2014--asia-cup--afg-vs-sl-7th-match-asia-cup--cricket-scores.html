Nabi's soliders assemble in full force. We are all geared up for the first ball of game 7 of the Asia Cup.The teams are lining up for the national anthems. Can the spirited Afghan's surmount tremendous odds again to continue their romance? Their maiden win against a test playing nation in Bangladesh saw them meet the criteria to enter the ICC ODI rankings table. The challenge only gets stiffer against the likes of Sanga, Malinga and Mendis.Teams:Afghanistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Shahzad(w), Noor Ali Zadran, Asghar Stanikzai, Nawroz Mangal, Mohammad Nabi(c), Samiullah Shenwari, Najibullah Zadran, Mirwais Ashraf, Dawlat Zadran, Shapoor Zadran, Hamza HotakSri Lanka (Playing XI): Kushal Janith Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Chaturanga de Silva, Lasith Malinga, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha MendisNabi: 'There was a big celebration after the last match. We will try to win this game and continue the celebration. I would have also batted first. I guess, 250 will be a good score here. We have two changes. Noor Ali and Dawlat Zadran come in for Karim Sadiq and Hamid Hassan.'Mathews: 'I will have to bat first. The wicket looks slow and dry. We are not taking it easy. We cannot take them lightly. Afghanistan showed what they can do. Lakmal is playing today (Senanayake is on paternal leave).'Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: Hardly any grass is present on the wicket. It is quite hard and flat. As seen yesterday, spinners will have a field day. Dew factor will come in to play later on in the evening so the team that wins the toss will be certainly looking to bowl first.The major problem Afghanistan are facing currently, apart from their inexperience, is their shoddy fielding. If they weed out the fielding lapses, they can well give Sri Lanka a run for their money. Toss and teams coming up in a few minutes. Stay tuned....Sri Lanka, on the other hand, are yet to lose a game in the series and are comfortably sitting at the top with 8 points. The only thing they must be aiming right now is to keep their unbeaten run intact. And with a settled batting line-up and a ferocious bowling attack, they will intend to breezily sail through to the finals.The Asia Cup is turning out to be a thriller, thanks to some exciting games in the last few days. Afghanistan, high on the success of defeating a Test playing nation, will be keen on replicating their performance to show that their victory was not a fluke. It is not going to be an easy task but with disciplined bowling and sensible batting, they do possess the ability to take on big teams.Preview:After springing a surprise against Bangladesh for their first victory over a Test-playing nation, Afghanistan will look to continue their flirtation with cricketing history when they take on leaders Sri Lanka in their Asia Cup match. Buoyed by their spirited effort of taming Bangladesh by 32 runs in their own den at Fatullah on Saturday, the gutsy team from the strife-torn nation would be eyeing another major upset against Sri Lanka. The minnows though would find it difficult to achieve glory against a strong Lankan team, who are comfortably placed with eight points and are yet to lose a game.Points table:With two wins and a healthy run-rate of +0.168, Sri Lanka have virtually assured themselves of a berth in the finals of Asia Cup, while Afghanistan's hopes of further progress in the tournament would depend on the outcome of the match on Monday. Afghanistan have four points from two matches with one win and a loss in their kitty.Sri Lanka:Having arrived in the country late January for a full series, Sri Lanka have been experiencing an extended taste of Bangladeshi conditions as they won the Test series 1-0, the T20Is 2-0 before a 3-0 sweep of the ODIs. The Sri Lankan batting will have the calming influence of Sangakkara, who scored a match-winning century against India while opener Thirimanne also impressed with a fluent hundred against Pakistan in their tournament opener. With the hard-hitting Kushal Perera to give Thirimanne company, Sri Lanka have a power-packed top order and the Island Nation will be hoping for them to provide a fiery start. After recovering from a finger injury, Mahela Jayawardene, who batted at number four against India, would like to get some runs under his belt after two successive failures. In Angelo Mathews, Thisara Perera and Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka have strong middle-order batsmen who are capable match-winners.In the bowling department, Sri Lanka have Lasith Malinga, who returned to form with a five-wicket haul against Pakistan in the opening game. Sachitra Senanayake and Ajantha Mendis were amongst the wickets in the match against India and the Lankans will be hoping that the spinners extend their good form. Against India, Mathews packed his side with spinners and it will be interesting to see if he continues with the same strategy against Afghanistan.Afghanistan:Afghanistan showed the stomach for a good fight against Bangladesh after stifling them for 222. A shining effort with the bat from Asghar Stanikzai (90 not out) and Samiullah Shenwari (81) took Afghanistan to 254 for 6 after being put in to bat. At one stage, they were in trouble at 90/5, but Stanikzai and Shenwari got together and added 164 from 138 balls for the sixth wicket to take Afghanistan past 250. However, the latest Asia Cup entrants cannot expect the pair to pull off something incredible like that again and will need a better effort from the top-order if they are to challenge the powerful Sri Lankan bowling lineup. They have talented batsmen in Noor Ali Zadran and Nawroz Mangal, who got off to good starts against Pakistan but could not convert it. Afghanistan will be hoping that they do a better job with the bat against Sri Lanka.Against Pakistan, it was Mirwais Ashraf and Shenwari who shined with the ball, leaving the defending champs in a lot of trouble. Mohammad Nabi was the pick of the bowlers against Bangladesh with figures of three for 44, while Shapoor Zadran and Hamid Hassan accounted for two wickets apiece. Afghanistan will hope for the bowlers to continue their good work and give Sri Lanka a good run for their money.Numbers:3: The number of runs Kumar Sangakkara requires to become only the second player after Sanath Jayasuriya with 1000 or more runs in the Asia Cup.151: The number of runs Dinesh Chandimal requires to become the 16th Sri Lankan player with 2000 or more runs in One Day Internationals.Quotes:We were here to justify our participation on this big stage and to prove to the world that we belong here. We are here to give tough times to all four members. If we can beat one of them (India and Sri Lanka) it would be a much greater achievement for us: Asghar Stanikzai.Teams:Afghanistan (From): Mohammad Shahzad(w), Karim Sadiq, Najibullah Zadran, Asghar Stanikzai, Nawroz Mangal, Mohammad Nabi(c), Samiullah Shenwari, Mirwais Ashraf, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor Zadran, Hamza Hotak, Dawlat Zadran, Noor Ali Zadran, Fazal Niazai, Rahmat ShahSri Lanka (From): Kushal Janith Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Sachithra Senanayake, Chaturanga de Silva, Thisara Perera, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Ashan Priyanjan, Suranga Lakmal, Dhammika PrasadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
