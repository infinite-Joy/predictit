Oman openers are out under blazing floodlights. Mohammad Naveed will get us under way. One slip in place. Off we go...If there was a fortune-table charted out, UAE would top that too. So many outside edges, French cuts, dropped catches and they find themselves with a score good enough to defend. This Dhaka pitch woke up under the lights and helped by some batting panic, looked difficult to bat on. Muhammad Kaleem fought through for his maiden fifty but departed just the next ball to leave UAE on a shaky ground. Mohammad Shahzad steered the UAE ship and Mohammad Usman anchored it with an intentful-and-lucky 46.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.3 Mehran Khan to Muhammad Kaleem, 1 run, glides the ball late to short third man who stops it with a dive. Looks to have dived over the ball to hurt his tummy..

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.6 Munis Ansari to Shahzad, 2 runs, that went high into the Dhaka sky...and was shelled at deep square leg. Fullish delivery, Shahzad wants to clobber it over deep mid-wicket. Kneels and swipes, gets more height than distance and the fielder drops the steepler. Keeper had almost sprinted across to the catch-drop venue. The guilty fielder could never spot the ball and the ball bounced well in front of him
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.5 Munis Ansari to Shahzad, no run, shortish and pulled in front of square, to mid-on and there's no run
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.4 Munis Ansari to Shahzad, no run, scissors back in from middle, Shahzad was back and is rapped on the pads as he looked to tickle. Outside leg and going down to hit the neighbouring set of stumps
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.3 Munis Ansari to Muhammad Kaleem, 1 run, another outside edge. We need a counter for this. The thirteenth perhaps? Looks to play it down the ground but the ball darts away, takes the outside edge and scoots to the fence
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.2 Munis Ansari to Muhammad Kaleem, FOUR, to have a slip or not to have a slip - that's the question. Some width, Kaleem throws his bat at it and the lone slipper had to be twice as tall to pouch that. Vrooms away to the third man fence
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.1 Munis Ansari to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, that's Malinga-like. Full delivery slung on the pads, Kaleem forces it back with a bat-swingMunis Ansari, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackThis pitch under lights is very responsive, like a start-up's customer service in its infancy

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.5 Sufyan Mehmood to Shahzad, no run, well, this one's just short. Full delivery on the pad, Shahzad stays put and picks it up with a clip. Mistimed and it just fell short of a mid-wicket diving forward

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.3 Sufyan Mehmood to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, loud kneeling appeal that dies down in disappointment. Fullish and darting in, hurries and raps the pads as Kaleem missed his clip. Missing the leg-stump, confirms the HawkEye
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.2 Sufyan Mehmood to Muhammad Kaleem, FOUR, a flat-footed drive through the covers attempted but ball took the 180-degree exit. Inside edge and Chinese cut past the leg-stump
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.1 Sufyan Mehmood to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, length ball on off-stump, Kaleem walks forward and defends it with a closed bat
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.6 Bilal Khan to Shahzad, no run, the slip there seemed a metre deep. Nothing ever is deep at Dhaka - not the fielders and nor the grass. Wanted to glide this ball to third man, managed it off the outside half and the ball dies well in front of the slip
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.5 Bilal Khan to Muhammad Kaleem, 1 run, fuller length delivery on middle, Kaleem tucks it to backward square leg

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.3 Bilal Khan to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, the running's a mess at the moment. Short of a length delivery, Kaleem looks to tuck it. Takes his bottom hand off as the ball overwhelms with the bounce and turns it round the corner with just the one glove. Square leg swooped in and Kaleem aborted the single
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.2 Bilal Khan to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, fullish on middle, Kaleem bends forward and bunts it back
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:2.1 Bilal Khan to Shahzad, 1 run, the throw from mid-off was looped wide of the stumps at the bowler's end. any closer and things would have been more interesting. Shahzad shimmied out and flat-batted the drive to mid-off on this occasion
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.6 Sufyan Mehmood to Shahzad, 1 run, comes down the track, twirls his wrists and gets the ball to deep mid wicket

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.3 Sufyan Mehmood to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, beaten. Full and nipping away off the track, a tentative Kaleem prodded forward but the ball grazed past the outside edgeMohammad Shahzad, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.2 Sufyan Mehmood to Rohan Mustafa, out Rohan Mustafa Run Out!! And it's an early hara-kiri. The nerves have started to show. Good intent in dancing down the track and caning the drive to mid-off but it was hit so hard that there wasn't a single on. Mustafa made the call, ran to the danger end but Aaqib rifled the throw at the bowler's end, hits the bull's eye and the batsman was found short. Rohan Mustafa run out (Aaqib Sulehri) 5(6) [4s-1]Sufyan Mehmood to Rohan Mustafa, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!Run out appeal sent upstairs...and he's short! OUT!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.1 Sufyan Mehmood to Rohan Mustafa, no run, that ripped out the toe...of the bat. Very full delivery speared on middle, Mustafa made room to swing hard over mid-wicket, is late and the wood chunk flies away. A new bat makes its way in
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.1 Sufyan Mehmood to Rohan Mustafa, no ball, shortish and wide, Mustafa flashes the cut and doesn't connect. And Sufyan Mehmood has overstepped by a marginSufyan Mehmood, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.6 Bilal Khan to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, swing-and-a-miss. A desperate shimmy down the ground to connect, doesn't and the ball swings in this time to make way through the bat-pad cave. Just about shaves the off-stump en route to the keeper
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.5 Bilal Khan to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, beaten. Like my favourite song on loop. Pitching fuller and swinging across the bat face as Kaleem looked to clip it round the cornerYes, a slip
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.4 Bilal Khan to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, angled across on a good length, stays over the wicket to the right hander too, Kaleem lifts his bat and lets it go
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.3 Bilal Khan to Rohan Mustafa, 1 run, the awayswinger not so vicious and a more compact Mustafa opens the blade to steal a single to third man
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.3 Bilal Khan to Rohan Mustafa, wide, that was dragged back a touch, still curled away in the air and perhaps just brushed the tramline. Looked harsh to me
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.2 Bilal Khan to Rohan Mustafa, FOUR, karma. You spot the swing and still don't populate the cordon. Another vicious swing as Mustafa drives, thin outside edge that runs through. Keeper dived again but can only dive so much
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.1 Bilal Khan to Rohan Mustafa, leg byes, FOUR, screamer first up. Pitched deliciously fuller on off and swung away late to beat the drive. Took the pad and evaded the keeper's desperate dive to his leftRohan Mustafa and Muhammad Kaleem are at the crease. Rohan Mustafa is on strike. Bilal Khan will open the attackThe action's about to begin. The players walk out and we have a lip-licking kebab-rivaling contest on our platter..Cannot spot a slip as Bilal Khan has the ball in his handTeams:United Arab Emirates (Playing XI): Rohan Mustafa, Muhammad Kaleem, Mohammad Shahzad, Mohammad Usman, Shaiman Anwar, Amjad Javed(c), Saqlain Haider, Swapnil Patil(w), Qadeer Ahmed, Ahmed Raza, Mohammad NaveedOman (Playing XI): Zeeshan Maqsood, Jatinder Singh, Adnan Ilyas, Aamir Kaleem, Amir Ali, Sultan Ahmed(w/c), Aaqib Sulehri, Mehran Khan, Bilal Khan, Munis Ansari, Sufyan MehmoodOman have won the toss and have opted to fieldHere's what the three surviving teams will be hoping for:UAE: A straight win to get throughOman: A big win over UAEAfghanistan: A narrow win for Oman over UAEIt's all going according to a masala script and speeding towards a Bollywood-style finish. Afghanistan won by a huge 66-run margin to stick their neck in the possible run-rate race. UAE, unbeaten so far, need a win tonight to seal a place in the main tournament. Should they lose, all three - Afghanistan, UAE and Oman - will be stranded on four points each. Superlative run-rate will then propel one to a much more celebrated stage.Teams:United Arab Emirates (From): Rohan Mustafa, Muhammad Kaleem, Shaiman Anwar, Amjad Javed(c), Mohammad Usman, Mohammad Shahzad, Usman Mushtaq, Ahmed Raza, Swapnil Patil(w), Farhan Ahmed, Mohammad Naveed, Zaheer Maqsood, Qadeer Ahmed, Saqlain Haider, Fahad TariqOman (From): Zeeshan Maqsood, Jatinder Singh, Adnan Ilyas, Aamir Kaleem, Mehran Khan, Amir Ali, Sultan Ahmed(w/c), Ajay Lalcheta, Bilal Khan, Munis Ansari, Vaibhav Wategaonkar, Aaqib Sulehri, Rajeshkumar Ranpura, Zeeshan Siddiqui, Mohammad NadeemLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
