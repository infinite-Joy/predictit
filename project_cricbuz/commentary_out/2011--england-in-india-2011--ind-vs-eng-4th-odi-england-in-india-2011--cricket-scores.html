Takes off for a quick singleParthiv Patel and Rahane are at the crease. Parthiv Patel is on strike. Bresnan will open the attackWelcome back for the chase. A target of 220 should not be that difficultFittingly Aaron leads the Indian team off the field. The story of the innings has been the fantastic debut of Aaron. 3 wickets and all clean bowled. He bowled fast and straight and knocked over the English tail. Once again the familiar story continues for England - none of their batters going on to make a big score after getting in. The spinners did their job early on and then Aaron came to the party. Should be an easy chase for India. Will England show some spine with the ball? Will Meaker - reputedly the quickest English bowler going around outshine Aaron? Answers will be known in a short while. Do join us then.4
ENGLAND:46.1  Aaron to Bresnan, out Bowled!! Aaron cleans up the England tail and that's the end of the innings. Funnily he doesn't realise that he has bowled Bresnan initially and then sees the bails on the floor and smiles. He was getting the ball to reverse in appreciably and this one holds it's line ever so slightly. Pitched on off and Bresnan played inside the line of that short of length delivery and the ball just missed the outside edge to graze the off stump. The bails fall off in slow motion. India to chase 221 to go 4-0 up. Aaron finishes with 3/24. Fab debut. Bresnan b Aaron 45(45) [4s-6] Aaron to Bresnan, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Mahendra Singh Dhoni certainly seemed impressed with Aaron after he took the last wicket. Had a smile and then a word with him. All the other Indians too rushed in and had a word. Nice to see.

ENGLAND:44.5  Aaron to Meaker, out Bowled!! Knocked im over at 140+ KMPH! Have India found a genuine fast bowler? Too early to say. But this fella has promise. Full. Fast. Straight. Reverse.

ENGLAND:44.5  Aaron to Meaker, wide, tries the slower delivery. Gets it down leg. Wide called.
ENGLAND:44.4  Aaron to Meaker, no run, Kohli at mid wicket had Bresnan scuryying back into his crease with a dive. It was swung straight to Kohli and he tried to catch Bresnan napping. Kohli missed and Bresnan got back. Then gets up, dusts himself off and has a smile at Kohli. Good to see some friendly banter between the two.
ENGLAND:44.3  Aaron to Meaker, no run, low full toss on off stump. Curving in, Meaker pushes it back with a closed face to the bowler
ENGLAND:44.2  Aaron to Bresnan, 1 run, driven to cover. Would've been tight had Raina hit at the strikers end. He didn't and they escape.
ENGLAND:44.1  Aaron to Bresnan, no run, not only can he get it to reverse in, but also take it away from the right-hander. Aaron bowls the other one which swings away from outside off. Beats Bresnan on the flashy drive.

ENGLAND:43.2  Vinay Kumar to Bresnan, FOUR!!, Vinay Kumar errs by bowling short. Fractionally short on the stumps and Bresnan shifts his weight back and pulls wide of deep square. Meaty blow. Some cheer for the English supporters who have come in to watch the game live
ENGLAND:43.1  Vinay Kumar to Bresnan, no run, kept a bit low and Bresnan had to bring his bat down in time and does so. Pushing it out to the off sideVinay Kumar [5.0-1-30-1] is back into the attack
ENGLAND:42.6  Aaron to Meaker, no run, full and sliding down leg. Meaker missed the flick and it bounced off the pad towards backward point. WICKET MAIDEN for Aaron and he certainly bowled well in that over.
ENGLAND:42.5  Aaron to Meaker, no run, reversing back in again. Meaker though covers the line of the ball and pushes it back to Aaron
ENGLAND:42.4  Aaron to Meaker, no run, the frustration is now showing on Meaker. Tries to pull a short of length delivery outside off and is beaten for pace. Very unconvincing from Meaker.
ENGLAND:42.3  Aaron to Meaker, no run, now beats him with a pacy seam up delivery that cuts away from outside off. Meaker slashes and misses. The ball thuds into MS' gloves.
ENGLAND:42.2  Aaron to Meaker, no run, shades of Waqar in that delivery. Reverse swing was Waqar's best friend and Aaron too produces that delivery. Tailing in late and hits Meaker on the back leg. Meaker didn't know much about the ball and it almost rolled back onto the stumps. Aaron appealed for an LBW, but that was going well down leg.Stuart Meaker, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:42.1  Aaron to Borthwick, out Bowled!! 1st ODI wicket for Aaron and hopefully from an Indian view point, many more to come. This one was bowled at 141 KMPH and snuck through the crouching Borthwick's defences. Pitched on off and kept a bit low, sneaked through and hit off stump. Immediately Raina rushes in to ruffle Aaron's hair. Borthwick b Aaron 3(7) Aaron to Borthwick, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
ENGLAND:41.6  Raina to Bresnan, no run, flicked straight to the fielder at mid wicket
ENGLAND:41.5  Raina to Bresnan, FOUR!!, Raina isn't happy with Varun. Parthiv didn't move too at short fine. It was a delicate glance to the left of Parthiv who didn't move or dive and then Aaron was watching Parthiv, didn't pick up the ball and retrieved it only after it crossed the ropes. Raina throws his hands up in frustration.
ENGLAND:41.4  Raina to Bresnan, no run, pushed back to Raina who dives to his right and stops

ENGLAND:40.5  Aaron to Bresnan, 1 run, almost yorker length on the stumps, Bresnan digs it out to long on. Aaron looks like a bowler who can bowl the full length consistently and get some reverse swing at the death. Encouraging signs for India
ENGLAND:40.4  Aaron to Bresnan, no run, another back of a length delivery on off stump, Bresnan steers with an open face towards backward point. No chance of a single again
ENGLAND:40.3  Aaron to Bresnan, no run, 139 KMPH from Aaron. Straight and fast on the stumps, Bresnan pushes to leg from the crease.

ENGLAND:39.6  Ashwin to Borthwick, no run, beaut! After the carrom ball, now gets the regulation off break going, Borthwick pushed at it and the ball ripped past the outside edge. Didn't know much about it. Borthwick all at sea. End of Ash for today!
ENGLAND:39.5  Ashwin to Borthwick, no run, LSRK picked the carrom ball on air and it is the carrom ball. Spins in and hits Borthwick high on the pad even as he played down the wrong line. Too much spin. Too high. Asnani gets it right again.Back over the wicket is Ashwin.
ENGLAND:39.4  Ashwin to Borthwick, no run, flatter and pushed through outside off, Borthwick lets it goScott Borthwick, left handed bat, comes to the creaseA slip and a gully to the debutant - Borthiwck. He plays for Durham. From round the wicket comes Ashwin.
ENGLAND:39.3  Ashwin to Samit Patel, out Caught by Virat Kohli at deep mid wicket!! Another good catch as it was coming out of the sun. Virat timing his leap to perfection to take it with both hands. Samit Patel connected well with the slog sweep, but this is a big ground and he needed to get some more on that. India continue to chip away at the wickets. Samit Patel c Virat Kohli b Ashwin 14(27) Ashwin to Samit Patel, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ENGLAND:38.5  Praveen Kumar to Bresnan, 5 wides, Horrendous ball from Praveen Kumar. Another 5 gifted runs for England. They have 10 from this over - only in terms of gifts. That would've been a wide even if there were another 10 stumps standing next to the three already there. Mahendra Singh Dhoni dived, but he needed to be Joel Garner+Tom Moody and Boyd Rankin combined to stop that. He is on the floor motionless, while Raina rushes in to have a word with Praveen Kumar. Praveen Kumar isn't impressed with himself too.
ENGLAND:38.4  Praveen Kumar to Samit Patel, 1 run, Samit Patel smacks it without much timing to long on. Again it was full and on the stumps. Again Samit Patel backed away to hit through off.

ENGLAND:38.3  Praveen Kumar to Samit Patel, 5 wides, now that's a bad ball. Samit Patel charging at Praveen Kumar and Praveen Kumar lost his rag. Errs by bowling way outside leg. Mahendra Singh Dhoni had no chance. Didn't even dive. 5 bonus runs for England
ENGLAND:38.2  Praveen Kumar to Samit Patel, no run, superb yorker. Samit Patel couldn't do much. Jammed it down even as he backed away to leg. Fine delivery that from Praveen Kumar.

Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Raina and Ashwin had a word with the umpires. Samit Patel was standing very close to the umpire and Ashwin couldn't get around to save the single. Raina came up to Samit Patel and asked him to stand a little wide, to which he retaliated back. Raina wasn't impressed and that's when Bowden stepped in. Looks like things have been sorted and we are ready to go again.

ENGLAND:36.1  Ravindra Jadeja to Bresnan, FOUR!!, no long on and no deep mid wicket and that's a safe shot. Bresnan getting forward and swinging across the line over mid wicket. Clean strike too as Bresnan picked it from the hand and smacked itRavindra Jadeja [9.0-0-35-2] is back into the attack

Ash has the ball. A slip in place.Drinks are on the field now. With England in a precarious position, they wouldn't want to take the batting power-play, but they have no other option now. It is now mandatory after this over. India would be looking to finish off the innings quickly. Maybe time for Aaron to come back and clean up the tail

ENGLAND:34.3  Virat Kohli to Samit Patel, 1 run, down leg, clipped to backward square legBairstow looked bemused after he was dismissed. Had a word with Samit Patel and seemed to be indicating that he didn't pick the ball. Or maybe he was asking Samit, how did that spin so much?

ENGLAND:34.1  Virat Kohli to Bresnan, 1 run, punched past Samit Patel and they take a single

ENGLAND:33.4  Raina to Bresnan, leg byes, 1 run, a loud shout for LBW, but that pitched outside leg and turned in to hit Bresnan on the pads. Bresnan missed the flick and Raina thought he had his man. But Asnani gets it right. Too much spin - would've gone down leg as well
ENGLAND:33.3  Raina to Bresnan, FOUR!!, another bad ball. Short and wide outside off again. Much more emphatic shot from Bresnan. Rocking back and cutting powerfully wide of backward point. 2 boundaries in three balls for Bresnan and England have suddenly taken on Raina.

ENGLAND:31.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Bairstow, out Bowled!! Peach! Bairstow had no clue about that delivery. Ravindra Jadeja certainly deserved that wicket after pinging Bairstow down in the over with tight accurate stuff. This one pitches around middle and turns across Bairstow who didn't cover the line of the ball nor did he thrust his front pad out as a second form of defence. The ball curved away, after initially dipping on Bairstow, then passed the outside edge and hit the top of off stump. Dream delivery for a left-arm spinner and the crowd go wild. Bishen Singh Bedi would've approved. England in a shambles. Enter Bresnan - one Yorkshireman to replace another. Bairstow b Ravindra Jadeja 9(19) [4s-1] Ravindra Jadeja to Bairstow, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

ENGLAND:29.4  Ravindra Jadeja to Bopara, out Lbw!! There were glum faces in the England dressing room before that ball and the numbers will only grow after that. What a poor stroke from Bopara under the circumstances. England's get out of jail shot is the sweep, but Bopara gets himself into jail after he misses a straight delivery on the stumps. He had pre-meditated the shot and missed it. Pretty plumb even though Bopara tried to deceive the umpire by showing his bat - indicating that he may have got an edge. Asnani is a trigger happy umpire who likes giving LBWs, but that was too plumb even for him not to give it out. End of Bopara and England in a hole - haven't we seen that before in this series? Bopara lbw b Ravindra Jadeja 8(19) Ravindra Jadeja to Bopara, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!

ENGLAND:27.6  Ravindra Jadeja to Bairstow, no run, left alone to a ball outside off. Three successive dots after a boundary. That's where England have failed miserably in this ODI series. They seem to get the boundary and then play a succession of dots - which is playing right into India's hands. You won't see that when India is batting and the scoreline in the series rightly reflects that.
ENGLAND:27.5  Ravindra Jadeja to Bairstow, no run, goes on the backfoot and pushes without any timing to cover
ENGLAND:27.4  Ravindra Jadeja to Bairstow, no run, much better. Straight and on the stumps, Bairstow pushes it back to Ravindra Jadeja
ENGLAND:27.3  Ravindra Jadeja to Bairstow, FOUR!!, down leg and Bairstow's top edged sweep goes away to the fine leg fence. Short fine was in and Bairstow will pick up a boundary that should ease the pressure on his side. Wrong line from Ravindra Jadeja though

ENGLAND:26.4  Ashwin to Pietersen, out Caught by (sub)Manoj Tiwary at deep mid wicket!! That is a ripper of a catch. He made it look so easy. That was slog swept powerfully and seemed heading for the boundary, but Tiwary running to his right was airborne even as he clasped it without any fuss. He then went to ground and threw the ball back nonchalantly. The umpires were checking for the no-ball, but Ashwin was fine. Pietersen still has to wait for his ODI ton - he hasn't got one in three years. Pietersen c (sub)Manoj Tiwary b Ashwin 41(61) [4s-3 6s-1] Ashwin to Pietersen, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ENGLAND:25.6  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, beaten again. This has been a top over despite that boundary.

Sourav is right on air, when he says that the English are making ordinary deliveries look great.
ENGLAND:25.5  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, FOUR!!, the pressure releasing boundary arrives. Low full toss that curves away, Pietersen had an almighty swish at that and toe ended it down to the third man fence. The man was too square and it ran away. Vinay Kumar has a grimace on his face

Alastair Cook is on strike. Praveen Kumar will open the attackRight, out come the two openers. England will be looking to get off to a great start and not lose too many wickets at the start. Praveen Kumar is all set to unleash his swing here.Teams:India (Playing XI): Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Vinay Kumar, Varun AaronEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Ravi Bopara, Jonathan Bairstow, Samit Patel, Tim Bresnan, Scott Borthwick, Steven Finn, Stuart MeakerDhoni: The World Cup was a big moment and we will always remember it. It is important to prove that we are a good side. We wanted the spinners to get into the action. Varun Aaron replaces Umesh Yadav in the team.Cook: We will bat first. We will try and win the last two games. Meaker and Borthwick come into the team. It is all about fine tuning the mistakes. India is a powerful batting line-up.England have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: There is a good grass covering on this pitch. There will be some moisture on this pitch at the start. It is well rolled in and hard. There will be good carry for the bowlers, reckons Saurav Ganguly. There will be some extra bounce on offer due to the soil and there will be something for the spinners. Dew will not have much of an impact.Andy Flower has already stated that England might make a couple of changes as well. Ian Bell may finally get a go while Stuart Meaker, reputed to be the fastest bowler in England might make his debut. Scott Borthwick did very well in the practise match against Hyderabad XI and might get a go on a spin friendly Mumbai track.India might do a little bit of experimentation. Umesh Yadav has been injured and will be replaced by either Varun Aaron who has warmed the benches ever since the England tour or Sreenath Aravind. There is also a possibility of Rahul Sharma replacing Ravichandran Ashwin. Will Manoj Tiwary get a chance? If he does, it might be at the cost of Parthiv Patel.Hello, and welcome to Super Sunday. We have the Rugby World Cup final kicking off, the Manchester derby later in the evening, South Africa and Australia lock horns in Port Elizabeth and India are back to the venue that brought them joy in winning their 2nd World Cup. The series has been done and dusted, England will play for pride. India will play for dominance. The Wankhede will watch its stars back in action, sans its favourite hero, Sachin Tendulkar who will miss his first ever India match at his home turf. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates..Preview by Saurabh SomaniIt's been an interesting few days between matches in the India-England series. The action on field will resume with the fourth ODI, but the sound-bytes off-field have caused almost as much drama. While MS Dhoni took a not-so-subtle swipe at some of the behaviour by the England team on the field, the reaction from the England camp was all about how they took fierce pride in their game and that there was nothing really wrong with the players' behaviour on field. As England have discovered though, the bluster does not really work if you can't back it up with results on the field. It did show vast improvement in the third ODI, but still wasn't enough to get them over the line.England: They need to continue on the improvement curve they established in the third ODI, if they want to avoid a white-wash in the series. Most of the work needs to be done by the bowlers, who haven't been impressive in any of the games so far as a collective force. Graeme Swann and Steve Finn have been the best of the lot, but each has had a match with no wickets and their economy rates of 5.21 and 5.75 aren't eye-popping either. The worrying aspect for England is that all other bowlers have even higher economy rates. The batsmen too, haven't been altogether free of blame, even when they put on 298 in the 3rd ODI. Given the flat nature of the pitch, and the eventual result, 320 should have been the score achieved especially since England didn't lose too many wickets.India: India have given as good an illustration of home advantage as England had given them a few short weeks ago so far in the series. Two comprehensive wins and one win that demanded some character have already handed them the series. Although a white-wash in ODIs will not really be equivalent to the white-wash India suffered in the England Test series, it will surely go some way towards re-establishing India's credibility as a powerful cricket team - which had taken a bit of a beating. Even if the wins come at home, the mere act of winning - and winning well - reinforces belief in team and fan. India have been good overall in the series and even with batsmen and bowlers both firing, the most pleasing aspect will surely be the raised fielding standards exhibited by the hosts. It may not have been anticipated, but along with out-batting and out-bowling England, India have also out-fielded them so far.Team Compositions:Both teams could possibly look at making some changes to their playing eleven, given that the series is already decided. For England, the clamour to include Ian Bell in the eleven is increasing daily, with many not able to fathom why he wasn't part of it in the first place. Jade Dernbach's less than sterling show has also led to calls to include Stuart Meaker. For India, Umesh Yadav is out with an injury and Abhimanyu Mithun has been drafted in to the squad. The man who most will be expecting to replace Yadav however, is Varun Aaron who can match Yadav for pace and has created quite a buzz around him with his pace. Whether that buzz can be justified or not, is something that only an on-field performance will show.Final Word:The venue is the Wankhede - scene of India's World Cup triumph, and the weather forecast is for bright, sunny skies. England will need some of that sun to shine on their luck if they are to compete. Of all the stats in the series so far, perhaps the most illustrative is that England have only one bowler who has an economy rate of less than 5.50, while India have only one whose economy rate is more than 5.50.
