Two slips in placeThe players are out in the middle.. We are set for the start of the 2nd match of the tri-nation series..Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Mitchell Marsh, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Kane RichardsonBailey: "We were looking to bowl first as well. It'll be hard work early on, especially with a bit of moisture around. I was really proud of the boys the other day. Hughes comes in on this new wicket, Lyon misses out. Clarke's coming along nicely and I'd be very surprised if he doesn't play in the back end of the series."De Villiers: "We are going to bowl first. It looks good, hopefully we'll get a few early wickets. The guys needed a bit of time away from the game, just get the minds relaxed. A lot of guys are bowling well, a lot of depth there but I am looking forward to an all-round show today. Phangiso misses out."Pitch Report: "There is a bit of rolled in grass. It is hard at the top and looks like there is a bit of moisture. Maybe it will aid the pacers early on but on the whole, it's a good wicket to bat on," reckons Shaun Pollock.So South Africa are back to full strength with the return of ABdV, Amla, Steyn and Morne. Meanwhile, Australia leave out Lyon, Hughes comes in and will open, Haddin drops down the order.South Africa have won the toss and have opted to fieldWill Michael Clarke play? That's the big question at the moment. The news is that he's still a doubtful starter. We saw the other day that Glenn Maxwell is still hungry for quick, big runs. However, today he has to tackle a world-class bowler in Dale Steyn. Just can't wait for these big guns to lock horns with each other. The toss is not too far away, we'll bring you that and more in a short while. Stay tuned...Ah! What a contest we have on the cards today. It's the clash between two cricketing giants - Australia and South Africa - in the second match of this tri-series. The former had a great day at the office a couple days ago when they thrashed hosts Zimbabwe in the opener, while the latter too have some momentum with them after sweeping the bilateral series against Zimbabwe that preceded the tri-nation event.Preview by Bharath RamarajAustralia will take on South Africa in the second match of the tri-series being played in Zimbabwe. Australia smashed hosts, Zimbabwe to smithereens in the first ODI. Most of Australia's batsmen performed well against what was a listless bowling performance from Zimbabwe. However, it was Glenn Maxwell, who caught the eye with his thrill-a-minute innings of 93.At the other end of the spectrum, their opposition for the second match of the tri-series, South Africa, have got accustomed to the conditions in Zimbabwe by playing an one-off Test match and three ODIs against the hosts. The Proteas though, would know that there is huge gulf in terms of class between Australia and Zimbabwe.South AfricaThe South African think-tank would welcome the return of Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn. Both pacers were rested for the ODIs against Zimbabwe. If Steyn tests a batsman's defence with his razor sharp out-swinger and bouncers then, Morkel can get that disconcerting bounce even from a good length. However, it has to be said that if anything, Steyn is marginally a better bowler in Test matches. Generally, bowlers who angle it back into a right-handed batsman to tuck them up for room do slightly better in ODIs.Ryan McLaren/Kyle Abbott is expected to play the supporting role. McLaren has a calm head on his shoulders and keeps it simple by hitting back of a length in ODIs. On the other hand, Abbott impressed during the 3-match ODI series with his pace and accuracy. Imran Tahir, with his wrong-un may just come in handy especially, while bowling to one of the brightest lights in the opposition camp, Maxwell. 'Big Show', as he is fondly called, Maxwell is known for his cavalier stroke-play but he tends to play across the line, and that is when the wrong un can come into play. It has to be remembered that leg-spinners did trouble Maxwell in Indian Premier League (IPL) 2014.Among the batsmen, AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla continue to be the bedrocks of the line-up. Amla, has the ability to notch up big scores. He seems to have preternatural hand-eye co-ordination to place the ball to minutest of gaps. de Villiers is known for producing high-octane stuff with a willow in hand.Faf du Plessis hasn't yet shown the kind of skills that made him the key batsman for Lancashire Lightning in England's domestic cricket. However, he has a chance to leave an indelible mark for the Rainbow Nation, as he has been given a chance to bat at No.3. In JP Duminy, Quinton de Kock and David Miller, South Africa have the line-up to put up monstrous scores on the board. In particular, de Kock has been in fine form.AustraliaIn their first game, Australia made short work of lightweights, Zimbabwe. Their batsmen were in prime form and the quick bowlers just didn't give the opposition ranks a chance to show their wares.Aaron Finch and Brad Haddin at top of the order played on the up and through the line. Both batsmen would definitely like the even bounce on offer at Harare Sports Club. However, it was Mitchell Marsh and more so Maxwell, who pressed on the accelerator pedal to deliver that coup de main for Australia. In short, Australia have enough fire-power in the batting line-up. Even Mitchell Starc batting at No. 10 can wield the willow.In the bowling department, Mitchell Johnson, with his extra pace is always going to be a threat. He also uses the cross-seam to good effect in ODIs. Starc and James Faulkner can hold their own too as bowlers. Nathan Lyon, the off-spinner has also been given a chance to show his worth in this format. The only worry perhaps is regarding Kane Richardson, as he was taken for runs by Zimbabwe's batsmen. If Richardson has to play, he perhaps needs to be given the new ball, as he is a swing bowler.Australia also have to worry about the fitness of their skipper, Michael Clarke, who continues to be plagued by injuries.Ground conditionsHarare Sports Club is known for producing wickets with even bounce. Now, that is good news for both batsmen and bowlers. The toss shouldn't really play a key role in the outcome of the match.Quotes"It happens a little bit too often," Bailey said about Clarke's injury woes. "Hopefully 'Pup' will be right for the back end of this series. Rest up for the first couple and then get himself right."Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Aaron Phangiso, Mthokozisi Shezi, Kyle Abbott, Rilee RossouwAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, Brad Haddin(w), George Bailey(c), Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith, James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Kane Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Phillip Hughes, Ben Cutting, Michael ClarkeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
