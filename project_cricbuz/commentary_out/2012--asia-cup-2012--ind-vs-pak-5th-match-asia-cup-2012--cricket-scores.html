The bowlers have left a tall order for the batsmen yet again. India have chased steep targets before, but they are up against one of the best bowling attacks in the world at the momentWhat a fine batting display it has been by Pakistan. They were certainly helped by some lacklustre bowling by the Indians but one has to give credit to Hafeez and Nasir for the way they played. The openers batted solidly to give Pakistan a wonderful platform to take off from and at one stage it looked as though India were never going to pick up a wicket. Eventually the batting powerplay led to the openers' downfall but a cameo from Umar Akmal and half century from Younis Khan powered Pakistan to 329 for 6. It looks like a daunting target especially with the kind of bowlers Pakistan has, however, can India's star studded line up chase it down? Do join us shortly for the 2nd innings4

We are all set to begin this cracking encounter.Ravindra Jadeja is unwell and that is why he has not been picked in this match. Dhoni was clueless when he came to speak during the toss as he did not know whether he was batting or bowling first.Teams:India (Playing XI): Gautam Gambhir, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, MS Dhoni(w/c), Yusuf Pathan, Irfan Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Ashok DindaPakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Hammad Azam, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Wahab Riaz, Aizaz CheemaDhoni: We wanted to bowl first. We do not want the opposition to put some big runs. It is an important game. We made mistakes and we did not execute our plans. Yusuf Pathan replaces Ravindra Jadeja.Misbah: It is a good track to bat on. Everybody is really focused about this game and I am telling the boys to stick to the basics. Every game is important and India-Pakistan games are important. We have to give our 100%. Sarfraz Ahmed is not playing and Riaz comes in.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: The rest day has allowed the curator to water the pitch. Sunil Gavaskar reckons that there will be a lot of runs on this pitch. If the batsmen are not nervous, then they can score runs freely. It is a contest between Pakistan's bowlers and India's batsmen.Pakistan have played eight ODIs in Mirpur. They have won seven and lost one match. Their only loss at this venue was against India during the Kitply cup in 2008.If it was not for the Asia Cup, we might not have seen an India vs Pakistan encounter. One hopes that we can soon see bilateral action between these two nations.The last match between these two nations was during the 2011 World Cup semi-final at Mohali. India emerged victorious in that encounter and keep their record of never having lost to Pakistan in the marquee tournament.When the atmosphere is electric, when passion is at a fever-pitch, when fans display patriotism like never before, you know that it is an India vs Pakistan encounter. Welcome to this titanic clash between these two arch-rivals. Pakistan have almost sealed their spot in the final while India will look to win this and keep their chances of reaching the final bright. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.It's time for India vs Pakistan! The last time these two teams met was at the World Cup semi-final at Mohali, where the hosts and eventual champions India outplayed the visitors. A lot of things have happened in the year after that, and the situation is very different from how it was back then. Pakistan have become a much more consistent team, and India have been jolted by losses abroad. The Asia Cup encounter is more important for India than it is for Pakistan, as the latter have virtually qualified for the final. India, coming after a shock-loss to Bangladesh, will have to play out of their skins against their arch rivals in a high-pressure game.Srivathsa, who thinks Pakistan are the better side, and Karthik, who thinks India are better, discuss their team's chances.Srivathsa: Going into a must win game, India's confidence is at an all-time low. I don't think they can beat a resurgent Pakistan, can they?Karthik: There is no reason for India's confidence to be at an all-time low. Yes, Bangladesh did cause a shock-upset but India did defeat Sri Lanka in the game before that (and even the Hobart match in Australia). Even the match against Bangladesh was a close one, and it's not as if the hosts outplayed India in the victory. Pakistan won convincingly against Sri Lanka but, like India, struggled against Bangladesh and just about managed to win.Srivathsa: India's bowling has lacked the firepower and the imagination to take wickets. I can't see India defending a total with this toothless attack.Karthik: You just have to watch India's first match against Sri Lanka to find out the answer. India scored over 300 but that still was not a huge score on that track, but India's bowlers managed to defend the total. Sri Lanka were in fact poised to win the game at one stage, but India's bowlers brought them back in a superb fashion and dismissed the opposition. They did panic against Bangladesh, but that can happen to any team.Srivathsa: In both the games India batted slowly and were well short of what was a defendable score. I would go on to say that Sachin's tuk-tuk innings cost India the last game. When personal goals are given more precedence over the team, could well deny them a chance of reaching the final.Karthik: Once again, you have unintentionally answered your second question by saying India didn't score defendable scores. It is not correct to blame Sachin for the loss to Bangladesh - he did play according to the pitch (which was slow) and set a platform for the team to get to a big score. Unfortunately, the bowlers could not defend it and the blame has unfairly gone to Sachin. Also, we should give credit to Bangladesh for the way they paced their chase - something which we easily forget.Srivathsa: Pakistan have the best bowling line-up in the tournament and will surely go in as favorites against an under pressure Indian side. Also Pakistan lift their game facing india and have a better head-head record, so Sunday's game should be an easy one for Pakistan.Karthik: If Pakistan have the best bowling line up, then India have the best batting line up. In the two games, India's top 3 batsmen - Gambhir, Tendulkar and Kohli - have scored centuries and the ones following them - Raina and Dhoni have also contributed. The big monkey is off Sachin's back so expect him to be back to his best in the future. In both the matches, India's batsmen have been able to put up big scores so there is no pressure on them. Head to head records count for nothing, it's all about what the teams are doing at present. Anyways, India won the last 2 games against Pakistan - in the World Cup and the previous edition of the Asia Cup.Karthik: Pakistan's problems start right at the top. The openers did well against Bangladesh but they were terribly slow. Hafeez, who is known for his strokeplay, looked to be struggling and trying too hard to get back to form. In their match against Sri Lanka, they started slowly and suddenly slumped to 33-3. Don't they need a better platform at the top?Srivathsa: Pakistan believe in the slow yet steady approach. That has been the new mantra under Misbah. A slow yet solid platform at the top gives the stroke-players like Younis and Umar Akmal to flourish. And then we have Boom Boom to blast away which is the perfect scenario. With the kind of bowling that we have a score that is defendable is enough and that's what we aim for.Karthik: On flat tracks like the ones in the sub-continent, matches are won by the batsmen more often than by the bowlers. India's batting is far superior, which gives them an advantage.Srivathsa: If India's batting is superior, then we have the best bowling line-up in the tourney to take care of it. Once our batting starts giving a decent score to defend, then it becomes easier for our bowlers to restrict the opposition. The tracks in the tournament haven't been that flat - it starts to flatten out only under lights when the dew makes the ball to skid on to the bat and we have seen so far that whatever India post with the bat, it isn't enough for them to defend, with their woeful bowling. So that takes India's batting superiority out of the equation.Karthik: When it comes to India vs Pakistan, the latter often seem to succumb under pressure, like they did in the World Cup last year. Even in the last edition of the Asia Cup, it was India who came out on top.Srivathsa: This is a vastly different side to the one that played in the WC last year or to the one that played in the Asia Cup last time. This side is playing consistent cricket under Misbah and look a happy and settled side. In fact this is a pressure game for India and not for us. It is India who have to do all the running and that makes it easier for us to impose ourselves on the game.Karthik: Pakistan's unpredictability has always been a cause of concern. They won the first 2 games of the Asia Cup but were whitewashed by England recently. Will they ever become a consistent team?Srivathsa: If you take out the England ODI series, Pakistan have been highly consistent over the last one year under Misbah especially in this format. The tag of being unpredictable is a thing of the past with this Pakistani side, instead it is acquiring the reputation of being a boring yet winning side with a hint of ruthlessness thrown in. The results recently testify to the fact the Pakistan have shed the 'unpredictable' tag.Karthik: Let's hope the match lives up to the hype around it!Srivathsa: ..and a victory for Pakistan!Teams:Pakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Aizaz Cheema, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi, Umar Gul, Younis Khan, Abdur Rehman, Asad Shafiq, Hammad Azam, Nasir Jamshed, Wahab Riaz, Umar AkmalIndia (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Virat Kohli, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashok Dinda, Gautam Gambhir, Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar, Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan, Suresh Raina, Sachin Tendulkar, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay Kumar, Rohit Sharma, Rahul SharmaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
