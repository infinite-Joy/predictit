There was a clear deflection but the replays weren't conclusive enough to say if it only hit the forearm. Because the on-field umpire gave it out, Misbah's review goes in vain. Massive blow for Pakistan. Misbah c Ronchi b Matt Henry 47(65) [4s-2 6s-2]Matt Henry to Misbah, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Misbah has reviewed a caught-behind call against him. He reckons it hit the forearm. Well, well, well, the straight angle shows it might have hit the glove. I am not sure if there's enough evidence to overturn the decision. It's a tough call for the third umpire and the on-field call stays. Misbah can't believe it.

Now we've got to bowl well and hopefully the dew comes in later on. We've got Corey Anderson and Matt Henry in today, Nathan McCullum and Jimmy Neesham are out"Misbah: "We will bat first. We think that here under lights, batting could be difficult sometimes. We hope that there's no dew tonight. Wonderful performance by the lower middle-order the other night, the bowlers did decently well as well. Umar Gul is not fit today, Sohail Tanvir comes in."Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batPitch: "It's another beautiful day. The pitch is a little bit different to the Dubai wicket because there is a little of shine on it. The stats suggest that you'd want to bat first. 230 is a difficult score to get to. I think it is going to be a beautiful batting wicket. 230-240 is going to be a good score. Win the toss and bat first," reckons Scott StyrisBoth teams had their problems with the bat in the first game. If New Zealand were reduced to 111/5, Pakistan were placed precariously at 86/5 in their reply. It is quite clear that both sides have to improve their show with the bat, especially with the World Cup fast approaching. It is a big blow to Pakistan that Mohammad Hafeez cannot bowl because of the ban. Captain Misbah-ul-Haq has said that the emphasis is the on finding the right combination for the World Cup. It will be interesting to see the changes, if any, in both the sides. Toss and more coming up in a very short while. Stay tuned...Pakistan came from behind to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in the first ODI. Can New Zealand deliver quality goods and level the series today? Or, will the hosts, who broke their 5-match losing streak in the series opener, make it 2-0? We'll find out in a few hours from now. Hello and a warm welcome to what promises to be an exciting second ODI at Sharjah.PreviewAfter New Zealand lost the first ODI in Dubai to Pakistan, Kane Williamson, their captain, said that they have the ability to bounce back and win the second game to be played in Sharjah on Friday. Williamson, also hoped that they can learn from their mistakes and put up an improved performance in the second match.Only Ross Taylor was able to adjust to the conditions and compose his 11th hundred in the game played in Dubai. The bowlers took wickets upfront, but weren't able to stop Pakistan from winning the game."It's important to bounce back. We have done that in the past and in the Test and, T20I series on this tour," Williamson, who took over the mantle of captaining the New Zealand unit after Brendon McCullum was rested told reporters.New Zealand staged a remarkable comeback to level the three-match Test series 1-1 after losing the first game and drawing the second Test. Even in the T20I series, New Zealand's cricketers showed that one-pointed focus to come from behind and level the series 1-1.New Zealand have a few injury concerns to worry about. Corey Anderson, who was hit by a bouncer in the first T20I and Martin Guptill, suffering from a hamstring injury, will be assessed before the game starts.On the other hand, it was Shahid Afridi and Haris Sohail, who helped Pakistan to chase down New Zealand's target after they found themselves in a spot of bother by losing early wickets.On his part, Pakistan's skipper, Misbah-ul-Haq, admitted that New Zealand can be a dangerous opponent and have the ability to make a sterling comeback. "New Zealand is playing good cricket and they have improved a lot in the last two to three years. The way they have played on this tour, we have to be at our best to win against them," said Misbah.Misbah hoped that his pace bowlers can come to the party in the ODI to be played in Sharjah. "Given the conditions, our fast bowlers did well in the first game, despite little support from the pitch. I hope that they continue to bowl like that," added Misbah.Opener, Mohammad Hafeez, is likely to be retained for the second match, before leaving for Chennai for remedial work on his bowling action. He was suspended from bowling after his action was deemed illegal last week. There is a chance that Umar Gul, the experienced seamer, who has struggled to make his mark in recent times will be replaced by Sohail Tanvir.Teams:New Zealand (From): Anton Devcich, Dean Brownlie, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Tom Latham, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Adam Milne, Mitchell McClenaghan, Matt Henry, Corey Anderson, Martin GuptillPakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Younis Khan, Haris Sohail, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Mohammad Irfan, Nasir Jamshed, Bilawal Bhatti, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Akmal, Zulfiqar BabarLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
