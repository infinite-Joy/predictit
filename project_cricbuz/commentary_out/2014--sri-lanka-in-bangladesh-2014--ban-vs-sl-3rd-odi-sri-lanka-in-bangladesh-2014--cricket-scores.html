Here we go....Welcome back for the run chase. With no Dilshan, Sanga and Mahela for the first time since 1999, the onus is on the inexperienced batters to see Sri Lanka through to victory. Will they be able to step-up or will they succumb? We will find out soon....The pacers stood-out among the Lankan bowlers as they picked up 6 wickets between them and didn't concede too much. It is now upto the young batting line-up to see the team through to victory and complete the whitewash. Join us back in a few minutes for the run chase.....The Sri Lankan bowlers have done an excellent job after Mathews sent the hosts in to bat. Anamul and Shamsur got off to a sedate start, but Mominul came in and provided the momentum to the innings. He was aggressive in his approach and notched up his maiden ODI fifty before a needless second run and an excellent bit of fielding led to his downfall. Rahim took over the mantle and guided the innings but he too fell just when he was looking good. Naeem and Nasir stitched a decent 54-run stand before the latter got out off the last ball of the batting powerplay. Gazi hit some meaty blows in the end to get Bangladesh past the 200 mark.4

Shamsur strides out to the middle with Anamul right at his toes.So, Malinga and Mendis have also been given a break. This means that the spotlight shifts to Sri Lanka's bench strength.Rahim: "It is a big match. Hopefully the boys will do the process right. Yeah, a win will give us confidence ahead of the Asia Cup. We will have to stick our the plan. The bowlers did well in the first two ODIs. We will have to capitalize on the chances. Mashrafe misses out and Shakib too."Mathews: 'We will have a bowl first. I feel the wicket is damp. It will help the seamers early on. I just realised that yesterday (when asked of Sri Lanka playing without the either of Mahela, Sanga and Dilshan after 15 years). They have been playing continously. It is now up to the youngsters to perform. Thirimanne, Angelo Parera, Dhammika Prasad and Lakmal come in.'Pitch report: 'It's a lovely day at Mirpur. This pitch was used for the first ODI. There is a bit of green tinge on thid pitch. There may be a little bit moisture as well. But it is a good batting pitch. I expect the set batsmen to go and make big runs.' says Athar Ali KhanThe injury prone Mortaza misses out with Shafiul Islam earing a recall. Meanwhile, Naeem Islam replaces Shakib.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kushal Janith Perera(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Ashan Priyanjan, Kithuruwan Vithanage, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Angelo Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Dhammika Prasad, Suranga LakmalBangladesh (Playing XI): Anamul Haque(w), Shamsur Rahman, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim(c), Naeem Islam, Mahmudullah, Nasir Hossain, Sohag Gazi, Arafat Sunny, Shafiul Islam, Rubel HossainSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldWe will bring you the toss and team updates in a few minutes...Stay tuned...However, the hosts have quite a few problems of their own. Mortaza's fitness is a major concern and so is the weak form of their middle order. On top of it, Shakib has been suspended for 3 ODIs for inappropriate conduct during the last game. They do not lack talented players and can certainly re-group to salvage the lost pride at home. A win today will be a major boost to their confidence.The series has already been won by Sri Lanka essentially making today's game a dead rubber. They will be keen on making a comprehensive 3-0 clean sweep but without the presence of Sangakkara, Mahela and Dilshan. It is the first time since 1999, that the visitors are without either of their top players. This might prove as a blessing in disguise for Bangladesh, who will be hoping for a consolation win before heading into the Asia Cup.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Al-Amin Hossain, Mahmudullah, Mominul Haque, Nasir Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Shamsur Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Sohag Gazi, Tamim Iqbal, Mashrafe Mortaza, Anamul Haque, Arafat Sunny, Naeem Islam, Shafiul IslamSri Lanka (From): Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal(w), Kithuruwan Vithanage, Ajantha Mendis, Suranga Lakmal, Angelo Perera, Lasith Malinga, Sachithra Senanayake, Seekkuge Prasanna, Thisara Perera, Kushal Janith Perera, Ashan Priyanjan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dhammika PrasadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
