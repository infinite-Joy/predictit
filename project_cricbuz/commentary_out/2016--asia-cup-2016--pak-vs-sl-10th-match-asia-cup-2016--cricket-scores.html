PAKISTAN:19.2 19.2T Perera to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, with the field brought up, Malik tries to go over them. The length is too full to get underneath though and he hits it straight to mid-off. Kulasekara puts it down and Pakistan win. In anti-climatic style it has to be said but Malik will take it
PAKISTAN:19.1 T Perera to Shoaib Malik, no run, follows a stunning catch with a yorker on off, Malik digs it out barelyThisara Perera [2.0-0-24-0] is back into the attackIftikhar Ahmed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:18.6 Kulasekara to U Akmal, out Caught by T Perera!! That should be it, lofted wide of long-off, and .. wait. Is that taken? Oh brilliant. What a catch from Perera! Full ball just outside off, Akmal slapped it inside out, probably didn't get it as wide as he would have liked but still looked good. Perera sprints to his left, sticks his hands overhead on the run and cups it safely before tumbling down. Amazing! U Akmal c T Perera b Kulasekara 48(37) [4s-4 6s-2]Kulasekara to U Akmal, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:18.5 Kulasekara to U Akmal, SIX, boom! Clears the front leg to a fullish ball and heaves it over wide long-on. Smack-bang off the middle
PAKISTAN:18.4 Kulasekara to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, another brilliant yorker as Malik drills it towards long-on to raise the 50-run stand. A match-winning one *I said it in a whisper*
PAKISTAN:18.3 Kulasekara to U Akmal, 1 run, good bounce from a length on off, hits Akmal high on the bat as he tries to hoist it straight down. Mistimes it to long-on
PAKISTAN:18.2 Kulasekara to U Akmal, no run, almost a yorker outside off, Akmal tries to clatter a drive through extra-cover but drags it back to the bowler
PAKISTAN:18.1 Kulasekara to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, walks out to a full ball outside off and turns it to deep mid-wicketWell I'm afraid, the goof-up from the keeper, and then the full toss from Chameera have nailed Lanka's fate. 10 runs needed off 12. Even Pakistan can't fluff this one.
PAKISTAN:17.6 Chameera to U Akmal, no run, short of length delivery outside off, dabbed to backward point
PAKISTAN:17.5 Chameera to U Akmal, FOUR, full toss outside off, Akmal stands tall and punches it through extra-cover. The sweeper sprints after it to his right, puts in a desperate dive but in vain
PAKISTAN:17.4 Chameera to U Akmal, 2 runs, mistimes the inside out loft in the air, probably off the toe-end. But it's will-o'-the-wisp. Enough to get it over extra-cover and wide of a chasing sweeper cover
PAKISTAN:17.3 Chameera to U Akmal, no run, full outside off, driven to extra-cover
PAKISTAN:17.2 Chameera to U Akmal, byes, FOUR, dear me. Dickwella has failed to collect a leg-break which came on the bounce. Hardly got a glove as it bounced over his hands. Chameera had managed to beat Akmal for the lack of pace on the dab. But then!
PAKISTAN:17.2 Chameera to U Akmal, wide, oh that's close. Bordering on the tramlines, and the umpire signals wide
PAKISTAN:17.1 Chameera to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, stretches his hands to reach out to a length ball very wide of off, might have been a wide had he left it alone. He reached out so far that there could have been no power on the cross-batted drive. Mistimes it to sweeper cover22 required from 3 overs. 7 wickets in hand. A betting man would put his money on the chasing team. That's before reading Pakistan. On a serious note, Afridi and Co. are favourites here, but we've seen funnier things happen in cricket! 
PAKISTAN:16.6 Kulasekara to U Akmal, no run, lovely yorker. Kula drawing from his years of experience. All Akmal can do is dig it out
PAKISTAN:16.5 Kulasekara to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, good ball. Very full and gunning for the base of middle, Malik clears the front leg and squeezes a drive to long-on
PAKISTAN:16.4 Kulasekara to U Akmal, 1 run, right glove over left as he flogs a low full toss in the air, luckily for Akmal, the timing isn't good enough and the ball drops on the bounce to deep mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:16.3 Kulasekara to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, fullish on the stumps, Malik tries to go straight down the ground with a lofted drive but the bat twists slightly and he drags it in front of long-on
PAKISTAN:16.2 Kulasekara to U Akmal, 1 run, slips in a full ball just outside off, Akmal rolls his wrists furiously and whips it to deep mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:16.1 Kulasekara to U Akmal, FOUR, takes a couple of steps down the track, picks the slower ball, waits for it and drives it with a flourish inside-out over a leaping extra-coverNuwan Kulasekara [2.0-0-3-0] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:15.6 Chameera to Shoaib Malik, no run, tries a similar delivery, doesn't rip as much this time, Malik carefully nudges it back. Excellent over from Chameera, just the 2 singles off it
PAKISTAN:15.5 Chameera to Shoaib Malik, no run, a leg-break at 124ks, gripped in the pitch on a back of a length and completely squared Malik as he tried to work it through the on-side. Spins away a mile past the outside edge on the bounce to the keeper
PAKISTAN:15.4 Chameera to U Akmal, 1 run, slashed to third man. Not a lot of width at all but Akmal's hands are so good, he flashes hard and skims it to the fielder
PAKISTAN:15.3 Chameera to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, lifts nicely from a short of length outside off, glided down to third man
PAKISTAN:15.2 Chameera to Shoaib Malik, no run, jumps awkwardly to a short of length delivery which didn't get up all that high, fends it into the off-side
PAKISTAN:15.1 Chameera to Shoaib Malik, no run, nips back ever so slightly from a length outside off to cut Malik into half. Beaten comprehensivelyDushmantha Chameera [2.0-0-22-0] is back into the attackIt's come down drastically, the required rate. Just over 6-an-over required
PAKISTAN:14.6 Siriwardana to U Akmal, FOUR, 19 off the over! That seals it one would presume. Dishes out a full toss outside off, Akmal can't believe his luck. Simply laces the drive wide of long-off
PAKISTAN:14.5 Siriwardana to U Akmal, no run, driven to the left of the bowler who runs around to stop
PAKISTAN:14.4 Siriwardana to U Akmal, FOUR, Siriwardana's over has proved to be a game-changer! But unfortunately, it's gone the other way. Another drag-down on the stumps, Akmal feasts on it again and blasts the pull in the same region. A bounce before going over this time
PAKISTAN:14.3 Siriwardana to U Akmal, SIX, clanked! A half-tracker on the stumps, allows Akmal to jump back and pummel the pull over square leg. Just about carries
PAKISTAN:14.2 Siriwardana to U Akmal, 2 runs, tossed up outside off, Akmal leans into it nicely and drives it wide of long-off. Wide enough for the batsmen to put their skates on and hare back
PAKISTAN:14.1 Siriwardana to Shoaib Malik, 3 runs, beautifully played. Went right back to the stumps, made his own room and ... waited. Then dabbed it almost out of the keeper's gloves to send it fine. Excellent effort from Kula running back and diving to flick the ball insideLong as Malik is out there, calmness should prevail in that Pakistani change-room. 51 from 36, it's their game to lose
PAKISTAN:13.6 Herath to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, looped up outside off to invite a nice flowing cover-drive from Malik. Bent his back knee elegantly and hit it with the turn to sweeper cover
PAKISTAN:13.5 Herath to U Akmal, 1 run, shimmies down and almost gets too close to the flighted ball, jams the drive to long-off
PAKISTAN:13.4 Herath to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, sliding into the pads, a good roll of the wrists on the ball fetches Malik a single
PAKISTAN:13.3 Herath to U Akmal, 1 run, Akmal is preferring to play from the crease which makes him vulnerable to the quicker and fuller arm-ball. As it happens, this one isn't. Whipped through mid-wicket for a single
PAKISTAN:13.2 Herath to Shoaib Malik, 1 run, drops it slightly short and that's enough for Malik to rock back and pull it down to deep backward square
PAKISTAN:13.1 Herath to U Akmal, 1 run, flatter on off, clipped through mid-wicketRangana Herath [3.0-0-22-0] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:12.6 Siriwardana to Shoaib Malik, no run, slows the pace down and gets some turn from a fuller length to foil Malik's attempted cover-drive. Gets a thick edge towards pointShoaib Malik, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:12.5 Siriwardana to Sarfraz, out Lbw!! A very high-pitched scream for an appeal, and the umpire puts his finger up. Once Sarfraz missed with the sweep, he smelt trouble. And quite rightly so. Picked the wrong length I think. Tossed up and skidding on from round the wicket, the length is too full for the sweep which causes Sarfraz to miss out. Hit fairly low on the pad in front of off. Would have taken down the leg-stump at least. Oh no, HawkEye shows the ball smacking into middle of middle. Sarfraz lbw b Siriwardana 38(27) [4s-6]Siriwardana to Sarfraz, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
PAKISTAN:12.4 Siriwardana to U Akmal, 1 run, flatter and sliding on towards middle, nudged down to long-on from the crease

PAKISTAN:12.1 Siriwardana to U Akmal, no run, shortish on off from round the wicket, sticks in the pitch slightly to take a thick leading edge on Akmal's attempted whip. Rolls back safely down the pitchMilinda Siriwardana, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:11.6 T Perera to Sarfraz, FOUR, shocking delivery. It took me back to a ball he bowled to MS Dhoni in the World Cup final at the Wankhede and this time too he is dealt with the same treatment. Short, wide and sitting up. Sarfraz hops and flays it over backward point with utmost ease
PAKISTAN:11.5 T Perera to U Akmal, 1 run, picks a back of a length delivery from outside off, and clips it through mid-wicket on the hop
PAKISTAN:11.4 T Perera to Sarfraz, 1 run, hurls in a fullish ball outside off, driven to sweeper cover
PAKISTAN:11.3 T Perera to Sarfraz, FOUR, oh nice! Near yorker wide of off, Sarfraz stretches out and simply plants an open bat-face on the ball and it skims off wide of third man. Should say that there needed to be a better effort in the deep. The fielder dived and got to it with both hands but it sneaked through
PAKISTAN:11.2 T Perera to U Akmal, 1 run, upper-body leans nicely into a fullish ball wide of off, drives it to sweeper cover
PAKISTAN:11.1 T Perera to Sarfraz, 1 run, short of length delivery hurrying Sarfraz in the pull and he swats it down to long-onThisara Perera [1.0-0-12-0] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:10.6 Herath to Sarfraz, 1 run, backs away and Herath follows him with a slider, still goes through with an attempted punch and chops it wide of cover. His weight was on the back foot and that made the single tricky. A direct-hit and Sarfraz might as well have kept running to the dressing room
PAKISTAN:10.5 Herath to U Akmal, 1 run, teased up and sliding on towards the stumps, nudged down to long-on
PAKISTAN:10.4 Herath to Sarfraz, 1 run, slower through the air and pushed with the turn wide of cover
PAKISTAN:10.3 Herath to Sarfraz, no run, fires in a quicker ball on leg, gets it to straighten enough to take a thick leading edge as Sarfraz tries to work it through the on-side, rolls towards backward point
PAKISTAN:10.2 Herath to Sarfraz, FOUR, now he gets close to the ball after dancing down and whips it wide of long-on. No risk of playing against the turn as he got to the pitch
PAKISTAN:10.1 Herath to Sarfraz, FOUR, really good shot. The thing about it was how he went through. Herath pulled it back cleverly seeing Sarfraz come down but he didn't hold back on the drive despite not meeting the pitch and smeared it wide of a diving extra-cove
PAKISTAN:9.6 Chameera to Sarfraz, 1 run, good lines specially after the batsman has shuffled outside off. Gets behind this and runs it to third man. Off the toe-end perhaps and a single
PAKISTAN:9.5 Chameera to Sarfraz, 2 runs, Chameera goes a little fuller but Sarfraz stays back. Stays put and drives it through extra cover for a brace
PAKISTAN:9.4 Chameera to Sarfraz, no run, swing and a miss. Fullish ball jagging away, Sarfraz looked to flash it towards third man but the ball bounces a touch extra to beat him comprehensively
PAKISTAN:9.3 Chameera to U Akmal, 1 run, gets a baby stride out and drives this length ball on-the-up through covers
PAKISTAN:9.2 Chameera to Sarfraz, 1 run, length ball that's hurled wide enough for Sarfraz to free his arms. Crashed square of the wicket and another easy single
PAKISTAN:9.1 Chameera to U Akmal, 1 run, banged in outside off, Akmal stands tall and dabs it to third manDushmantha Chameera [1.0-0-16-0] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:8.6 Herath to Sarfraz, no run, the famous arm-ball. Skids back in, Sarfraz was back looking to tuck it into the leg-side. Loud appeal but the umpire reckoned that there was some bat. Not sure about thatNo slip now
PAKISTAN:8.5 Herath to U Akmal, 1 run, uses his feet and clips this slower delivery to deep mid wicket
PAKISTAN:8.4 Herath to U Akmal, no run, tossed up delivery, Akmal gets forward and defends it sanely
PAKISTAN:8.3 Herath to Sarfraz, 1 run, flighted delivery on leg-stump, Sarfraz swiveled on his knee looking to play the sweep fine, gloves it back to short fine to invite an appeal
PAKISTAN:8.2 Herath to U Akmal, 1 run, fraction short and Akmal turns the ball to deep mid wicket
PAKISTAN:8.1 Herath to U Akmal, no run, gets Akmal to come forward and defend this tossed up deliveryOne slip for Herath
PAKISTAN:7.6 Dilshan to U Akmal, 1 run, stands taller and punches this delivery through mid wicket. A lazy dive and that ball should have been stopped
PAKISTAN:7.5 Dilshan to Sarfraz, 1 run, shuffles and nudges it round the corner for a single to deep square leg
PAKISTAN:7.4 Dilshan to Sarfraz, no run, comes down the track and pushed it to the right of Dilshan who dived to stop
PAKISTAN:7.3 Dilshan to Sarfraz, no run, this one goes across with the angle and stays low. Just about shaves the off-stump. Sarfraz this time played for the turn and was beaten on the outside edge
PAKISTAN:7.2 Dilshan to U Akmal, leg byes, 1 run, was there an inside edge? Given as leg byes. Straightens off the pitch, Umar was forward to play it straight, played outside the line and is rapped on the pads. Going down leg?Umar Akmal, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:7.1 Dilshan to Sharjeel Khan, out Caught by Kapugedera!! Take note. It's Dilshan's day. Meets his form courtesy two dropped catches and then strikes first ball. Dragged down delivery as a warm-up, Sharjeel made room and looked to pull. The ball slid on quickly and he ended up flat-batting it. Mistimed and straight to the fielder at long-on. As simple as that. Sharjeel Khan c Kapugedera b Dilshan 31(24) [4s-5 6s-1]Dilshan to Sharjeel Khan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Tillakaratne Dilshan, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:6.6 Herath to Sharjeel Khan, 1 run, slower delivery this time. Full toss alright but Sharjeel couldn't do anything. Pushes it to long-off post a shuffle and retains the strike with that run
PAKISTAN:6.5 Herath to Sarfraz, 1 run, hint of width and tapped deftly to cover for another single
PAKISTAN:6.4 Herath to Sharjeel Khan, 1 run, flatter and heaved uppishly to long-on
PAKISTAN:6.3 Herath to Sharjeel Khan, FOUR, that was a mere bat swing. Just a touch dragged down, Sharjeel stayed on his back foot and lifted it with a swivel over mid-wicket. Rushes to the boundaries
PAKISTAN:6.2 Herath to Sarfraz, 1 run, shuffles across and finds Herath following him on leg-stump, ends up pushing the ball through mid-on
PAKISTAN:6.1 Herath to Sarfraz, no run, dragged down and that's been crashed straight to cover-pointRangana Herath, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:5.6 Chameera to Sharjeel Khan, FOUR, fullish ball wide of off, Sharjeel reaches out and flashes it through deep backward point. Third man was too wide and too human to run across and cut it off. Four consecutive boundaries in a row!
PAKISTAN:5.5 Chameera to Sharjeel Khan, FOUR, this is lovely. Gets hold of this length ball on the stumps and clubs it over mid-wicket for a lovely boundary
PAKISTAN:5.4 Chameera to Sharjeel Khan, FOUR, that was sloppy from Siriwardana. Got himself behind the line of this ball but couldn't close his legs. Lets it burst through and it scoots into the fences at deep square leg. Shortish ball that was pulled off the inside half, uppishly and it runs through
PAKISTAN:5.3 Chameera to Sharjeel Khan, FOUR, length ball on off, Sharjeel gets his bat flowing. Looked to go big over long-on but didn't wood it as well as he would have liked. Off the higher part of the bat and a half-deliberate chip that bounces just inside the ropes
PAKISTAN:5.2 Chameera to Sharjeel Khan, no run, just back of a length outside off, Sharjeel swivels and pulls it along the carpet to mid-wicket. Looked dragged off the inner half that
PAKISTAN:5.1 Chameera to Sharjeel Khan, no run, on a length and wide, lots of bounce on this one. Sharjeel looks to crash - extends arms to reach that but fails to fetchDushmantha Chameera, right-arm fast, comes into the attackThe pace battery is here..nearly accounts for the entire Sri Lankan team. No slip
PAKISTAN:4.6 Dasun Shanaka to Sarfraz, no run, pitched up and moving away outside off, Sarfraz is lured into a drive. Doesn't cover for the swing and is beaten
PAKISTAN:4.5 Dasun Shanaka to Sharjeel Khan, 1 run, good from Perera at mid-on. dives full-length to his right and stops a certain four. This was another full ball on middle, Sharjeel had shuffled to drive it with a slightly closed bat face, couldn't place it wide of Perera there
PAKISTAN:4.4 Dasun Shanaka to Sharjeel Khan, no run, another very full ball, Sharjeel squeezes it out into the off-side. Looked well-timed but straight to one of the off-ring men
PAKISTAN:4.3 Dasun Shanaka to Sharjeel Khan, no run, yorker length on off, Sharjeel stays his ground and pushes it back to Dasun Shanaka

PAKISTAN:4.1 Dasun Shanaka to Sarfraz, FOUR, fullish ball but thrusted with lots of width, Sarfraz reaches out and just taps it with a near horizontal bat. Through extra cover, Chandimal dived to save but ended up taking the ball with him over the ropesDasun Shanaka, right-arm medium, comes into the attackJust one slipPakistan need 123...Until Malik perishes, there's always hope for Pakistan
PAKISTAN:3.6 Jayasuriya to Sharjeel Khan, no run, slower and angled in full on middle, Sharjeel just bunts it back

PAKISTAN:3.3 Jayasuriya to Hafeez, out Caught&Bowled!! Falls to a circus. Shimmies down but shows his cards too early. Jayasuriya drops it shorter, the ball sticks in the pitch and Hafeez ends up tamely tapping it back with a high bat. Jayasuriya protracts his hands and reverse-cups it nonchalantly over his head post a little shuffle to his left. First blood for Sri Lanka. Hafeez c and b Jayasuriya 14(11) [4s-3]Jayasuriya to Hafeez, THAT'S OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!
PAKISTAN:3.2 Jayasuriya to Hafeez, FOUR, still the width but flatter this time, Hafeez fetches it with a forward stride and sweeps. No intention to keep it down and it runs uppishly over backward square leg
PAKISTAN:3.1 Jayasuriya to Hafeez, FOUR, that's a warm-up pie. Dragged down and mediocred with width, Hafeez rocks back and cuts it through backward pointShehan Jayasuriya, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:2.6 Kulasekara to Sharjeel Khan, no run, but for the inside edge, that looked plumb! Kulasekara cleverly goes fuller seeing a flat-footed Sharjeel Khan. Straight line, Sharjeel looks to keep it out but just manages a big inside edge. All safe for now
PAKISTAN:2.5 Kulasekara to Sharjeel Khan, no run, fullish and ducking out outside off. The away angle helps the ball beat the outside edge as Sharjeel Khan looked to drive
PAKISTAN:2.4 Kulasekara to Sharjeel Khan, no run, full and straight, skids off the turf and Sharjeel is struck on the pad as he looked to tickle it into the leg-side
PAKISTAN:2.3 Kulasekara to Hafeez, 1 run, edged but it's wide of the lone slipper. Looked to punch off the back foot, forgets about the feet and ekes out an outside edge. Uppish through where a second slip would have been
PAKISTAN:2.2 Kulasekara to Hafeez, no run, goes fuller and nips in again, Hafeez is again struck - this time low on his left pad off the inside edge
PAKISTAN:2.1 Kulasekara to Hafeez, no run, plenty of nip and bounce on this length delivery, Hafeez was looking to turn it round the corner but is struck high on his right thigh pad
PAKISTAN:1.6 T Perera to Sharjeel Khan, SIX, now that's a pick up! Forget about Amazon returns. Hauls his front leg in the air, picks this length ball on leg-stump and swivels as he flicks this all the way. Over backward square leg, comfortably
PAKISTAN:1.5 T Perera to Hafeez, 1 run, looks to heave this length ball on off across the line, dragged off the inside edge and it runs to backward square leg
PAKISTAN:1.4 T Perera to Hafeez, no run, had an iota of a width to free arms and he does. But crashed straight to backward point
PAKISTAN:1.3 T Perera to Hafeez, no run, taps this length ball to cover-point defensively
PAKISTAN:1.2 T Perera to Hafeez, no run, length delivery jagging away a touch, Hafeez looked to defend off an open blade. Off the outside half and in front of backward point
PAKISTAN:1.2 T Perera to Hafeez, wide, compensates with a full ball but hurls it wide. The movement away makes it worse and it's been called rightly
PAKISTAN:1.1 T Perera to Hafeez, FOUR, that was timed. Pure timing. Back of a length ball, Hafeez stands taller, opens the face of the bat on the punch and creams it wide of backward point. Scoots awayThisara Perera, right-arm medium, comes into the attackFrugal but a sane start. Thisara now since we don't have Mathews tonight. 2 slips again
PAKISTAN:0.6 Kulasekara to Sharjeel Khan, no run, this one's on similar length again, Sharjeel flat-bats it. The ball looked to have held onto the pitch and Sharjeel ended up tapping it uppishly in front of mid-off
PAKISTAN:0.5 Kulasekara to Sharjeel Khan, no run, lovely bowling this. Gets this to curl away again, this time from back of a length. Sharjeel was looking to poke, had his bat hung to drive perhaps and saw the ball go past the edge
PAKISTAN:0.4 Kulasekara to Sharjeel Khan, no run, straightens his elbows on a wide short of length delivery moving away further, beats the toe-end
PAKISTAN:0.3 Kulasekara to Sharjeel Khan, no run, gets this to come back in, on leg-stump and Sharjeel was rapped on the pads. Stifled appeal but clearly down leg
PAKISTAN:0.2 Kulasekara to Sharjeel Khan, 2 runs, good effort in the deep. Shanaka dives at deep point to hurl the ball in, ends up parrying it away and then recovers quickly to throw it back in. Width on offer and Sharjeel cut it fiercely
PAKISTAN:0.1 Kulasekara to Sharjeel Khan, no run, lovely curl from over the wicket. Fullish length and moving away, Sharjeel has a poke and is beaten first ballSharjeel Khan and Hafeez are at the crease. Sharjeel Khan is on strike. Kulasekara will open the attackThe players are out, finally! Kulasekara is on top of his mark, 2 slips"My form will benefit the Sri Lankan team in the World T20," says Dilshan. And with that, it's nearly time for the chase. The Sri Lankan innings was defused before it could threaten but 150 can be overwhelming for Pakistan, especially after the India dry wash and the Bangladesh thumping. Tonight's chase should be interesting for two reasons: firstly Pakistan will be attempting it and secondly, they have chosen to do so.Sri Lankan top order chose the last round-robin clash, which happened to be a dead-rubber, to come out all guns blazing. But as they say 'better late than never!' Of course, the pitch was a belter which helped their cause, but Pakistani bowlers are no pushovers. Dilshan found it tough to get his timing right in the beginning but Mohammad Nawaz's first over - 6th of the innings - provided the impetus he needed as Dilshan amassed 18 runs off it. Captain Chandimal, on the other hand, used his feet well against the spinners and paced his innings well. None of the Pakistani bowlers, except Mohammad Amir in the first over looked menacing. The wickets that Sri Lanka lost were propelled by death over recklessness coupled with some smart bowling from Mohammad Irfan during the fag end of the innings. Having put 110 on the board in less than 15 overs with 9 wickets in hand, Sri Lanka would have expected a few more than what they got. Nonetheless, they have enough to push Pakistan into a corner. The result here will have no impact on the tournament but it will definitely impact the morale of both teams before the all-important World T20. Considering this, the chase is expected to be a thriller, join us in a while.1
SRI LANKA:19.6 Riaz to Siriwardana, 2 runs, the slower fullish delivery outside off, Siriwardana slices the drive through cover, could fetch a very useful double and Sri Lanka, surely, would be pleased with the target
SRI LANKA:19.5 Riaz to Dilshan, 1 run, pacy short delivery on the stumps, Dilshan half-turns and pulls it through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:19.4 Riaz to Siriwardana, 1 run, leant on the back foot and chopped this back of a length delivery back towards the bowler, Riaz sprints forward but decides not to fling the ball at the stumps. Dilshan wasn't too quick and a direct hit would have been interesting
SRI LANKA:19.3 Riaz to Dilshan, 1 run, short and around off, Dilshan was early into the leg-side slog, off the toe-end and towards mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:19.2 Riaz to Dilshan, FOUR, shot! Backed away a tad and used the room on offer, cut the short ball uppishly over backward point, third man had a lot of ground to cover and he couldn't get there in time
SRI LANKA:19.1 Riaz to Dilshan, no run, back of a length outside off, might have probably been the slower ball, Dilshan slogs but fails to put bat to ballWahab Riaz [3.0-0-21-1] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:18.6 Amir to Dilshan, 1 run, another full toss at the stumps, Dilshan slogs it to square leg and keeps the strike
SRI LANKA:18.5 Amir to Dilshan, 2 runs, low full toss, Dilshan smashes it to the left of mid-off who dives and stops well. Riaz though was a bit lazy as he assumed it to be a single. Was a smidgen late to hurl the ball back and Dilshan ain't missing out on any extra runs
SRI LANKA:18.4 Amir to Dilshan, 2 runs, Mohammad Irfan, what have you done? It's the second dropped catch today. He unfortunately, is the culprit on both occasions. The umpires are checking whether or not it was a boundary and seems like Irfan might have saved a couple of runs there. It was full and Dilshan went for the slog. The leading-edge sailed towards third man where Irfan made a meal of it. Was uncertain to stay back or to go forward. He comes forward and then backtracks and sticks out his left hand, the ball thuds him on the palm and rolled over his arm, just managed to save a double
SRI LANKA:18.4 Amir to Dilshan, wide, full and nipped away late, all that wide of the tramline as Dilshan came down the track and left that alone
SRI LANKA:18.3 Amir to Dilshan, 2 runs, bouncer darted in at the batsman, Dilshan swivels and miscues the pull towards deep square leg, a double nevertheless
SRI LANKA:18.2 Amir to Dilshan, 2 runs, low full toss around off, Dilshan muscles it wide of long-on
SRI LANKA:18.1 Amir to Dilshan, FOUR, hooo! How about that? Can someone name that? That wasn't a DILSCOOP but Dean Jones reckons it's a REVERSE DILSCOOP. Some width on offer and Dilshan scoops it over short third man after moving a long way acrossThree wickets in the last 3 overs... Dilshan will be the key from here on..
SRI LANKA:17.6 Irfan to Siriwardana, no run, 142kph full ball almost shaving the off-stump, Siriwardana backs away and tries to carve it square on the off-side, misses and the ball missed the off-stump by a whisker
SRI LANKA:17.5 Irfan to Dilshan, 1 run, slower ball hurled in around off, Dilshan makes some room and taps it towards backward point
SRI LANKA:17.4 Irfan to Siriwardana, 1 run, full toss outside off, Siriwardana opens the bat face and runs it down to third manMilinda Siriwardana, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:17.3 Irfan to Dasun Shanaka, out Bowled!! And again! This time it's the off-stump's turn. The slower ball from Irfan, Shanaka was too early into the slog. Went down on one knee and tried to smite that over mid-wicket but was beaten for the lack of pace. Misses the swing and off-stump is pegged back. Dasun Shanaka b Irfan 0(2)Irfan to Dasun Shanaka, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!

SRI LANKA:17.1 Irfan to Kapugedera, out Bowled!! There is something with this round the wicket ploy. Mohammad Irfan, the giant gets his name in the wickets column. What better sight than knocking the middle stump. It was angled in on a good length and Kapugedera exposed all his stumps to play a rash stroke through the leg-side. Missed it by a country mile and the middle-peg takes the beating. Kapugedera b Irfan 2(3)Irfan to Kapugedera, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Mohammad Irfan [3.0-0-16-0] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:16.4 Amir to Dilshan, FOUR, oh! Nawaz. He is having such a poor day on the field. First with the ball and now on the field. It was flicked from middle stump and the fielder from fine leg dived full length to his left, the knee got stuck while doing so and he couldn't recover in time
SRI LANKA:16.3 Amir to Dilshan, no run, a swing and a miss! Back of a length outside off, beats the bashing blade of Dilshan
SRI LANKA:16.2 Amir to Kapugedera, 1 run, at the hip, Kapugedera short-arm jabs it down to fine leg
SRI LANKA:16.1 Amir to Dilshan, 1 run, well! Dilshan gets to his fifty! How important a knock is this for him? I'm sure it will do a world of good for the veteran. Short and just outside off, Dilshan looks to pull, does so awkwardly. Gets a thick top-edge which flies down to fine leg. The dugout seem relieved and Dilshan must be too...Mohammad Amir [2.0-0-9-0] is back into the attackChamara Kapugedera, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:15.6 Shoaib Malik to Jayasuriya, out Caught by Sharjeel Khan!! Holed out to long-off! It was flatter and outside off, Jayasuriya shows up his inexperience, looks to mow it over long-off sans any feet movement. Ends up hitting it straight down the throat of Sharjeel Khan who accepts it gleefully. Was a mistimed stroke, didn't have enough power too. Jayasuriya c Sharjeel Khan b Shoaib Malik 4(6)Shoaib Malik to Jayasuriya, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:15.5 Shoaib Malik to Jayasuriya, no run, jumps down the pitch to show some intent, but Shoaib Malik dragged it a bit short, cramped for room and Jayasuriya ended up playing all around it, hit the bat, then pad
SRI LANKA:15.4 Shoaib Malik to Dilshan, 1 run, low full toss outside off, Dilshan reaches out for the drive and a fumble at extra cover meant Dilshan got through for a quick single
SRI LANKA:15.3 Shoaib Malik to Jayasuriya, 1 run, came in with the arm, Jayasuriya dropped it towards the on-side, hit high on the bat but he is content with a quick single

Tried to grab a second run but was sent backShoaib Malik, right-arm off break, comes into the attackSo, 5 more overs left. How many will Sri Lanka get? 170-180 perhaps.. Malik trundles in now...No slips
SRI LANKA:14.6 Riaz to Dilshan, no run, 145ks short ball around off, Dilshan was late on the pull, beaten for pace
SRI LANKA:14.5 Riaz to Dilshan, no run, another slower short ball that rose extra, Dilshan's feet was going nowhere, tried to flay that behind square but was beaten by the extra bounce
SRI LANKA:14.4 Riaz to Jayasuriya, 1 run, just waited inside the crease and glided this short of length delivery down to third man
SRI LANKA:14.3 Riaz to Dilshan, 1 run, Dilshan was trying to go hard through the off-side, it was slower and angled in, ends up getting a toe-end towards mid-on, a quick single stolen nonetheless
SRI LANKA:14.2 Riaz to Jayasuriya, 1 run, full and aiming for off, Jayasuriya seeks to drive but gets a soft outside edge which rolls down to short third manShehan Jayasuriya, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:14.1 Riaz to Chandimal, out Caught by Sharjeel Khan!! Finally a wicket! Against the run of play but Pakistan needed this badly, didn't they? It was a slower short ball slung in at the batsman, Chandimal stays back and drags the pull. Flew low to mid-wicket who half-bends and takes a fine catch. He fetched the pull from outside off and hence could only find the bottom of the bat. Chandimal c Sharjeel Khan b Riaz 58(49) [4s-7 6s-1]Riaz to Chandimal, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Wahab Riaz [2.0-0-18-0] is back into the attackRiaz from round the wicket
SRI LANKA:13.6 Mohammad Nawaz to Dilshan, FOUR, agricultural swipe! Picked the (full on leg-stump) length of this delivery early and swept it with utter disdain, scorched off the turf and raced away to the deep backward square fence
SRI LANKA:13.5 Mohammad Nawaz to Dilshan, no run, Dilshan misses out on a freebie! It was a full toss and had Dilshan stayed in his normal stance he might have butchered that. But what does he do? Reverses his stance and aims for a slog sweep, missed it altogether and is slammed on the pad. A mild appeal but ignored. That was missing leg by some distance
SRI LANKA:13.4 Mohammad Nawaz to Dilshan, no run, optimistic appeal from Sarfraz and Mohammad Nawaz. It was drifted down leg and Dilshan missed the sweep, rapped on the pads but would have clearly missed leg
SRI LANKA:13.3 Mohammad Nawaz to Dilshan, 2 runs, allows the ball to slide in and then tucks it with soft hands through square leg, good sensible batting this
SRI LANKA:13.2 Mohammad Nawaz to Chandimal, 1 run, skips out and flicks this through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:13.1 Mohammad Nawaz to Chandimal, SIX, 100 up for Sri Lanka! That's the shot of the night for me. Mohammad Nawaz is being taken to the cleaners today. It was flatter on middle, Chandimal jumped down the track, got to the pitch of the ball and smoked it back over the bowler's headMohammad Nawaz [2.0-0-25-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:12.6 Irfan to Dilshan, FOUR, please help-me delivery, sprayed down leg and Dilshan has murdered the pull wide of fine leg, no point chasing that lads!
SRI LANKA:12.5 Irfan to Chandimal, 1 run, in his zone, width on offer, Chandimal clobbered it off the middle but Afridi at extra cover dives to his right and stops a certain boundary
SRI LANKA:12.4 Irfan to Chandimal, no run, that looked ugly! Chandimal moved a long way across the stumps and tried to shovel this fullish delivery over short fine. Gets some edge on that and the ball grazes his helmet before it rolled away towards the keeper

SRI LANKA:10.6 Riaz to Dilshan, FOUR, that's Dilshan at his very best. Cutting and driving the ball at will. Riaz has been guilty of bowling short this over. Another slower short ball and asking to be punished, Dilshan flays the square drive behind backward and jeez! that raced away like a tracer bullet - RAVI SHAZ-esque
SRI LANKA:10.5 Riaz to Dilshan, 2 runs, short and Dilshan pulled it nonchalantly through mid-wicket. The fielder at deep mid-wicket could have done better, there was never a two but the batsmen made full use of the sloppinessBack to over the wicket again
SRI LANKA:10.4 Riaz to Chandimal, 1 run, off-pace delivery, angled in on middle, Chandimal drops it into the leg-side and hustles for a quick singleRiaz comes round the wicket now...
SRI LANKA:10.3 Riaz to Chandimal, FOUR, that's arrogance. Almost like telling the bowler I don't like you bowling at me. Just stand and spank the ball mantra from Chandimal. Cleared his front leg and belted this shortish ball through cover, raced away!
SRI LANKA:10.2 Riaz to Chandimal, FOUR, top-edge and a boundary. Was a bit short and Chandimal backed away to play the flat-bat slap. Got a thick top-edge which flew down to the third man fence

SRI LANKA:8.3 Riaz to Chandimal, no run, waits for this one by staying leg-side of the delivery, pats it in front of cover and wants a single, decides against it belatedly
SRI LANKA:8.2 Riaz to Chandimal, 2 runs, that is a good looking shot from Chandimal, waited for this one, bent back and opened the face of the bat to send it down to third man, good effort from Sharjeel Khan saved two runs for his team

SRI LANKA:5.3 Mohammad Nawaz to Dilshan, FOUR, third one and this is probably the best of all, got too close but still whacked it straight past the bowler, you cannot set a field for those

SRI LANKA:4.4 Afridi to Dilshan, 1 run, he had the longest arms on the field and that helped Irfan get to it, but then his size did not allow him to keep the balance and he dropped it, it was a flatter delivery and Dilshan swept at it, the top edge flew high towards short fine leg, Irfan ran back, stuck out his hands, got both of them to it but could not cling onto it, Dilshan survives
SRI LANKA:4.3 Afridi to Dilshan, no run, quicker and shortish, Dilshan wants to nudge it away into the on-side, wears on his pad off the inside edge
SRI LANKA:4.2 Afridi to Chandimal, 1 run, flatter again, eased down to long-off for another run

SRI LANKA:3.6 Irfan to Chandimal, FOUR, half-volley outside off and Chandimal needs those to get going, absolutely whacked it through the cover region, no need to run for those
SRI LANKA:3.5 Irfan to Chandimal, no run, bouncer and well above Chandimal's head, he attempts the ramp shot but does not connect with it
SRI LANKA:3.4 Irfan to Dilshan, 1 run, similar delivery, this time Dilshan covers for the line and defends in front of cover, a direct hit at the bowler's end would have been close. In fact, Dilshan was short of the crease there

Chandimal is on strike. Amir will open the attackThere is decent enough crowd and this despite the home team not playing in a dead rubber. Guess, this is Bangladesh's idea of enjoying the weekend. After all any cricket is good cricket.So a dead-rubber in every sort but the last memory of a tournament lingers for long and both teams would want it to be a sweet one. Afridi said at the toss that he wants to go home with a win and Chandimal's unit is 'looking forward' to it. Will both these teams produce a thriller or will it be tough for them to remain motivated? Next three and a half hours will tell us the complete story. Get yourself some coffee, live action coming your way in moments from now.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Sharjeel Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi(c), Iftikhar Ahmed, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad IrfanSri Lanka (Playing XI): Dinesh Chandimal(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Shehan Jayasuriya, Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Niroshan Dickwella(w), Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dushmantha Chameera, Rangana HerathChandimal: "Mathews has a calf strain, unfortunately he misses out. We had some chat last night and we want to come back strongly, we are looking forward to it. We have made only one change, Angelo is out and Dickwella comes in for him."Afridi: "We will be bowling first. If you compare with the last game, the pitch looks similar. There will be dew later so we are bowling first. It is not easy to recover from the loss in the last game, but you cannot live in the past. At least, this victory is important before the World Cup (World T20). We have made three changes. Anwar Ali, Khurram Manzoor and Mohammad Sami are resting, Mohammad Nawaz, Wahab Riaz and Iftikhar Ahmed are playing."Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch report: "The wicket looks very, very good. Just a little batter friendly. There's some rolled-in grass, but the spinners might come into play. I am not sure if you would want to bat first on this wicket," reckons Matthew Hayden.Their opponents, Sri Lanka, are also sailing in a similar boat. Just like Pakistan, their only victory in this Asia Cup has come against the laggards UAE. With Lasith Malinga out of action due to a knee injury, the bowling has lacked the teeth. To make matters worse, Nuwan Kulasekara seems to have lost the ability to generate prodigious inswing. Among the batsmen, only Dinesh Chandimal has cracked a fifty. With this being a dead-rubber, there is a chance that Jeffrey Vandersay might play. For Pakistan, the duo of Imad Wasim and Mohammad Nawaz can get a look in. Join us in a while for the toss and teams...Only Mohammad Amir, with his three-card trick, has brilliantly hoodwinked batsmen. He has created maximum backward rotation on the ball to generate late swing. Rest of them though, have largely failed to stamp their authority. In particular, Waqar Younis and his coaching staff will hope that the batsmen can get some runs under their belt before the World T20. Most of the batsmen have tried to go wham-bam against the new ball, in rather trying conditions. Only Sarfraz Ahmed, Shoaib Malik and Umar Akmal have notched up useful scores.A couple of days ago, Bangladesh scrapped and willed their way to a memorable victory against Pakistan to send the raucous home crowd into a frenzy. As Bangladesh's fans savoured the thrills and spills of a high voltage contest, Pakistan's hopes of making it to the final of the Asia Cup was dashed. One of the traditional giants of Asian cricket, Pakistan, have looked bereft of confidence. Now they will take on another struggling side, Sri Lanka, where pride is at stake. Preview by Ganesh Chandrasekaran Pakistan and Sri Lanka - the traditional powerhouses in the subcontinent - face crises in the T20 format just ahead of the World T20 as they brace themselves to play out an inconsequential Asia Cup game on Friday (February 4) after failing to qualify for the final. Not many would have fancied this outcome at the start of the tournament.Both teams are unhappy about their performances so far and understandably so. Neither team has presented a fake front to brush away the results. On the contrary, both Waqar Younis and Angelo Mathews have expressed disappointment but laid the blame on themselves rather than external factors.There have been a few rough umpiring decisions going against both teams but if there has been one thing said about the officiating, it has been consistent - consistently below-par.As it stands, both teams will be trying to make the best out of the lone game remaining. Mathews has sought to put an end to the 'team in transition' excuse and has called for all the players to start performing. Lasith Malinga's injury has severely affected the team's fortunes in the format but more than his expertise with the ball, it is the lack of runs from the likes of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Mathews himself that is having an adverse effect on the team.With the pressure subsiding considerably, it could act as a release-point for some of them. Sri Lanka need their batting order to tick more than anything else. They will take some heart from the fact that the conditions have been bowling-friendly but it will be far from easy to turn their confidence around. This presents a last opportunity to provide a boost but it won't come easy against an in-form Pakistan bowling attack.Mohammad Amir has been, arguably, the best pace bowler in the tournament. The impact that he's had has been for all to witness.With ample support from Mohammad Irfan, Pakistan's bowling looks quite formidable. But having failed to defend against Bangladesh, they too will be feeling the pinch.The more worrying concerns for Waqar Younis was the repeated batting failures, particularly from the top-order. Waqar felt that the likes of Khurram Manzoor and Sharjeel Khan are still making their way back into the team and might have gone into a shell.The middle-order has fared considerably better in comparison. Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed and Umar Akmal have contributed on and off but Pakistan's batting has failed to click as a collective unit.Waqar has made it clear that Pakistan will be making some changes for the final game and Khalid Latif could get a look-in in place of Khurram Manzoor, who has endured a horrific run of form with the bat.Sri Lanka are unlikely to make changes to their combination. Mathews admitted that the batting line-up used for the previous game was the one they were looking to use right through the tournament. Dinesh Chandimal's role at the top of the order would be to take some time and set up the innings. He did well in two games but the batting came apart after that. Sri Lanka's problems lie much less with the planning as much as it does in execution. That is something that can be corrected only on the field.The conditions are unlikely to change drastically at the Shere Bangla stadium. Having played three games each, the teams will be quite familiar with what will be on offer. It is one last chance for both teams to gain some confidence and neither will want to let that slip.
