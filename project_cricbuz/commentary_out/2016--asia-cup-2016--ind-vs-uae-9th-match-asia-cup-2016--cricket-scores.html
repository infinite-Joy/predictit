INDIA:10.1 10.1Shahzad to Yuvraj, FOUR, India win by 9 wkts. A stroll, if that sums it up. Squeezed UAE in jar and then hosepiped to a win. Yuvraj, the old Yuvraj, gets a short ball, bends a touch and swats it with a crossed bat. Through backward square leg and it runs away to signal India's win and unchallenged supremac
INDIA:9.6 Rohan Mustafa to Yuvraj, 1 run, veering in with the angle and Yuvraj flicks it to backward square leg, retains the strike with that run
INDIA:9.5 Rohan Mustafa to Yuvraj, FOUR, sees Yuvraj charging in and drops it short. Yuvraj tries to defend and ekes out an outside edge that runs all the way to third manMankading attempt? At least threatened to. Rohan Mustafa came in, aborted the bowling and then shadow-flicked the stumps. Dhawan was backing up and hurried back in. Mustafa had a huge laugh. No Spirit of Cricket debate for tonight then..
INDIA:9.4 Rohan Mustafa to Yuvraj, no run, another use of the feet but sort of gets too close to this wide ball. Crashed straight to cover
INDIA:9.3 Rohan Mustafa to Dhawan, 1 run, slightly quicker and Dhawan nudges it through mid-off for the easiest of singles
INDIA:9.2 Rohan Mustafa to Dhawan, no run, slower delivery on yorker length outside off, Dhawan waits and then squeezes it out to cover
INDIA:9.1 Rohan Mustafa to Dhawan, no run, flatter on off, Shikhar gets forward and defends itRohan Mustafa, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
INDIA:8.6 Shahzad to Yuvraj, no run, opens his blade and defends to backward point
INDIA:8.5 Shahzad to Yuvraj, SIX, Dhaka is a time machine and we are back into the golden days. Delicate shimmy down the track and then a free-flowing bat lift to grease the ball over long-off. Meated all the way
INDIA:8.4 Shahzad to Yuvraj, no run, this has been punched into the off-side
INDIA:8.3 Shahzad to Yuvraj, FOUR, dismissed. The Yuvraj of old. Stands tall and pulls a short ball wide of mid-on. The fielder there late out a late hop to try catching the ball. That was for the captain and the coach. "See I tried"
INDIA:8.2 Shahzad to Yuvraj, no run, Shahzad has a wry smile because this was a peach. Length ball with a wobbly seam scissoring away from over the wicket, Yuvraj was opened up a touch as he looked to adjust for the nip away. Could only see it whoosh past the outside edge
INDIA:8.1 Shahzad to Yuvraj, no run, gets a length ball and Yuvraj totally mistimes the drive to mid-offMohammad Shahzad, right-arm medium, comes into the attack20 runs in 12 overs. Early finish?
INDIA:7.6 Qadeer Ahmed to Dhawan, FOUR, follows it up with a short ball and Dhawan has clubbed it. Qadeer Ahmed isn't Starc. Modest pace, sat up pretty and Dhawan swiped it uppishly through mid-wicket
INDIA:7.5 Qadeer Ahmed to Dhawan, FOUR, slower delivery angled across, Dhawan throws his bat at it post a shimmy. Has timed a few well to give himself that liberty. Off the outside edge and it runs through the vacant slips
INDIA:7.4 Qadeer Ahmed to Yuvraj, 1 run, UAE look lethargic enough to have allowed a couple there but the batsmen decide against it. Yuvraj allows the length ball to come right upto him and clips it to backward square leg
INDIA:7.3 Qadeer Ahmed to Dhawan, 1 run, Dhawan follows suit. Some width outside off and Dhawan meets it with a slightly open blade. Another quick single effected
INDIA:7.2 Qadeer Ahmed to Yuvraj, 1 run, opens the face of the bat on impact and pinches a quick single to cover-point
INDIA:7.1 Qadeer Ahmed to Yuvraj, FOUR, it's in your pizza. In your sandwiches and parathas. Yuvraj had "buttered" this through covers. Typical Yuvraj. Leans it and caresses this ball through coversPawan Negi is padded up next. Only fair
INDIA:6.6 Naveed to Dhawan, FOUR, finally gets enough on the ball and finds a plughole to collect a boundary. Not a full-blooded punch to this length ball..just a stab and the ball pings off the middle through extra cover
INDIA:6.5 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, backs away while skipping out and creams this full ball on leg-stump with a drive. Placement evades him and cover once again intercepts
INDIA:6.4 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, length outside off, Dhawan ignores this one with a bat airliftWant to propose a theory that the sum of timing-and-placement for Rohit and Shikhar is constant. What law should it be called?
INDIA:6.3 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, length delivery and that has been hit well. Stays his ground and crashes it, straight to cover though
INDIA:6.2 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, was looking to drive this through mid-off but the bat face closed and Dhawan mistimed it back to the bowler
INDIA:6.1 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, fullish and hurled out with the angle, Shikhar lifts his bat and lets it go
INDIA:5.6 Qadeer Ahmed to Yuvraj, no run, gets an overpitched delivery and Yuvraj lets out a drive. Stopped at extra cover by a diving AnwarYuvraj Singh, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:5.5 Qadeer Ahmed to Rohit, out Caught by Naveed!! This was all too much to take. Ironically perishes off a tripe ball. Short and wide, Rohit could have murdered it. Instead manages just a tame toe-end on the uppish cut and it settles nicely into the hands of third man who just had to wait for the ball to arrive. Rohit c Naveed b Qadeer Ahmed 39(28) [4s-7 6s-1]Qadeer Ahmed to Rohit, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:5.4 Qadeer Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, another one. Rohit Sharma had timing and placement for cereals this morning. Length ball, Sharma stays put and just mows it over mid-wicket. Are you surprised that it vroomed away?
INDIA:5.3 Qadeer Ahmed to Rohit, no run, speared on the pads again, Sharma this times nudges it round the corner
INDIA:5.2 Qadeer Ahmed to Rohit, no run, length ball that's defended back to Qadeer Ahmed
INDIA:5.1 Qadeer Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, difficult to describe. Imagine coming early to the office for one day and finding your boss appreciate your punctuality. That sort of timing. On the pads, Sharma just clipped it. Swear it was just that. Off the middle and it races away. What's with that bat? Or is it Rohit Sharma?Qadeer Ahmed, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:4.6 Naveed to Rohit, 1 run, okay. He has compensated it with a yorker right at the base of the stumps. A helpless Rohit could only squeeze it out into the off-side. Top ball
INDIA:4.6 Naveed to Rohit, no ball, and that's a cardinal sin. That's almsgiving. That's Missionaries of Charities. Short of length, Sharma spooned the defence uppishly back as the ball hugged the pitch and stopped on the batsman. Naveed though had overstepped. Free-hit coming!
INDIA:4.5 Naveed to Rohit, no run, that was crunched. No hyperbole. Slides back and punches this ball straight to mid-off
INDIA:4.4 Naveed to Rohit, no run, gets the short ball again and tries to pull off a Nataraja. Hauls his front leg in air, swivels but looked a bit cramped for the pull. Mistimed to square leg
INDIA:4.3 Naveed to Rohit, FOUR, short of length outside off, Sharma opens the face of the bat ever so late. Rode the bounce well too and steered it wide of the lone slipper
INDIA:4.2 Naveed to Rohit, FOUR, that's audacious. Short ball? Alright. Stays back, gets his bat high and swipes the air as he pulls over mid-wicket. One bounce over the ropes. Try thinking a delicate axing and you can picturize this shot
INDIA:4.1 Naveed to Dhawan, 1 run, leg-stumpish line, Dhawan lets out a "phew" and clips a quick single to square leg
INDIA:3.6 Amjad Javed to Rohit, no run, a walking defence offered with a straight ball. Kept out
INDIA:3.5 Amjad Javed to Rohit, FOUR, tries to cramp him for room, hurls it on the pad and Sharma gets his Zephyr-like wrists into play. Bends and times the pants off that flick through mid-wicket
INDIA:3.4 Amjad Javed to Rohit, SIX, let me describe it. This was like Donald Trump's POTUS candidacy. A bit outrageous. Skips down the track and lofts this disdainfully over the covers
INDIA:3.3 Amjad Javed to Rohit, FOUR, that's a Rohit Sharma drive in a back gear. No feet, just leans to drive this fullish ball. Off the inside edge and perilously close to off-stump as it scoots to the fine leg fence
INDIA:3.2 Amjad Javed to Rohit, no run, gets his die-straight bat in front of his pad and defends this length ball back
INDIA:3.1 Amjad Javed to Rohit, 2 runs, veering down leg on a fuller length, Sharma got his bat low and crossed to pinch a flicked brace through mid-wicket
INDIA:2.6 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, that's why you have two slips. That's why you bowl to Dhawan. Back of a length and rising off the pitch, Dhawan looked to drive straight with feet in jelly. The away angle, the bounce and a hint of nip saw the ball climb past the edge
INDIA:2.5 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, nips in from a length, Dhawan was cramped and squeezed out the defence into the off-side
INDIA:2.4 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, nips in a touch and beats Dhawan's attempted flick to take the thigh pad
INDIA:2.3 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, wait, what? Such a convincing appeal from all around. Short of a length delivery zipping off the turf and powered with an angle across. Dhawan rose higher but perhaps eked out a top-edge on his tamely attempted slap. Umpire shakes his head and has a rather sheepish look. Replays confirm a top-edge
INDIA:2.3 Naveed to Dhawan, wide, overcompensates and hurls it outside the tramline on the off-side. Umpire has some cardio to do
INDIA:2.2 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, better have a short leg. Leg-stump line, Dhawan half-turns and nudges it round the corner
INDIA:2.1 Naveed to Dhawan, no run, too straight to entertain a relatively overpopulated slip cordon in a T20. On the pads and clipped to mid-wicketTwo slips. Even UAE know it all
INDIA:1.6 Amjad Javed to Dhawan, 1 run, here's the event that should keep you awake. Dhawan has tapped a length ball to mid-off and hared a single to open his account. Could really do with some runs, cheap or not, in his bank before the T20 bonanza
INDIA:1.5 Amjad Javed to Rohit, 1 run, something has happened. Full delivery moving away, Sharma leans to drive, middles it but the cover fielder is lazy - doesn't bend down enough and lets the ball through for a single
INDIA:1.4 Amjad Javed to Rohit, no run, just a hint of extra bounce on this back of a length delivery. Outside off, Sharma got his bat higher and taps it into the pitch
INDIA:1.3 Amjad Javed to Rohit, no run, high and straight bat to blunt this back of a length ball back to Amjad Javed
INDIA:1.2 Amjad Javed to Rohit, no run, back of a length outside off, Sharma gets his bat behind the line and defends it tamely to cover-point
INDIA:1.1 Amjad Javed to Rohit, no run, lovely fuller length from over the wicket, Sharma gets his bat lower and then eases the ball in front of mid-onAmjad Javed, right-arm medium, comes into the attackSane over and enough evidence for UAE to see with regards to what they could have done
INDIA:0.6 Naveed to Rohit, 1 run, there's a squarish third man in place and this Sharma's bat-throw of a shot finds the fielder
INDIA:0.5 Naveed to Rohit, no run, fullish and curving away outside off, Sharma shoulders arms. This looks like a safer length to delay the inevitable
INDIA:0.4 Naveed to Rohit, FOUR, and it's away! Had the width to stretch the arms on this length ball, Sharma stays put and flogs it delicately through covers. Nobody moved I reckon, except the ball
INDIA:0.3 Naveed to Rohit, no run, back of a length delivery this time, Sharma stands tall and punch-defends with an open blade
INDIA:0.2 Naveed to Rohit, no run, takes a step forward and across and greets this length ball with a bat-hoisting
INDIA:0.1 Naveed to Rohit, no run, lovely curl outside off, the wide line means that Sharma could shoulder armsRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. Naveed will open the attackNo circus from India. Rohit and Dhawan will open..One slip!And...we are back for the chase! It was not a hara-kiri out there; was a slow death with 9 wickets spread across 20 overs and the UAE resembled a hedgehog clasped in my palms. Understandable nerves but what needs to be appreciated is that they are here, crossing the qualification hurdles to earn a match-up against India and the other big guns.HOWZSTAT: The last time India played an international game against the UAE was during the 2015 World Cup (28 Feb' 2015) and Shaiman Anwar was the only one who looked like gettting some runs there. He scored 35 then and 43 now, meaning he is the leading run-scorer on both occasions.UAE spoiled a perfect script for India by opting to bat and how did India avenge that? By restricting them well below hundred. It all started with Bhuvneshwar Kumar drawing first blood, which opened the floodgates. UAE looked clueless against the Indian quicks first and later against the spinners. Their innings was all about ugly heaves and swings, which rightly resulted in wickets at regular intervals. Chastened by the spate of wicket-falls, the best plan for the minnows would have been to get a partnership in the middle. Instead, they tried to hit their way out of trouble. And as is the case often, the ploy did not work out well, precipitating 77 dot balls in the process. Though India wanted to bat first, they won't mind where they stand after the completion of 20 overs. Every bowler used today got at least a wicket and now it is the turn of the batsmen to go in and overwhelm the minuscule target. The only thing to look forward to in the next innings is whether India will shuffle the batting order? Chase in a while from now...1
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.6 Bhuvneshwar to Qadeer Ahmed, no run, and again! The bouncer on the stumps and Qadeer Ahmed ain't getting any bat on that. Missed it by a long wayQadeer Ahmed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.5 Bhuvneshwar to Ahmed Raza, out Shaiman Anwar Run Out!! Shaiman Anwar had to run and he ends up running himself out, but must say it was all for the team cause. Just imagine how disastrous a total would be sans the 43 of Shaiman Anwar. It was a bouncer and Raza was hurried for pace. Fails to connect with the big swing and they tried to steal a bye. Dhoni hits the bulls-eye and Shaiman Anwar wasn't even in the frame. Shaiman Anwar run out (Dhoni) 43(48) [4s-3 6s-1]Bhuvneshwar to Ahmed Raza, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.4 Bhuvneshwar to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, makes room and pulls this shortish delivery off the inside half through mid-wicket
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.3 Bhuvneshwar to Shaiman Anwar, no run, walks across the stumps and fails to flick this full delivery slung down the leg-side, could have been a wide had he stayed stillAhmed Raza, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.2 Bhuvneshwar to Naveed, out Caught by Negi!! UAE might not as well reach 100 here. Length delivery in the slot to be smacked away and Naveed had only so much power that he found the fielder to perfection. Hit it well but didn't get the elevation. Negi rushes forward from deep mid-wicket and accepts it gleefully. Naveed c Negi b Bhuvneshwar 5(7)Bhuvneshwar to Naveed, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:19.1 Bhuvneshwar to Naveed, no run, short ball over the stumps, Naveed backs away slightly and tries to pull it over square leg, was a fraction too early into the shot, beatenBhuvneshwar Kumar [3.0-2-7-1] is back into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.6 Bumrah to Shaiman Anwar, no run, yet again he tries to go big, over mid-wicket, cleared the front leg and the full ball dipped in to take his toe-end of the bat, the ball thuds him onto the back leg
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.5 Bumrah to Shaiman Anwar, no run, yorker outside off, Anwar moves across and fails to dig it out
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.4 Bumrah to Shaiman Anwar, SIX, this is much better. Stays still and slaps it back over the bowler's head. Kept his head still and ensured he connected it off the middle
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.3 Bumrah to Shaiman Anwar, no run, what was that Anwar? He shuffles a long way across the off-stump and looks to lap it over MSD. The length delivery kept low and went on with the inward angle to beat him
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.2 Bumrah to Naveed, 1 run, full and on the stumps, Naveed toe-ends the drive through cover
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:18.1 Bumrah to Naveed, 2 runs, backs away and slaps this length ball over a leaping mid-off. Dhawan was the fielder and he did well to backtrack and leap high, just beyond his reachJasprit Bumrah [3.0-0-14-1] is back into the attack
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.6 Yuvraj to Naveed, 1 run, turned this to square leg, a misfield and there was an easy two there but the batsmen don't take the risk
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.5 Yuvraj to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, is there a run-out again? NO, thankfully there isn't. Anwar punched this down to long-on and Naveed was too casual in his approach. Was just ambling like his early morning jog and nearly runs himself out. The throw came in quick and Dhoni appeals for the umpteenth time after dismissing the bails. Naveed was just in...
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.4 Yuvraj to Naveed, 1 run, shortish outside off, Naveed backs away and slaps it to long-off
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.3 Yuvraj to Naveed, no run, high full toss outside off, Naveed backs away and missed it by a long way

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.1 Yuvraj to Shaiman Anwar, no run, slows this up in the air and the ball dips right in front of the booming blade of Anwar, was looking to force it through the off-side but it hit the toe-end and went on the bounce to Dhoni who half-appeals
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.1 Yuvraj to Shaiman Anwar, wide, drifts this down leg and Anwar fails to sweepMohammad Naveed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.6 Negi to Fahad Tariq, out Fahad Tariq Run Out!! Absolute waste of a wicket. You expect these when associate teams play with professional teams (with all due respect to them). But what was Tariq trying to do there? He came down the track, mistimed the punch to the left of the bowler and was keen on a non-existent single. Negi ran across and flung the ball back to Dhoni who did the rest. Tariq was half-way down the pitch. Shaiman Anwar was never interested in the single. Fahad Tariq run out (Negi/Dhoni) 3(5)Negi to Fahad Tariq, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.5 Negi to Fahad Tariq, 2 runs, full and that's driven through extra cover for a brace
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.4 Negi to Fahad Tariq, no run, an action replay of the previous delivery and just that Tariq was more cautious this time
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.3 Negi to Fahad Tariq, no run, a loud appeal for stumping but nothing from the umpire this time. This was tossed up nicely outside off and Tariq was too early into the big shot. Missed it by a country mile and MS was too quick to whip the bails off. Tariq though was well inside
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.2 Negi to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, sliding in with the arm around off, Anwar backs away and drives off the toe-end, towards long-off
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:16.1 Negi to Fahad Tariq, 1 run, driven to sweeper cover
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.6 Yuvraj to Shaiman Anwar, no run, shortish on leg-stump, Anwar goes on the back foot and mistimed the pull towards mid-wicketFahad Tariq, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.5 Yuvraj to Muhammad Kaleem, out Caught by Pandya!! Crikey! What a catch. Hardik Pandya has pulled off a stunner. This was an ugly stroke from Muhammad Kaleem. The ball was flat and around the stumps, kept a bit low as well. Kaleem half-turns and goes for a big mow over mid-wicket. Mistimes it completely and Pandya from long-on sprints forward, dives full length and plucks it inches above the turf. Search it on YouTube folks! Muhammad Kaleem c Pandya b Yuvraj 2(10)Yuvraj to Muhammad Kaleem, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.4 Yuvraj to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, short and on the off-stump, Anwar slaps it to the left of long-off
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.3 Yuvraj to Shaiman Anwar, FOUR, short again and this time Anwar pounces on it. Jumped back and clobbered the ball through extra cover, got full value for the shot
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:15.2 Yuvraj to Shaiman Anwar, no run, short and wide, Anwar cuts and Rohit dives to his left to stop a certain boundary

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.5 Negi to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, wristed to long-on
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.4 Negi to Muhammad Kaleem, 1 run, tries to work this tossed up delivery through the leg-side. Gets a leading edge which dribbles through point
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.3 Negi to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, wanted to pull on seeing the length short instead mistimes it back to the bowler
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.2 Negi to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, jaffa! The classic left-arm spinner. Pitched on leg and turned away from the right-hander. Kaleem had no clue about that. Ended up playing all around that. It was close from shaving the bails...
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:14.1 Negi to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, short and wide, guided to backward point
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.6 Harbhajan to Muhammad Kaleem, 1 run, looks to flick this delivery spinning down leg, manages some inside edge onto his pad and it rollls down the leg-side
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.5 Harbhajan to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, wanted to drive this full ball through cover, ekes out an inside edge to mid-wicket
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.4 Harbhajan to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, floated up delivery, Kaleem works it to short mid-wicket
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.3 Harbhajan to Muhammad Kaleem, no run, this one turned in sharply and went right through the bat-pad gap. Kaleem was looking to force it through the on-side, with the turn. But was beaten by the late dip and Dhoni dislodges the bails in a flash. Kaleem lost his balance, only for a fleeting moment but managed to land his back leg in timeNow then! Is this out? Again an appeal for stumping and NOT OUT is the verdict. Kaleem just managed to land his back foot in time. When I say Just its really jussssssst. Good job from MS though..
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.3 Harbhajan to Muhammad Kaleem, wide, spinning down leg, Kaleem fails to glanceMuhammad Kaleem, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.2 Harbhajan to Amjad Javed, out Caught by Negi!! Bhajji gets a wicket too and isn't he delighted? Oh, yes! He is all smiles. This was slower and dipped right in front of the batsman. Javed leaned forward and flicked it a little too early. Again off the toe-end and Negi just had to move a few yards to his left at mid-wicket to pluck that. Amjad Javed c Negi b Harbhajan 0(1)Harbhajan to Amjad Javed, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:13.1 Harbhajan to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, rocks back and cuts this delivery from middle-stump, through cover and it's an easy single
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:12.6 Negi to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, eased down to long-offAmjad Javed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:12.5 Negi to Muhammad Usman, out Caught by Harbhajan!! First wicket for the debutant. What a moment! Someday he will look back at this replay and say: "You know what I've spun that ball a long way and the batsman couldn't pick the S of spin." Haha.. Fun apart. To be honest it was a flatter delivery around off, Usman came down the track and wanted to have a piece of it. Doesn't get to the pitch of the delivery and skews it off the toe-end. Bhajji had one of the easiest to grab at long-off and he doesn't miss many. Pats on the back and handshakes for the debutant. Muhammad Usman c Harbhajan b Negi 9(12) [4s-1]Negi to Muhammad Usman, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:12.4 Negi to Muhammad Usman, 2 runs, spinning in slightly around middle, Usman rocks back and cuts it to deep backward point where Bhuvi makes a diving stop, certainly saved 2 runs there

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:11.5 Harbhajan to Muhammad Usman, 1 run, stabbed to sweeper cover
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:11.4 Harbhajan to Muhammad Usman, no run, this one too spun and bounce. Usman was looking to sweep it through mid-wicket but was beaten by the dip and turn. Dhoni was quick to whip the bails off but Usman just got his foot back in. In fact, he almost twisted his ankle there as was desperately trying to make his ground. He was on the line for a while, but just managed to have something behind when the bails came offTV umpire is pressed into the action, for a stumping chance. Did Muhammad Usman get his back foot in? Looks like. He might have just dragged that foot back in time and NOT OUT flashes out on the giant screen - The right call has been made
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:11.3 Harbhajan to Muhammad Usman, no run, finally some turn and bounce for Bhajji! Pitched around off and spun away from a tentative poking blade, Usman was lazy on the front foot prod and jeez! The ball rose high so that MS had to hop and snaffle that

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.3 Pandya to Shaiman Anwar, 1 run, width offered on a shorter length and Anwar cuts it uppishly down to third man. This perhaps was the kind of shot he was trying to play on the first ball of this over
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.2 Pandya to Shaiman Anwar, no run, length delivery angled in on middle and off, pushed back to the bowler
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:10.1 Pandya to Shaiman Anwar, no run, oooooh! That just took off. Pandya pitched it short and in the corridor of uncertainty, the ball rose higher than Anwar expected. He was trying to cut that square on the off-side, beaten neck and crop. The feet were going nowhere..

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:8.5 Pandya to Muhammad Usman, no run, that is a top delivery from Pandya, shapes it away from Usman who he is beaten on the defensive pushMuhammad Usman, left handed bat, comes to the crease
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:8.4 Pandya to Rohan Mustafa, out Caught by Kohli!! Pandya comes round the wicket and keeps it short outside off, Mustafa does what he has been doing so far in the over, plays an ugly shot and will walk back leaving his team in shambles.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.3 Bumrah to Shahzad, out Caught by Raina!! That is a poor shot from Shahzad, was in no position to play the drive off the back foot. When the ball is swinging so much, you need to get yourself behind the line of the delivery but Shahzad had no intention of doing so, played it well away from the body and got a thick outside edge, Raina had the easiest of catches at second slip as he reverse cupped it in front of his face.

Rohan Mustafa is on strike. Bhuvneshwar will open the attackThe players have walked into the middle. Fielders are taking their positions. Players are wearing black arm-bands in memory of Martin Crowe. We are all set for the dead-rubber tie which will help India hone their skills before the all-important final on Sunday. Bhuvi has the new ball in his hand. Here we go...India have made three changes and after a long time we are going to see Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowl in a T20I for India, same goes for Harbhajan Singh who has been travelling with the team for sometime now but was not given a game. As far as Pawan Negi is concerned, the day is going to be etched in his memory forever. Well done young man, you have earned the India cap. A moment of silence is being observed by both teams in the memory of former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe who passed away earlier today.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Hardik Pandya, Pawan Negi, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit BumrahUnited Arab Emirates (Playing XI): Rohan Mustafa, Muhammad Kaleem, Mohammad Shahzad, Shaiman Anwar, Muhammad Usman, Amjad Javed(c), Swapnil Patil(w), Mohammad Naveed, Qadeer Ahmed, Fahad Tariq, Ahmed RazaMS Dhoni: "We wanted to bat first just in case we have to bat first in the final, other than that nothing changes. Slightly more grass than the last wicket. I do not think much has changed, bit of grass has been taken off. We have plenty of changes, Ashish Nehra, Ashwin and Jadeja have been rested. So, Bhuvi, Harbhajan and Pawan Negi come in."Amjad Javed: "We will bat first. I guess, it is the same wicket that we played against Pakistan, putting runs on the board and putting pressure while chasing will be good for us. Everything has gone well for us, we have produced some good matches. We will try that again today. Usman Mushtaq is out and Qadeer Ahmed is coming in."United Arab Emirates have won the toss and have opted to batTalking about the UAE - the kid who topped the class test but got horrible grades as he appeared for the semester exams. In the qualifiers, UAE ran through their opponents, getting the better of Afghanistan, who in recent times have been the most impressive of the associate nations. Having put up a great show, UAE were expected to challenge the bigger names in the main event. Instead, they turned out to be a bunch of deers caught in headlights. Their bowling did trouble the opponents but all the good work done by the bowlers was wasted by some ordinary batting. The Indian bowling might not be as express as Pakistan, who tormented them in their previous tie, but it boasts of variations. UAE will be better off by not focusing much on the might of the opponent. It will help them not get overawed and at the same time, ensure that they bring out their game face. They have nothing but pride to play for. Can UAE stage an upset? Toss, team updates, pitch report and live action to follow. We are getting the big news, BCCI have just tweeted that Pawan Negi will be making his debut todayDead rubbers are used for two purposes. First, the dominant team tests its bench strength and tries to iron-out issues, if any. In some cases, they stick with the winning eleven, but try different combinations in pursuit of having a fully war-tested team before their all-important game. Second, those players who have not been lucky enough to be amongst runs or wickets look to optimize the opportunity. So, will Harbhajan Singh get a chance to roll his arm over today? Will Pawan Negi don the India jersey for the first time or will Dhoni want to rest his back and handover the gloves to Parthiv Patel? As much as a fan would want India to try out these combinations, Dhoni is not expected to make many. We have seen in the past his inclination to not alter with the winning combination.If you still use Bangladesh and minnows in the same sentence, it is time to change that. Yesterday, they proved that - at least for now - they are one of the best T20I sides in Asia, pipping Pakistan to set up a date with India in the summit clash of the Asia Cup. Bangladesh's win has rendered the Sri Lanka vs Pakistan game - to be played on Friday - inconsequential. But before the battle for pride between Sri Lanka and Pakistan to be followed by the final hurrah between India and the hosts, it is time for a dead-rubber between the top team and the bottom placed side of the tourney. Hello and a warm welcome to all of you as India take on UAE tonight!Preview by Ganesh ChandrasekaranWith India having qualified for the final and UAE already knocked out, the last league game for both teams on Thursday (March 3) is a dead rubber. Even an upset from UAE is not going to cause any complications to the qualifications scenario. But the game could yet hold some significance. For UAE, it is their last and probably biggest shot at making people notice them. A good performance against an in-form India will do their cause a world of good. That this will be their last game in the limelight before heading back home ought to motivate Amjad Javed's men to a large extent.After winning all their games in the qualifiers, UAE have not managed to repeat a similar performance against the Test-playing nations in the Tournament Proper. The bowling attack has caught attention after good shows against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, but the batting has been a let-down. It will take some doing to reverse the trend against an in-form Indian bowling attack.Although what might help is that Dhoni was certain on making some changes for the upcoming games. The skipper made it clear after the match against Sri Lanka that India will be looking to give a few players on the bench an opportunity. The possible changes are anybody's guess. Ashish Nehra has been a pillar of the bowling attack since he made his comeback to the team. However, his history of injuries might just force the team-management to give him a bit of rest ahead of the World T20. There wouldn't be many chances to do that once the tournament begins and this could be their last chance to give someone like Bhuvneshwar Kumar some match-time.The other possible change would be to get in Pawan Negi for Ravindra Jadeja. That would be a like-for-like replacement in terms of roles played. Negi is part of the World T20 squad as well. But this might be the ideal time to give him a debut. Unless injuries force him to, Dhoni is unlikely to tinker with the batting order too much. Yuvraj Singh has been slowly finding his feet back in the national team and this would present another opportunity for him to get ticking. It will also be interesting to see if Harbhajan Singh gets a look-in. That would mean Dhoni missing out on three of his front-line bowlers and both of his first-choice spinners.It will be India's last game before the final and while the threat of an upset remains meagre, it will be a huge dent to their confidence and momentum if they do slip-up. Given that pretty much the same squad has figured in their last nine games, the threat of complacency seeping in also rings true. The challenge for Dhoni and Co. is to approach the game without letting up on intensity despite the game lacking any context.On the other hand, UAE will have their shirts rolled up to give it one last shot. A team made up of mostly expats from India and Pakistan, this is an opportunity to make the biggest impact they could create. The enormity of the chance will not slip by them. Skipper Javed has been in the forefront of a well-toned bowling unit that restricted the likes of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to scores around the 130s. The lack of batting fire-power is an issue that probably cannot be addressed immediately given the lack of stocks left in the reserve.The pitch might not be a cause of concern for both teams but the conditions might. With the dew-factor coming into play in the game against Sri Lanka, the toss could well be a crucial factor in the game. The teams batting second will have a slightly enhanced advantage once the ball stops swinging. But it is expected to assist the seamers nevertheless, as has been the case all through the tournament.Teams:United Arab Emirates (From): Rohan Mustafa, Muhammad Kaleem, Mohammad Shahzad, Shaiman Anwar, Usman Mushtaq, Muhammad Usman, Amjad Javed(c), Swapnil Patil(w), Mohammad Naveed, Fahad Tariq, Ahmed Raza, Qadeer Ahmed, Farhan Ahmed, Zaheer Maqsood, Saqlain HaiderIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashish Nehra, Jasprit Bumrah, Ajinkya Rahane, Harbhajan Singh, Pawan Negi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Parthiv PatelLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
