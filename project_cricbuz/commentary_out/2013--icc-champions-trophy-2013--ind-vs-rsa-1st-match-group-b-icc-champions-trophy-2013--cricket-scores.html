Amla is on strike. Bhuvneshwar will open the attackBhuvneshwar Kumar will open for India. He has 2 slips in placeWelcome back.. South Africa have a mountain to climb. The highest chase on this ground was by Australia who made 258/3 against Pakistan, way back in 2001. South Africa have the batsmen for the job, and bowling is usually considered as India's weakness.Another stat via Mohandas Menon: The highest ODI total made by any team batting 2nd in England (& also win) is 326/8 by India v Eng (325-5) at Lord's 2002Stat: India end with 331. This is the highest score at Cardiff in an ODI. Previous highest: 304, also by India vs England in 2011Jadeja's innings might well make the difference between a par score and a winning score. India were in a spot of bother when they lost 4 quick wickets after Dhawan's brilliant maiden ODI hundred. Dhoni and Jadeja consolidated and the former was dismissed just when he was looking to cut loose. Jadeja ensured that the runs kept coming and took India past 330. South Africa's bowling and fielding was below par and the pick of their bowlers was JP Duminy who managed to keep things tight in the middle overs. de Villiers probably made a mistake by giving just 3.1 overs to his main spinner Robin Peterson. This total will take some chasing, but South Africa do have the batsmen. Join us in 30 minutes for the chase.4

They will be relieved that they don't have to face Dale Steyn though!The players are walking out to the ground. Time for the national anthems.Teams: South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Colin Ingram, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(w/c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Robin Peterson, Morne Morkel, Rory Kleinveldt, Lonwabo TsotsobeIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Dinesh Karthik, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Ishant SharmaDhoni: "It's cold but it's comfortable. Birmingham was even colder so this is much better. The conditions are very different in England so it was good to come early and play some warm up games. We would have bowled first as well, but if the conditions remain the same, it shouldn't be a problem. Vijay misses out, Rohit Sharma will open."ABD: "We're missing some experience but the youngsters bring a lot of energy into the side. It's overcast and there will be some movement. Important to hit the deck hard and stick to the game plan. We have 4 seamers and Robin Peterson is there as well. Ingram is opening today. Steyn should be fit soon. We don't want to risk him early in the tournament. "South Africa have won the toss and elected to fieldDale Steyn is not playingTeam news: It is still not clear if Dale Steyn will play today's game. He has a side strain and could sit out. For India, the biggest problem is the form of their openers - Vijay and Dhawan. Will India stick with that combination? Or will they ask Rohit Sharma, who is in no better form, to open? Toss and other updates coming up shortly.The warm-ups are over and it's time for some real action. World Champions and number 1 ODI side in the world - India - will take on one of the favourites of the tournament - South Africa - in the Champions Trophy opener. It's cold at Cardiff for now and it's expected to remain that way. The conditions suggest that the batsmen could find the going difficult, at least for the initial part of the game.Teams:India (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Shikhar Dhawan, Dinesh Karthik, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Irfan Pathan, Ishant Sharma, Murali Vijay, Umesh Yadav, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli, Amit Mishra, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Vinay KumarSouth Africa (From): AB de Villiers(w/c), Farhaan Behardien, Faf du Plessis, Rory Kleinveldt, David Miller, Robin Peterson, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Hashim Amla, Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, Ryan McLaren, Morne Morkel, Aaron Phangiso, Dale Steyn, Alviro PetersenLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
