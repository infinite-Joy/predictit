Tharanga is on strike. Umar Gul will open the attackYounis Khan: If you play for five-six years, it is all about changing the mood to suit that format. The new rules are very nice and it will be fun. The conditions are dry and there will be some moisture in the night. Whenever Afridi plays for us, it boosts our morale. The Sri Lankans are a good unit in ODIs and they have some good young players. We have some good youngsters like Asad Shafiq and Junaid Khan.Pitch Report: There has been no ODI cricket played in Dubai for the past one year. The pitch is dry and there is an even covering of grass. There will be good bounce on this track, reckons Russell Arnold. The spinners will have to use their variations.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Kosala Kulasekara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Suranga LakmalPakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Farhat, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Abdul Razzaq, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Umar Gul, Aizaz Cheema, Saeed AjmalMisbah: Everybody would want to bat first on this wicket. The return of Shahid Afridi and Abdul Razzaq will boost us. The bowlers are taking wickets and that is a welcome sign.Dilshan: It is a good wicket to bat on. The sun is out and we will be looking to put some runs on the board. We are playing some good ODI cricket. Kumar Sangakkara will keep.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batPakistan will welcome the return of Shahid Afridi, who is making a comeback into international cricket.Hello and Welcome to the first ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka from Dubai. Pakistan emerged victorious in the Test series and they will be looking to carry their confidence into the ODI series. After the disappointment in the Tests, Sri Lanka would be looking up to Malinga to boost their confidence as they look to be a competitive unit in the ODIs. Join us in a short while for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Gokul GopalFollowing the 1-0 series victory in the 3-match Test series, Pakistan head into the ODIs as a confident outfit. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, need to come up with an improved performance to challenge the Pakistan side.Head to Head: Pakistan have played a total of 35 matches against Sri Lanka at the United Arab Emirates. Pakistan won 21 of those matches while the Lankan side ended up victorious on 13 occasions. There was one game which ended as a tie.Pakistan: The conditions at the UAE may not be best suited for the bowlers but Pakistan played with a lot of spirit and used the conditions to their advantage as much as possible to win the Test series. The eventual outcome might have been an 1-0 result in favour of Pakistan, but it required a lot of hard work on part of the Sri Lankans to manage to draw the first and the third Tests. Heading into the five-match ODI series, the focus will mainly be on Shahid Afridi after the controversial all-rounder decided to come out of his temporary retirement and was selected for the limited overs series. Apart from Afridi, Abdul Razzaq and Umar Akmal were also recalled for the ODI games and they too would be closely observed. Pakistan have the right mix in the batting line-up. Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan are the main pillars while talented players like Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Farhat and Umar Akmal along with the all-rounders provide the balance.Bowling has always been a strong point of the Pakistan team over the years and it still remains that way. In Umar Gul and Junaid Khan, Pakistan have a good pace attack while Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi are quality spinners. They also have Abdul Razzaq and Mohammad Hafeez who can contribute with the ball making the attack a formidable one.Sri Lanka: Kumar Sangakkara scored 516 runs in the three Tests at an average of 86 and this included a double hundred and a century along with two fifties. But that apart, Sri Lanka had nothing great to speak about. Experienced batters like Mahela Jayawardene and Tillkakaratne Dilshan failed to find form in the series and to compound the woes the middle order was as brittle as it can get, resulting in a lack-lustre Test series for the Lankans.Now that the focus has shifted to the ODIs, the World Cup finalists will be hoping for a change in fortunes. In Upul Tharanga and youngster Dimuth Karunaratne, Sri Lanka have a couple of batsmen to add a new lease of life to the batting order. Sangakkara's current form is definitely a plus for the team from the Island Nation but they will be hoping that the likes of Mahela, Dilshan and Angelo Mathews to also get amongst the runs going up against the powerful bowling line-up of Pakistan.In the bowling department, Sri Lanka suffered a setback when Dhammika Prasad was ruled out due to a damage to his quadricep muscle on the first day of the third Test. But with the presence of Lasith Malinga for the limited overs games, Sri Lanka can boast of some strength in the pace department. The other quicks in the squad include Suranga Lakmal, Dilhara Fernando and Thissara Perera and the ones selected in the eleven will be expected to give adequate support to Malinga. When it comes to spin, Suraj Randiv will have an important role to play along with Jeevan Mendis or Seekkuge Prasanna who ever makes it to the team.Quotes:Both Afridi and Razzaq give strength to our team. We know Sri Lanka are a good side but we are ready for them: MisbahLasith (Malinga) is one of the assets for Sri Lanka. He is one of the great bowlers in the world and he can guide other bowlers as well: DilshanTeams:Pakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdur Rehman, Aizaz Cheema, Asad Shafiq, Imran Farhat, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Malik, Umar Gul, Younis Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shahid Afridi, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Sohail Tanvir, Umar AkmalSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Suraj Randiv, Kosala Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Dilhara Fernando, Dimuth Karunaratne, Lasith Malinga, Jeevan Mendis, Thissara Perera, Upul Tharanga, Seekkuge PrasannaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
