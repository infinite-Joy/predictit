Our part time spinners have done well here and I also want to contribute and do well today. I am elated to be part of the WC squad, its a dream come true for me. I have never played a single game in India and I am looking forward to experiencing the thrill there.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Morne van Wyk, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Johan Botha, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo TsotsobeIndia (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Parthiv Patel, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Piyush ChawlaDhoni: We are going to bowl first. The ball does a bit initially and we would like to make the most of it. Irrespective of what happens today, we are going back home. No added pressure. It has been a closely fought series, that's what international cricket is all about.Smith: We would have bowled too, it is a good ground to chase. The crowds have been fantastic, we have a full house again today, hopefully the game lives upto all the hype. We are going in with the same side.India have won the toss and elected to fieldSquads: India bring in Piyush Chawla for Ashish Nehra. South Africa are going in with an unchanged side.Pitch report: There was some rain in the morning, but the sun is beating hard now. There has been 40 ODIs here, 25 day games, 17 have been won by the side batting second. Coming back to the pitch, it does not look that great. But, often the pitch plays better than it looks. The wicket is patchy, once the batsmen see through the initial overs, it will be a fantastic day to bat on feels Shaun Pollock.The sun has come out now, good signs.Gary Kirsten: I am very happy with the way things have gone so far. A couple of Indian players have proved their mettle. The players have learnt quickly, playing in the South African conditions mainly depend on your mental state, you need to anticipate. The guys have played good cricket from quite some time. The youngsters have come out and they are fighting for their spot in the World Cup XI. The guys will get some time out to freshen up before the WC, they have been under a lot of mental stress since September. It is important that the guys don't pick up injuries at this stage.Weather update: The conditions are slightly overcast, not as bad as it was predicted to be. There are a few scattered clouds, fingers crossed, we may get a result.'None of the teams hold advantage, we have to go out and play well on Sunday. It would be a slightly better batting wicket than what we have seen so far in this series,' Smith at the press conference."The more the number of in-form batsmen, the better it is. I think it's a big positive for us, and we hope that he (Virat) keeps scoring," Dhoni at the press conference.A warm welcome to the series decider, you can also call it 'the tour decider'. A nerve-wracking Test series, a fantastic T20 and a closely fought ODI series, we have seen it all. This would be the last ODI that the two teams would be playing before the World Cup. None of them would want to end up on the losing side, and if the weather holds good, we are in for a crackerjack of a contest. This is Ajith, I will take you through along with Karthik and Pradeep. Don't go away, we'll be back with more news.Preview:Just like the Test series was decided on the final day of final Test, so too, the ODI series looks set to go down to the wire, with the score-line reading a tantalizing 2-2 for India and South Africa.
South Africa have outplayed India in both their victories, while both India's wins have been in close matches that saw them emerge triumphant as much due to greater mental fortitude as cricketing skills.
To register a maiden ODI series triumph in South Africa though, India will have to pull up their collective batting socks, since batting has been the main worry for the visitors, with the bowlers acquitting themselves well on the whole.
Virat Kohli has been the only bright spot in the series for India in an otherwise out-of-form batting line-up, which has been hit hard by injuries to key players like Sachin Tendulkar and opening duo of Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir.
The rest of the batting has come a cropper in the series so far with skipper Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina all failing to consolidate on the starts they have got.
What will be worrying Dhoni the most is the opening slot. Rohit Sharma's woeful run continues at the top while Parthiv Patel, who replaced an out-of-touch Murali Vijay in the last match, failed to make any impact.
Dhoni himself conceded that the middle-order need to fire after the visitors failed to secure a historic series-win in the fourth ODI.
"It's (Kohli's batting) a big positive for us. It's good for us at number three. He has carried through the innings but the other batsmen also need to chip in. The middle-order has not clicked," Dhoni said.
"It (final match) will be interesting. The team that handles pressure better will win," he added.
India's bowling was a tad wayward in the fourth ODI, but for a large part of the South African innings it was the Indians that had the upperhand, but allowed it to slip. However, given that the bowlers have generally been consistent, and were good for more than half of the 4th ODI too, Dhoni and coach Kirsten are likely to work more towards addressing the batting issues.
With World Cup around the corner, India will not only want to win the series in South Africa but also see the youngsters, who have done well in the recent past, show some character on the pacy South Africa pitches before the game's show-piece event, which starts next month.
Winning the series is not going to be easy for the visitors though, with South Africa showing that they have the stomach for a fight with their handsome win in the fourth match. Given that they had lost the previous two matches by close margins, it was a commendable effort by South Africa to pick themselves up, shake themselves off and put in the kind of performance they did. That win will also mean South Africa go into the final match high on confidence.
The Proteas may be missing the required balance in the side in the absence of veteran all-rounder Jacques Kallis, but someone or the other has chipped in with runs for the home team when they needed most.
Among the batsmen, the most reliable has been JP Duminy, who has stolen a march over the more illustrious names in the line-up, leaving behind the likes of Amla, Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers.
The left-handed Duminy scored fifties in consecutive matches to rescue the South African innings in both the third and fourth ODIs.
Duminy's crucial unbeaten 71 in the fourth ODI turned out to be a match-winning effort, and also saw him share two vital partnerships - both above 50 runs - that bailed South Africa to safety after wickets had fallen in a hurry.
The South African bowling, meanwhile, has been the talking point of the series with Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tostsobe igniting fire upfront while Botha has been stemming the run flow in the middle overs.
The Test series was drawn and India won the lone T20 International. In that sense, this match is the decider not just for the ODI series, but for the tour as a whole. If South Africa win, they will hold the bragging rights, since a win in a 5-match ODI series would carry greater weight than a win in the lone T20. If India win, they would have gone back from South Africa having drawn the Tests and won the limited-overs contests. In short, both teams have everything to play for.
