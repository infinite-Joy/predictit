Banged in halfway by Riaz, it was angling away outside off, Masakadza is hurried in his pull and only manages a thick top-edge. The ball swirls in the air on it's way to fine leg and holds up in the atmosphere. No problem for Irfan. H Masakadza c Irfan b Riaz 7(22) [4s-1]Riaz to H Masakadza, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ZIMBABWE:4.5 Irfan to H Masakadza, FOUR, I just realized that he wasn't off the mark even before this delivery. 14 balls of patience is followed by a waft down the ground.

All set to go..Right, so I was talking about the pitch in the buildup and seems like we have some green on it today. I am all agog to see Zimbabwe's approach. They haven't looked up there with their body language so far in this series. Hopefully today will be different.Chigumbura: "Definitely we would have bowled first. But we have to adjust and look to put up a good score. Looking at the last game, we lost 9 wickets to spin (actually, they had lost all 10 to spin). Something to work on there. No changes in our team."Azhar: "We're going to bowl first. Early on it does a little bit with the new ball and doesn't quite come on. So, we will try and capitalize. Wicket looks green, but not that much. We'll have to wait and watch how it plays. We have two changes."Pitch report: "Fresh wicket today. There's a bit of grass on it, a green tinge which hasn't been there on Zimbabwe wickets for 3 months. It will allow the ball to come on better and level the game up. Should be a good cricket wicket," reckons Ed RainsfordTeams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Bilal Asif, Mohammad Hafeez, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Asad Shafiq, Aamer Yamin, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Mohammad IrfanZimbabwe (Playing XI): Brian Chari, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Elton Chigumbura(c), Richmond Mutumbami(w), Luke Jongwe, Graeme Cremer, Tinashe Panyangara, John NyumbuPakistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldToss in around 10 minutes..Zimbabwe opening batsman Brian Chari, speaking ahead of the match, plotted out a course of action for his teammates to tackle spin better - use your feet. Hope they don't forget to use the bat better as well. The 22-yards will be interesting for this one. Previous match was a nightmare for the hosts who were perhaps a bit too hospitable for their own good - dishing out a vicious turner enabling Yasir Shah and company to run riot. Not again, certainly.It's all too easy to be lulled into believing that Pakistan have been the big bully right through the tour - that's not the case. The batting has been rusty and if not for their lower middle order pulling off some rescue acts, results might have been different. It has really been the bowlers - as it so often is with Pakistan - who have bailed them out of trouble. Coupled with some inept, spin-phobic opposition batsmen of course.Will the real Zimbabwe turn up please? About time they do in today's 2nd ODI, or else bid goodbye to the ODI series as well after the T20 whitewash. Surely the home team is much better than what they have produced so far. Surely the batting order has more to it than what we have seen in the two T20Is and the first ODI. Surely they are more than just a bunch of whipping boys. Surely. Welcome fellas to our live coverage of this match.Preview:After a demoralising loss (by 131 runs) in the first ODI on Thursday, Elton Chigumbura's Zimbabwe face an uphill task to find a favourable result on Saturday and stay alive in the three-match ODI series. Azhar Ali's Pakistan, on the other hand, are well-placed to seal another series victory. Venue: Harare Sports Club, HarareTime: 13.00 hrs ISTWeather: Partly cloudy with a 10% chance of rain.ZimbabweWhile the hosts can take heart from their performances with the ball, their efforts with the bat remain a constant work-in-progress. In a challenging yet not a daunting chase, Zimbabwean top-order put on an over-cautious cloak. When they attempted to shift gears, the wickets began to tumble. The batsmen were found wanting against the grip and turn of Yasir Shah and need to up their game, if they are to cause an upset on Saturday. Zimbabwe's best chance of pushing Pakistan to the wall would be to bat first and put up a big total and rely on their bowlers to crank up the pressure against Pakistan's vulnerable batting line-up.Chigumbura will also hope for his bowlers to show better resilience on the field and maintain the pressure on the opposition batsmen all through the innings. On Thursday, they started well but once the middle-order batsmen came out to bat, they ended up taking their foot off the pedal and were eventually toppled. The hosts need to be mindful that a good start would mean absolutely nothing if they fail to keep it going right till the end.Probable XI: Brian Chari, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Elton Chigumbura(c), Richmond Mutumbami(w), Luke Jongwe, John Nyumbu, Graeme Cremer, Tinashe PanyangaraPakistanAfter a clinical performance in the first ODI, Pakistan's only cause of concern ahead of the second should be their top-order. None among Azhar Ali, Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez managed to get their eye in to make a big score. The middle-order had to come to the team's rescue after Zimbabwe bowlers started well.On the sluggish wicket in Harare, Yasir Shah will hold the aces once again. His six-wicket heroics on Thursday threw Zimbabwe off-guard and kept them out of the chase from the very beginning. Shoaib Malik too ran ragged to finish with three wickets and his performance with the ball will also be crucial for the visitors.
