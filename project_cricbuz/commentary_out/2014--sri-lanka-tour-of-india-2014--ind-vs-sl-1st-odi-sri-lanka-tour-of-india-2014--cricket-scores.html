The umpires are sorting it out. The players seem to be getting a bit frustrated now. Ok, all set. Here we go with the first ball....India have posted the highest team total in all ODIs at this ground. Openers Shikhar Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane got the side off to a great start with a double-century stand. Both registered hundreds before perishing in quick succession. Suresh Raina, who was promoted up the order, then batted aggressively and scored a quick-fire fifty in his 200th ODI. He also crossed 5000 runs in the process. Although India lost a few wickets at the end, they were able to score at a brisk pace. Not a great story with the ball for Sri Lanka. They bowled well in patches, but overall, looked out of sorts. Their fielding wasn't all that great as well. The run chase is going to be interesting folks. Can the experienced batting line-up deny India? Join us back in a short while for the Sri Lankan essay.4

So the warning he's got now in this over, is the first.

Two slips in place.The entire Sri Lankan team and umpires are observing a one-minute silence for the loss of lives because of floods, landslides and heavy rains that troubled Sri Lanka recently.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Suraj Randiv, Dhammika Prasad, Lahiru GamageIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli(c), Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Akshar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Varun Aaron, Ishant SharmaVirat Kohli: "I would have bowled first as well. Bit of dew factor later. Looks like a hard and fresh wicket, just like Dharamsala. It is a wonderful opportunity for me. MS Dhoni has been a wonderful captain. I just want to take these boys along and give them an opportunity. With the World Cup just around the corner, this will be a good challenge. We have rested Jadeja, Mishra is not playing. Two more people are not there. Vijay and don't quite remember the other name."Angelo Mathews: "I will have a bowl first. The dew is going to be a major factor in the evening. Otherwise I would have batted. I know, past experiences here have not been good for us. Hopefully, we will set that right. There are a lot of guys to be looked at in the bowling department."Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: "There are plenty of cracks but they are quite solid and not moving. If they start to break off, it will create a lot of problem. However, it looks like the cracks won't come into the picture. The pitch is very hard and lot of runs are going to be scored", reckon Sunil Gavaskar and Michael Holding."India is always a tough challenge. It gives us an opportunity to try out different things. Although it is a tough tour for us, we need to look at it in a positive way. We have had a great year. Winning is a good habit. Hopefully, we keep it going. We have not won a series here. That is a motivation" says Mahela JayawardeneGreetings and welcome to the start of the unexpected 5-match ODI series between familiar foes - India and Sri Lanka. This may be a hastily-arranged series, yet it promises to be a competitive one. Don't stray too much, ladies and gentlemen, for toss, teams and all the action heading your way in a short while.Kohli has a tremendous record against Sri Lanka - 1,527 runs in 35 ODIs at an average of 52.65 runs with five centuries and eight fifties.Sri Lanka have never won a bilateral ODI series in India.STAT ALERT: This Cuttack ODI will be Raina's 200th. He needs only 44 more to get to 5000 ODI runs.MS Dhoni has also been rested to stay fresh for the Australian tour. Virat Kohli will take over the captaincy reins, while Saha will slot in as keeper-batsman after recuperating from a finger injury. A couple of good performances from Saha can shore up his position as the Number 2 keeper-batsman. Despite the absence of Dhoni, the batting looks in good shape with Kohli rediscovering form and Raina extending his purple patch.Meanwhile, India have problems of their own, none more worrying than the third pacer. While Shami and Bhuvneshwar pick themselves in the Playing XI for the World Cup, Umesh, Aaron, Ishant and Kulkarni will fight it out in a four-way tussle. With India's go-to death bowler, Shami ruled out of the Sri Lanka ODIs owing to injury and Bhuvneshwar getting a break, the bowling attack lacks incision, Ashwin's return notwithstanding. Rohit and Karn, who dazzled in the practice match, are likely to be picked in the squad for the last two ODIs. However, Karn has to lift his game further to push ahead of Mishra and Axar.The lack of preparation told when Sri Lanka were hammered by India A in the warm-up one-dayer. Dhammika captured 3 wickets but leaked runs, much like his compatriots. Rohit Sharma and Manish Pandey donned their attacking avatars and took the Sri Lankans to the cleaners. Though the Sri Lankan batters got a look in, it was never going to be enough in a steep chase of 383.To say Sanga and Mahela are the pillars of batting is to say Albert Einstein was a scientist - it tells a criminally bare story. However, with Thirimanne, Chandimal and Senanayake missing the cut, the likes of Dickwella, Priyanjan and Seekkuge will be keen to impress and state their cases for a World Cup berth. The visitors will also be without Malinga (recovering from ankle surgery) and Herath(rested). The pace bowling options come from Kulasekara, Dhammika, Gamage, Thisara and captain Mathews himself.In the aftermath of West Indies pulling out of the India tour mid-way due to an acute payment dispute, Sri Lanka were roped in to fill the void. While Sri Lanka skipper, Angelo Mathews has bluntly admitted that his boys are under-prepared, citing dearth of appropriate training, this Indian sojourn gives an opportunity to test out the fringe players and plug the loopholes ahead of sterner examinations. Dilshan is a cinch at the top of the order, but the other half of the opening combination has been a case of musical chairs with Tharanga, Kusal Perera and even Mahela being whisked in and out.Preview by MS RamakrishnanSri Lanka are on Indian soil currently, to play a five-match ODI series, starting on November 2, Sunday. This is a make-shift series arranged by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), after the sudden pull out of the West Indies team midway from their India tour. The Indian board then requested the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to send its team for a short series, to which the SLC agreed immediately. Now, both teams are in Cuttack, to play the first ODI at the Barabati Stadium.The last time Sri Lanka toured India for a bilateral series was in 2009 and the last time Sri Lanka played India in India was in the 2011 World Cup final, which India won comfortably.IndiaThe hosts will miss the services of their regular captain, MS Dhoni, who has been rested for the three ODIs. Meanwhile, it is a great opportunity for Virat Kohli to show his captaincy skills. India have been in fine form in the ODI format of late, with three consecutive series wins against Bangladesh, England and West Indies respectively. Although Rohit Sharma hit a sparkling hundred against India 'A', he couldn't prove his fitness, after recovering from injury, when the selectors picked the squad for the first three ODIs.Kohli's return to form has come at the right time for him and remember, Kohli averages over 50 against Sri Lanka with 5 hundreds and 8 fifties to his name. Suresh Raina, who will be playing his 200th ODI, has been batting exceptionally well and is looking in great touch. However, India's concern with the batting line-up is right at the top. Opener, Shikhar Dhawan, is hot and cold and it is high time that he lifts his game, before the World Cup 2015.Meanwhile, with Dhoni clearly expressing concerns about India's fast bowling options for the 2015 World Cup during the West Indies series, it is a body blow that Shami Ahmed, the highest wicket-taker in ODIs in 2014, has been ruled of the entire series due to an injury. Dhawal Kulkarni takes his place, while Varun Aaron too gets a chance as original spearhead, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, has been rested.Sri LankaThe Sri Lankan cricket team was in the middle of a six-week fitness program, ahead of their home series against England, when the sudden announcement of this short series was made. This meant that they had to leave their programme midway and prepare for the India tour. Senior pro, Kumar Sangakkara, had openly admitted that this was a hastily arranged series. Captain Angelo Mathews then made it clear that his side was willing to come to India, but stressed that they would have liked to have enough time to prepare to play a side like India.The Islanders are without the injured Lasith Malinga, their key man with the ball. To make matters worse, they lost their warm-up match badly to India 'A' a few days ago, despite fielding a full strength squad. In the batting department, the onus is again on experienced campaigners, Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara. Mathews has been in good form this year, while Upul Tharanga made some valuable runs in the warm-up game. Quite contrastingly, the bowling attack, spearheaded by Nuwan Kulasekara, looks quite inexperienced. Apart from Thisara Perera, and Mathews, no one has played more than 30 ODIs.Pitch and conditions:The square at the Barabati Stadium has not quite yielded big scores. The run-scoring has been quite tough due to its slow nature. Although the last ODI scheduled here, India v Australia, October 26, 2013, was washed off due to rain, the weather for tomorrow is quite clear.Quotes:"The results of such matches don't matter a lot to visiting sides as much as they matter to the home teams. They are a quality side. They have crowned themselves as world champions in one format (T20) of the game," coach Sanjay Bangar after Sri Lanka's loss in the warm-up match."If some of the other players in our batting line-up except the two senior players (Jayawardene, Sangakkara) and the captain (Mathews) can take up the burden, we will do better," Sri Lanka coach Marvan Atapattu.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Chaturanga de Silva, Thisara Perera, Ashan Priyanjan, Nuwan Kulasekara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Lahiru Gamage, Suraj Randiv, Kushal Janith Perera, Dhammika Prasad, Niroshan DickwellaIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli(c), Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Varun Aaron, Dhawal Kulkarni, Amit Mishra, Akshar Patel, Murali VijayLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
