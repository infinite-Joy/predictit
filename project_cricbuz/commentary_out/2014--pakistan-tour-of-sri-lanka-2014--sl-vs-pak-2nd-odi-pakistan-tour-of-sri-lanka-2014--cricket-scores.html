SRI LANKA:1.6 Junaid Khan to Dilshan, out Caught by U Akmal!! A surprising decision considering the evidence was inconclusive. The ball was angling away from the batsman as he flayed at it. There was only a slight sound as the ball passed the bat. The third umpire reckoned, Dilshan probably got a thin nick and the ball went through to the keeper. Dilshan looks disappointed but there is nothing he can do about it. Dilshan c U Akmal b Junaid Khan 13(10) [4s-3]Junaid Khan to Dilshan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Huge appeal for caught behind.

Irfan will open the attackGood crowd in today in Hambantota. The openers are getting ready. Mohammad Irfan will open the attack for Pakistan. 2 slips in place. Here we go with the first ball...Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith MalingaPakistan (Playing XI): Sharjeel Khan, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Umar Akmal(w), Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Fawad Alam, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Junaid Khan, Mohammad IrfanMisbah-ul-Haq: "It looks a bit dry so batting would have been a good choice. I think we can improve in the death overs. And also we need to perform well in the top order. Sharjeel comes in place of Younis. It happens sometimes but we cannot do anything about it (when asked about the tragedy in Younis' family). Two of our youngsters had a very good partnership that day and the confidence of team is pretty high after that. Spinners will play an important role on this pitch. But also, fast bowlers can do well because reverse swing will be an important aspect."Angelo Mathews: "I will bat first. It looks a pretty hard wicket and we want to put some runs on the board. We batted and bowled pretty well but it comes down to individual brilliance. They did well there. One change, Chandimal is out and Seekkuge Prasanna is in."Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "The wicket is similar to the one in the first ODI. There has been no rain since then and it is a dry pitch. The cracks will open up later. The captain winning the toss will definitely bat first. Later on under the lights, it will be slightly cooler. But there will not be much dew. The wear and tear will remain on the pitch. A score of around 275 will be par on this track," reckons Russel Arnold.The weather is bright and sunny. It is expected to remain so all throughout the match.The sad news for Pakistan is that Younis Khan has gone back home due to the unfortunate demise of his nephew. Sharjeel Khan is likely to get a game in place of him.While the hosts comprehensively clinched the Test series, it seems like both teams are evenly matched in this format. Due to incessant rains in Colombo, the venue of this second game was shifted hastily. Although Sri Lanka have a perfect opportunity to square the series under sunny skies, the fact that they have lost their last 3 ODIs here might be haunting them.After an intriguing first ODI at Hambantota, Pakistan came on the top with a close fought last over finish against the hosts. The fantastic 89 not out by Sohaib Maqsood and his record sixth wicket stand with Fawad Alam (62) paved way for a well-deserved victory. Sri Lanka, meanwhile, will be rueing the fact that they came so close to victory and could not achieve it. Although their batting was solid, they were let down by their mediocre bowling.Preview by Bharath RamarajAfter winning a nail-biting encounter in the first ODI against Sri Lanka at Hambantotta with one ball to spare, Pakistan will look to wrap up the series by winning the second game. It is intriguing to note that the second game was initially scheduled to be held at Colombo (RPS), but because of incessant rain in Colombo, the match now will take place at Hambantota. The match also was forwarded to 26 August.Sri LankaThe hosts, Sri Lanka, would be bitterly disappointed by the fact that they lost a humdinger of a match to Pakistan in the first ODI. Despite crunching performances from seasoned campaigners; Mahela Jayawardene and Angelo Mathews, Sri Lanka lost the match. It was their bowling that was below par. Lasith Malinga, known for his ability to bowl toe-crushing yorkers and bouncers with unremitting accuracy couldn't find his rhythm, and that didn't help Sri Lanka's cause. The usually reliable, Nuwan Kulasekara, who has in the past shown the ability to bowl well at home also struggled to make his mark. The threat from slow left-arm orthodox, Rangana Herath, was negated by Pakistan's batsmen especially, Sohaib Maqsood. Despite Thisara Perera making a valuable contribution with the bat in hand, Sri Lanka may look to bring in Dhammika Prasad for the next game. Suraj Randiv is another option. In short, Sri Lanka seem to lack another specialist bowler.PakistanThe Pakistan think-tank would be buoyed by how well the unit came back after losing the Test series 2-0. When a team goes through the wallow of mediocrity by losing matches, any victory can lift the sagging morale of the set-up.In the first game, Ahmed Shehzad and Maqsood looked in fine touch and Pakistan need them to continue their good form. One of the strengths of this Pakistan line-up is that in Fawad Alam, Maqsood and Shahid Afridi, they have enough firepower to make a rip-roaring comeback and win games in the end overs. The old hands, Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan are still around as well. Khan though, will miss the final two ODIs of the series due to the death of his nephew. With Saeed Ajmal unavailable due to him being reported for suspect bowling action, Pakistan's bowling will depend on their pacers, Junaid Khan, Wahab Riaz and Mohammad Irfan. Even though, Junaid had a poor game in the last match, he is the spearhead of the attack. Junaid can bowl with a tunnel-vision aim to succeed in the end overs, and bowls yorkers at will. Riaz has a tendency to go for runs, but is a genuine wicket-taker in any format of the game. Irfran, the giant of a man can generate disconcerting bounce and hits the bat hard. Interestingly, all three of them are left-arm pacers and that means Sri Lankan batsmen have to counter the left-armer's angle as wellGround conditionsThe track at Hambantota usually offers pace bowlers decent pace and bounce and that is good news for batsmen too. The toss shouldn't play a major role at the ground.Trivia Dinesh Chandimal needs 52 more runs to aggregate 2,000 ODI runs.Angelo Mathews needs 80 more runs to reach the milestone of 3,000 ODI runs.Teams:Pakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sharjeel Khan, Umar Akmal(w), Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Fawad Alam, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Talha, Zulfiqar Babar, Anwar AliSri Lanka (From): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Ashan Priyanjan, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Suraj Randiv, Dhammika Prasad, Seekkuge PrasannaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
