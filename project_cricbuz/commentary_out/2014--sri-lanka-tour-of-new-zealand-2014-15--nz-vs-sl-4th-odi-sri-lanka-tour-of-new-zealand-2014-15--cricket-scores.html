N Kulasekara will open the attackWelcome back.. Kulasekara will start the proceedings for Sri Lanka with a slip in placeJayawardene then stabilized the innings with Thirimanne, putting on 65 runs for the 5th wicket before Thirimanne departed. Jaywardene also perished soon after while trying to accelerate the scoring, falling short of a ton by 6 runs. At the end, Sri Lanka folded for 276 and the Black Caps need 277 runs to take a 2-1 lead in the series. The run-chase starts in a short while from now. Stay tuned.Earlier, Sri Lanka got off to a poor start, losing opener Karunaratne when the team score was just 11. Dilshan and Sangakkara then steadied the innings with a 102-run stand, increasing the run-rate in the process as well. After Dilshan got out, Sanga was joined by Jayawardene at the crease, who was in sublime touch. Sanga, in the meanwhile, became the third highest run-scorer in ODIs, going past Sanath Jayasuriya. Both batsmen batted well, but Sangakkara got out in the 34th over. Mathews then came to the crease and was out the next ball as well.New Zealand must be delighted with how they pulled things back in the last few overs. At one stage, when Sangakkara and Jayawardene were batting, Sri Lanka looked all set to achieve a total in excess of 300, but the Black Caps bowlers bowled really well towards the end. Southee was the pick of the bowlers, taking 3 wickets and he was well supported by Milne and McClenaghan, who picked up 2 wickets each.4

Bowling against batsmen like Brendon McCullum is no easy task, but they need to focus more on the right line and lengths. Herath, Senanayake and Dilshan have bowled well, but need the same kind of support from their pacers. It should be a cracker of a contest. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.For Sri Lanka, Dilshan's century in the second ODI showed that they are up for a fight. His ton helped Sri Lanka win their first game on the tour. With the likes of Sangakkara, Jayawardene and Mathews in the team, Sri Lankan batting looks very solid. However, they will be up against the likes of Southee, Milne and McClenaghan. The Kiwi bowlers have bowled good line and lengths, making life difficult for the visitors.The Black Caps will be a little worried about Ross Taylor's current form as he hasn't looked confident with the bat. Grant Elliott is all set to make a return to the team, with Latham expected to sit this game out, in accordance with New Zealand's rotation policy. The Kiwis will also take a late call on whether Kane Williamson is fit to play this ODI or not.After the third ODI got washed out, the 7-match series has now effectively become a 6-game series. With both teams tied at 1-1, today's game is going to be very important for both the teams. Hello and welcome to the fourth ODI between New Zealand and Sri Lanka.PreviewOverview:The seven-match series moves to the north-west of New Zealand, to the city of Nelson, with the teams level at 1-1. The recent performances of Brendon McCullum's men have slowly improved their World Cup stocks from 'dark horses' to 'possible semi-finalists'. A win in Nelson tomorrow will not only reinforce their current standing in World cricket but also give them a crucial lead in the tune-up series. That holds true for Sri Lanka, too. After an indifferent performance in the first ODI, they put up a far better show in Hamilton. A win in Nelson, will mark a good turnaround of fortunes after the drubbing in the Test series.New Zealand:Brendon McCullum has stood head and shoulders above his mates in terms of performances. His blitz in the first ODI was followed by an equally entertaining century in the second. Much of the team's fortunes hinges on how McCullum goes at the top of the order. That isn't to say that New Zealand is a one-man team. In fact, their pace bowling combination of Trent Boult, Adam Milne and Mitchell McClenaghan have been thoroughly impressive. The middle-order's competence against quality spin remains an area of concern. Ross Taylor, after being rested for the opening encounter, has struggled to get going. Ditto for Tom Latham despite a dogged 42 in the abandoned third ODI. Grant Elliott will take his place in the middle-order and New Zealand will take a late call on Kane Williamson's fitness.Sri Lanka:Sri Lanka fought back well after the defeat in Christchurch. Tillakaratne Dilshan's century in Hamilton gave them a much needed win on the tour. With Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews around, the batting still looks capable. They will however, be vary of Lahiru Thirimanne's no-show. While their pacers have gone for plenty in the face of McCullum's onslaughts, the return of Rangana Herath and his combination with Sachithra Senanayake holds Sri Lanka in good stead. Dilshan meanwhile has emerged as a capable bowling option for Mathews and could prompt the skipper to play an extra seamer.Pitch and Conditions:In a stark contrast to the weather in Auckland, Nelson is expected to be bright and sunny.Stats and Trivia:Kumar Sangakkara is 17-runs shy of overtaking Sanath Jayasuriya and becoming Sri Lanka's top run-getter in ODI history.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Dimuth Karunaratne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Sachithra Senanayake, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Dinesh Chandimal, Shaminda Eranga, Rangana Herath, Dhammika Prasad, Lasith MalingaNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Tom Latham, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Matt Henry, Daniel Vettori, Kane Williamson, Adam Milne, Kyle Mills, Trent BoultLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
