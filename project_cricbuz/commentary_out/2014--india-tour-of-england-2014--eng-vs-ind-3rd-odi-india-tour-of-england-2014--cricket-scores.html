J Anderson will open the attackHello again.. The England players are in a huddle. Cook will need to inspire his men, if they have to defend 227. How will Dhawan and Rahane go about the proceedings? Answer coming up shortly as Anderson marks his run-up.India in England,19961st Test, Edgbaston - England won by 8 wicketsJavagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad bowled with verve and purpose but the Indian batsmen caved in meekly. Srinath also scored a brisk 52 with the bat in India's first innings. Paras Mhambrey also hit 28, otherwise India would have never made past 214. Guided by Nasser Hussain's steady 128, England gained a crucial lead of 99. Sachin Tendulkar once again pulled the chestnuts out of fire, scoring a pristine 122 in India's second innings. Had he received some support from other end, India could have given some fight.Set a target of 121 runs, England eased home to go 1-0 up in the series.England started off well through Cook and Hales. The pair added 82 runs for the opening wicket. However, Cook's inability to score quickly affected Hales as he tried to up the ante and fell doing so. The middle order once again succumbed to the spinners. They lost 6 wickets for 67 runs. Buttler and Tredwell provided some impetus to the innings and took the score past the 220 mark. Can their bowlers defend this moderate total? Join us back in a few minutes to find out. Before we go here is part 39 of our detailing of the England-India series in England.India have managed to bowl their quota of overs well before the stipulated amount of time. Dhoni who chose to bowl, would not have expected his spinners to do the job on a seaming wicket. But, once he saw turn on offer, Dhoni was on the attack. He got 30 overs from Raina, Ashwin, Jadeja and Rayudu. They picked up 6 wickets between them and bogged down the batsmen in the middle overs. The bowlers were well complemented in the field, with the skipper leading from the front, he effected 4 dismissals.4

Looks like Root's back foot is on the line. A bit like Rahane's dismissal in the last game. Root has to go. OUT should be the call. Third ump taking a look at various angles.

ENGLAND:2.6 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, no run, defends to cover to end another testing over from Bhuvneshwar
ENGLAND:2.5 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, no run, almost a return chance! Cook too early into the flick and the leading edge pops tantalisingly out of the reach of the leaping Bhuvneshwar's outstretched right-hand. Cook must have had his heart in his mouth there
ENGLAND:2.4 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, 2 runs, the middle and leg stumps were visible as Cook stepped across and flicked it to long leg for a couple. That is a very risky ploy when the ball is swinging
ENGLAND:2.3 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, no run, good line and length from Bhuvneshwar, on the off stump corridor and on a fuller length, Cook is half-forward and defending to mid-off

ENGLAND:1.2 Mohit Sharma to Cook, no run, short of length outside off, punched to cover off the back foot
ENGLAND:1.1 Mohit Sharma to Cook, no run, short of length and seaming away, left aloneMohit Sharma, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
ENGLAND:0.6 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, 1 run, tucked off the pads to backward square leg, Cook used the swing to good effect to play it from middle and leg
ENGLAND:0.5 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, no run, swinging in, Cook gets forward and pushes it to mid-on

ENGLAND:0.3 Bhuvneshwar to Hales, no run, huge inswinger, but slides down leg and raps Hales on the pads, would've gone comfortably down leg
ENGLAND:0.2 Bhuvneshwar to Hales, no run, huge shout for caught behind, but there was no bat on that as Hales looked to pull, straight off the thigh pad and caught by Dhoni moving to his left, the Indians in the crowd went up, but the ump got it right
ENGLAND:0.1 Bhuvneshwar to Cook, 1 run, swing for Bhuvi, but the line is middle and leg, it slips past the inside edge of Cook who was looking to flick it, it would've gone down, so that's why there was no real appeal from the Indians. An extra to start off the match. Hang on - the umpire has given it as runs, assuming that there was bat on thatCook and Hales are at the crease. Cook is on strike. Bhuvneshwar will open the attackAll set for the start of the third game. The players are out there. Cook will be on strike. The rousing rendition of 'Jerusalem' comes to a close. Bhuvi has the new ball. Here we go. Two slips in place for him as he comes in.Teams:England (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Alex Hales, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, James Tredwell, Steven Finn, James AndersonIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Mohit SharmaCook: "It is an early morning start. Steven Finn comes back for Jordan. He has had some good results for Middlesex. A fully fit and firing Finn is a good addition to the team. Leaving Gurney out was a tough call."Dhoni: "We are looking to bowl first. It is an early morning start. Conditions won't change much. Rohit is out. Rayudu will bat in the middle order. Rahane will open the batting. We have exploited the conditions well. We have to bowl well in partnerships."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch report: "The wicket will have a little more pace. I think there will be a little bit of movement early on for the pacers. There won't be much turn for the spinners. It is definitely an improvement over the Test wicket. Not knowing what a good score is, may play a part in the toss. Considering the overcast conditions, one would want to bowl first" reckons Isa GuhaSteven Finn is seen marking his run-up. Will he pip Gurney to break into the English XI? Live pictures also show that conditions are overcast. The rain is expected to arrive at 5:00PM BSTIn the recent past, TB has dished out good batting tracks. In fact, the track for the first Test match played between England and India turned out to be a featherbed.Check out Gautam Bhimani's overnight tweet: Heavy rain in Nottingham this evening. Cleared now. More expected tomorrow. Not a washout but possible interrupted game. #EngvsIndWeather watch: Some showers have been forecast in the late evening at Nottingham. It rained overnight as well.Yes, the Jaddu-Jimmy sub-plot spices things up further.'The Indian management had pressed ahead in their bid to get the fast bowler banned for allegedly pushing Jadeja, so much so that they lost focus on the task at hand and lost the series 1-3 despite taking a 1-0 lead. As the two teams walk through that infamous narrow corridor of the pavilion at Trent Bridge, they will feel differently about that episode. India will feel that they have a point to prove. The format has changed, and as was apparent in Cardiff, they clearly hold the edge over England in limited-overs cricket' writes Suresh Ivaturi for the New Indian Express.'For the subsequent four days, the left-hander would end up facing thousands of serves directed at his ribs and head without a helmet. And the hours of enduring this unconventional practice routine would eventually culminate in Raina producing a 75-ball century at Cardiff on Wednesday.'He goes on, 'TUCKED away in a corner of Shivaji Park, the cricket mecca of Mumbai, are a bunch of inconspicuous tennis courts. In mid-August, it's here that Pravin Amre would discover the remedy for Suresh Raina's prolonged battle against the short-ball - the man with the fastest serve at the Gymkhana.'Devendra Pandey's piece for the Indian Express wears the headline: 'Pravin Amre serves Suresh Raina the short-ball remedy'"I'm 100 percent behind him as Test captain. But, in one-day cricket, you should pick your 11 best players and choose your captain from there and I don't think he is one of the best 11 players." wrote the former England off-spinner."Swann added, "I don't want him to be part of it. This is not a witch-hunt against 'Cookie' and I'm still a huge supporter of his captaincy in Test cricket. But, in one-day matches, I want England to play the exciting cricket they promised six months ago when Peter Moores took over as head coach. We're happy to tootle along in a two-litre diesel in a Formula One race.""Real mates are honest with each other. I'm no longer in the England dressing room and it is my job now as a pundit to give my honest thoughts. I think being one-day captain is a poisoned chalice for him. He just doesn't need the job. The cricket England are playing in 50-over cricket is outdated and I fear it will be a painful winter for the team."Graeme Swann, writing for the Sun, continues to fire barbs at the English ODI set-up.'Jordan, in particular, looked a shadow of the bowler who dismantled Sri Lanka at Old Trafford back in May. International cricket has gradually become a struggle for him since then and his confused run-up is leading to other difficulties. He has now bowled 61 wides in his 122 overs in one-day internationals, which works out at 8.33 wides per 100 balls, 2.5 more than anybody else who has played for England.''With England already distracted by the debate on the merits of Alastair Cook as one-day captain, the response was to pick three all-rounders, of varying strengths and different qualities: Jordan, Stokes and Chris Woakes, with Jos Buttler, the wicketkeeper again moving up to No 6. After India made 304 for 6, having been 19 for 2, it would seem to be a strategy in need of urgent revision.'Stephen Brenkley, writing for the Independent, also questions England's tactics.'At Cardiff the batsmen, albeit faced with an inflated target, also failed miserably. All are under scrutiny, although the microscope will be pointed in the direction of Cook more intensely than anyone else. This is inevitable even though Bell, Eoin Morgan, who has not been so prolific lately, and even Root, are not inspiring much confidence at the moment.'He says, 'England played horribly in Cardiff with bat and ball. Poor Jordan kept firing the ball down the leg-side for wides, while Stokes rarely gave the impression he knew where the ball was going to land. By contrast, Ian Bell and Root faced six balls between them.'Vic Marks, writing for the Guardian, was critical of the Cardiff collapse.Before the action unfolds, let us take a ride through the newspapers segment.The inclusion of a left-arm quick in Gurney will lend variety to the attack. Needless to say, the middle-order batsmen will have to pick themselves up and display better application against spin. Can the hosts strike back to equalize the series? If the first match is anything to go by, India will start as favorites at TB.CJ sprayed the ball all over the shop, the other multidimensional/ bits-and-pieces player in Stokes was not far behind either. Moreover, Cook let the Indians off the hook. In hindsight, he could have unleashed Jimmy on Raina early on. Whatever the problems maybe, England will have to sort them out quickly.England have more issues to ponder over. As Cook put it, they did not turn up, especially the batsmen. Swann's blunt assessment of England having a cat's chance in hell to win the World Cup has gathered more steam. Captain Cook finds himself back in the kitchen again. Did he get the XI right in Cardiff?With Rohit Sharma ruled out of the remainder of the tour because of a finger injury, M Vijay, has been drafted in as his replacement. The Tamil Nadu opener exhibited sound temperament in Tests, but his ODI career is yet to take off. Reports suggest that he will not reach England in time for the 3rd ODI. Will Rahane be bumped up to the top? For starters, Rahane has been guilty of throwing away his wicket, more so in the limited overs format. Rahane opening with Shikhar would also mean a possible entry for either Rayudu or Samson in the middle-order. Meanwhile, Kohli's agony has showed no signs of abating. Bhuvi, Mohit and Shami, however, were quite impressive, supporting the spin troika.Former India captain, Sunil Gavaskar, gushed that Raina's innings was among the best in overseas conditions. The southpaw re-established himself as the engine-room of the middle-order en route to his first three figure ODI score since 2010. The Men in Blue will aim to go for the jugular and ensure that all boxes are checked ahead of the 2015 World Cup. They will have to be wary of complacency though.Suresh Raina demonstrated a masterclass on pacing an ODI innings, MS Dhoni added another fifty to his beefy ODI CV and the spinners came to the party as India found some spark at the end of the tunnel after the gloom and doom of the Test surrender. To borrow from India's new team Director, 'it was just what the doctor ordered.'Preview by Bharath RamarajThe under-fire Indian unit put up a fine show in the second ODI at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, to thump hosts, England, by a humongous margin of 133 runs. The first game of the series at Bristol was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to incessant rain. With India registering a facile win in the second ODI, the hosts find themselves under pressure. England certainly need to show that tunnel-visioned aim to script a comeback in the ODI series.EnglandThe hosts, who ruled the roost in the Test series, came up a cropper in the second ODI. It was an abject poor performance from them. The bowlers lost the plot under pressure in the end overs, and the batsmen just didn't seem to have a clue of how to pace an innings, while chasing down a target in excess of 300. To make it even worse for the hosts, even the fielding wasn't up to the mark.It is imperative that England have a re-look at their bowling line-up. Chris Jordan looked short of international class in the second ODI. On occasions, Jordan has shone brightly as a wicket-taker in the shorter format of the game. However, he just hasn't been consistent enough. James Anderson, who has clearly been the shining light of England's pace attack in ODIs since World Cup 2011, was also was slightly below par. There were times when he drifted on the pads of the Indian batsmen. Yet, he has enough experience and the stamp of class to bounce back in the series.From England's perspective though, it was encouraging to see that Chris Woakes did land a few blows on the Indian line-up by taking wickets. Steven Finn, with his extra pace and bounce or Harry Gurney, the left-arm quick may replace Jordan for the next match. Gurney in particular, brings that variety to the line-up with his left-armer's angle.For many years now, England have struggled to chase down tall scores in excess of 300. They seem to press the panic button too early and lose their way. With the skipper himself, Alistair Cook, struggling to notch up big scores at a good strike rate, the middle-order usually finds itself under undue pressure. It is perhaps unfair to expect Alex Hales with just one ODI under his belt to carry England's batting line-up. For the likes of Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes to leave an indelible mark on the proceedings, the top-order has to fire on all cylinders.IndiaIndia, who looked battered and bruised during the Test series, played with renewed zest and vigour to win the second ODI. Suresh Raina, who has come under the scrutiny for not performing well away from the Asia, compiled his first ODI hundred outside Asia. The bowlers too bowled good lines and lengths, and with a big heart. The ground fielding was of acceptable standards.India was helped by the fact that Rohit Sharma to some extent was able to negate the threat of Anderson upfront. It also has to be said that MS Dhoni continues to be a pillar of strength in the middle-order, and he brings that assuredness to the Indian camp. However, unfortunately, Rohit has been ruled out of the rest of the ODI series with a fractured finger. Vijay, who did well in the Test series has been named as his replacement.Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan, who struggled to showcase their wares in the Test series, got out cheaply in the second match. Ajinkya Rahane did get a start, but wasn't able to convert it into a big one. Now, that is a bit of a worry for the Indian camp as they are key players and the team management will be hoping that they get amongst the runs soon.Going into the third ODI, it is crystal clear that England's batsmen still haven't worked out how to keep the scoreboard ticking by placing the ball into gaps against spinners. It has to be remembered that Ravindra Jadeja has outfoxed the opposition ranks many times in his ODI career. In fact, he averages 16.8 for his 20 wickets against England. Even in the last game at Bristol, he took four wickets for a mere 28 runs. It is a boon to have a good slow left-arm orthodox in the ODI format especially, against England. Jadeja bowls the right sort of pace for this format as well. Ashwin too gave a good account of himself in the last game.Among the pacers, Mohit Sharma bowled good lines to Alastair Cook by slanting it across the left-handed batsman. However, he perhaps needs to learn to make those subtle changes in length to deliver the coup de grace. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami were on the money on most occasions.Ground conditionsTrent Bridge, a ground steeped in history, has been known for assisting swing/seam bowlers over the years. The legend has it, the moist air from the Trent river across the ground leads to humid conditions. It is also believed that since Radcliffe stand came into existence in 1998, it has swung prodigiously. The logic for that is it has resulted in air circulation getting reduced.In recent times though, the track have favoured the batsmen. The much-improved sand-based drainage system has perhaps played a role in that regard. In fact, the track for the first Test match played between England and India turned out to be a featherbed. However, just like always, weather conditions can play a vital part in the preparation of the pitch in England. The forecast for the day is for light showers.Trivia# Alistair Cook needs 14 runs to reach the landmark of 3,000 ODI runs.#Joe Root required another 28 runs to complete 1,000 ODI runs.#India have won only one out of the four games they have played at the ground.QuotesThis knock is one of the most special ones for me given the circumstances and the conditions.
