Will get back as soon as the confirmation comes.There are still some wet patches around the square. There will be another pitch inspection at 1:50 am IST, says Peter Nero. The scheduled close is 2:20 am IST but the match can be extended until 3:00 am IST.There will be a pitch inspection at 1:30 am IST. We might be in for a reduced target under D/L method when the match eventually resumes.1:00 am IST: The sun is out and the covers have come-off, the square is not yet dry. It may take some more time for the match to resume.The ground-staff are finding it very difficult to get the secondary covers in place, the pitch has been well covered, but the square has been soaked with water.

They were checking whether Baugh crossed during the last dismissal, then they ruled that Baugh had to face. What a poor shot to play, especially when your captain is at the other end. The googly from Mishra and Baugh went for the expansive inside out hit, missed and the ball hit timber. Shambolic stuff from the Windies.

WEST INDIES:40.6  Munaf Patel to Sarwan, out Caught by Yusuf Pathan at deep mid wicket!! Sars departs and it is a WICKET MAIDEN!! for Munaf Patel. There was a bit of confusion whether it was a no-ball for height, but Nero and Gould reckon it was below the waist. A full toss and Sarwan swiped it high in the air, across the line, Yusuf came in and took it easily. Sarwan was waiting and asking the umpires for the no-ball, but it never came.

The selectors have decided to rest young Bravo and Pollard is in. Rotation policy is what the selectors have explained to Bravo. Guys are working hard and we are looking forward to do well.Raina: We would like to chase. The boys showed great character and responsibility. We are playing with the same team. We have played very well, young players want to do well playing for India.India have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report: There are some rough areas on the pitch, it certainly means that the pitch has not been watered. There are some indentations on the pitch, but it may not get worse as the match wears on. Expect the pitch to stay the same as in the 1st match and spinners will play a key role yet again reckons Jeff Dujon.Darren Sammy promised that his batsmen will cope better with the Indian spinners after their difficulty against the Pakistan spin attack. But the same old story continued as the batsmen failed to come to terms with the variations of Amit Mishra and Harbhajan Singh. Will West Indies do something better in the 2nd ODI? Hello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the 2nd One Day International between West Indies and India at Port of Spain. I am Pradeep, I will be joined by Ganesh and Srivathsa in a short while. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates.The preview by Gokul GopalAfter toiling to win the opening game against West Indies, India will look to better their efforts in the second game and aim for a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. West Indies, on the other hand, would have to come up with a more disciplined effort to overcome the tourists, who despite being without their senior players, have a lot of fire-power in the arsenal.How the teams fared:The Indian bowling was excellent in the first ODI as they choked the life out of the West Indian batsmen and forced them into submission. Dot balls were aplenty while there was a drought of boundaries when the West Indians were wielding the bat. Ramnaresh Sarwan and Marlon Samuels did score half-centuries, but the amount of time they took to get to that mark and their dismissals soon after reaching there, did not do much in boosting the Windies total. The Indians too had a laborious outing with the bat, needing to work hard to get to the target, which they eventually did thanks to fifties from Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan. Where the appreciation is due to the touring team is that the batsmen showed slightly better application in trying to adjust to the nature of the pitch and paced the innings intelligently to help their side emerge victors. The crowd would definitely not prefer watching either of these teams struggle for runs on a sloth like track, but the bowlers, especially the spinners, would not be complaining.What's in storeThe first ODI that India played against West Indies at the Queen's Park Oval stadium, Trinidad was very similar to the ODI series contested between the Caribbean team and Pakistan which took place recently. Slow pitches, scores less than 250 and batsmen struggling before getting to the target was the feature of the WI-Pak ODI series. Nothing different can be expected for the second game as it is very unlikely that these sides would encounter even a slight bit of green on the 22-yard track.Missing the big-hitters:Whatever be the nature of the pitch, when players like Virender Sehwag and Chris Gayle are out there in the middle, the track makes little difference. A perfect carnival would have been the sight of these flamboyant players in action, making the ball dance to the calypso beats. Sadly, an injured shoulder and weird selection policies have kept these two players out of the series, and their absence is very much like an important ingredient missing from an authentic Caribbean Rum. Having said that, the presence of Yusuf Pathan and Kieron Pollard does somewhat act as a solace.Out there to prove a point:Rohit Sharma: The talented youngster looked completely out of sorts in the first ODI at the start of his innings before settling down to play more diligently and finding form in the process. Having scored an unbeaten 68 in the first match, Rohit would be oozing with confidence and would also look forward to delivering consistent performances to cement his place in the power-packed Indian side.Marlon Samuels: The free-stroking West Indian, following a two-year ban, got to play in the series against Pakistan but did not render any note-worthy performance, barring a fifty in the second Test. Samuels initially struggled against India in the opening ODI, but he got back into the groove with a hard-working fifty. If he gets going in the same vein, the West Indian middle order would definitely be boosted.Quotes:We didn't score enough runs, we kept taking wickets but the total wasn't big enough to put pressure on them. It's about going out there and put a challenging total on the board but we couldn't do that: Darren Sammy, blamed the inability of his batsmen to put up enough runs on the board.The bowlers did a great job, followed by Rohit and Shikhar. The track wasn't good for batting, but we rotated the strike well. It's looking good at the moment, I hope we do well in the next game: Suresh Raina, lauded his teammates for an all-round display in the first ODI.Teams:West Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Devendra Bishoo, Darren Bravo, Andre Fletcher, Ravi Rampaul, Andre Russell, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo, Carlton Baugh(w), Anthony Martin, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Kirk EdwardsIndia (From): Suresh Raina(c), Harbhajan Singh, Ravichandran Ashwin, Subramaniam Badrinath, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Praveen Kumar, Amit Mishra, Munaf Patel, Parthiv Patel(w), Yusuf Pathan, Wriddhiman Saha, Ishant Sharma, Rohit Sharma, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay KumarLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
