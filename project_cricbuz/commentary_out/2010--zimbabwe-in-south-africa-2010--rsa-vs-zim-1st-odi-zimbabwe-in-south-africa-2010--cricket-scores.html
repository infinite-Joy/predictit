Zimbabwe looked a promising side in the T20s and would be raring to go against the Proteas. But things are looking ominous as dark clouds are hovering around the stadium. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info....Preview by Vishaal LoganathanWith the World Cup at the back of their minds, South Africa and Zimbabwe will be going into the first of the three ODIs looking to start the countdown to the big tournament in the sub continent in positive fashion. South Africa have already made a good start to their season by winning both their T20 matches and will be looking to hit the ground running in this match. They have been deprived of a few star players, losing the Morkels and Dale Steyn to injury among others. The loss of their front line bowlers might worry them but it will also give them an opportunity to test their bench strength. Even though Zimbabwe ended up on the losing side in both the T20 matches, their performance in especially the second match where they threatened to run away with the match before falling agonizingly short will give them hope and the confidence to pull off an upset.South Africa will definitely be favourites for not only this match but also to clean sweep the series. But Zimbabwe seem to be on an upward swing and their fearlessness might turn the tide in their favour. The Proteas did well to win both their T20 matches, but their bowling needs much improvement and much will depend on the youngsters to prove their mettle. Graeme Smith seemed as if he enjoyed the break from captaincy, his batting in the T20 was enough proof of the same; he will be back as captain for the ODI series, and his experience in that rank may just be what the bowlers need to perform well.The ODI Player of the Year, AB de Villiers will don the wicket keeping gloves and Juan 'Rusty' Theron is almost certain to make his debut in the absence of the injured Morne Morkel. Hashim Amla too returns and he will look to replicate the kind of form that saw him being nominated for the ICC Cricketer of the Year award.Zimbabwe will be buoyed by the return of Grant Flower and his inclusion will add steel to the Zimbabwean batting line up. After two good batting displays against a much stronger side, the confidence to put up or chase down a competitive score will be there for the side. Chamu Chibhabha was in superb form and belted 2 impressive half centuries, and the Zimbabweans will again look for him to star with the bat. Grant Flower's return has attracted quite a bit of news and the experienced batsman will want to show the world he still has what it's got to compete with the best.Zimbabwe's bowling attack is their weak link, their inability to take regular wickets or stem the flow of runs cost them both the T20 games. Against a very good batting line up, the bowling will have to be at their best if they want to pull of a win or at least run the South Africans close.The Proteas will look to extend their dominance over their neighbours having only lost twice in 29 matches played between the 2 nations. Smith will want his boys to start the ODI season with a resounding win. Zimbabwe's resurgence of late has been good and a win against their more esteemed opponents will be the shot in the arm the team needs to regain some of its lost glory. The Zimbabweans can look up to the Bangladeshis who pulled off 3 impressive wins over a much stronger New Zealand side in the ODI format.Teams:South Africa (From): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Colin Ingram, Jean-Paul Duminy, AB de Villiers(w), David Miller, Johan Botha, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Juan Theron, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Robin Peterson, Jacques Kallis, Charl LangeveldtZimbabwe (From): Brendan Taylor, Hamilton Masakadza, Chamu Chibhabha, Sean Williams, Grant Flower, Tatenda Taibu(w), Elton Chigumbura(c), Graeme Cremer, Prosper Utseya, Shingirai Masakadza, Ed Rainsford, Craig Ervine, Keith Dabengwa, Chris Mpofu, Ian NicolsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
