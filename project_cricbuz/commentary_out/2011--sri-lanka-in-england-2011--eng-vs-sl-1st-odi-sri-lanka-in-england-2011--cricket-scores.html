Cook will hope for a good start to his stint.Hello all, and welcome to the 1st ODI between England and Sri Lanka from Kennington Oval, London. England strolled through the Test series and if not for rain might even have won it 3-0. Sri lanka are a different team in the shorter form of the game though. They proved it with a comprehensive 9-wicket victory in the one-off T-20 on Saturday. Today is the last time one will see Sanath Jayasuriya in Sri Lankan colours and he will be hoping to exit on a high. I am Pradeep and I will bring you all the action as it happens. Thiru will be on the scoring duties for the day.Preview by Siddharth VishwanathanWith the disappointment of the Test series behind, Sri Lanka would be looking for a new beginning in the ODI series. Their performance during their recent victory in the T20 match at Bristol would have made England very nervous indeed. The tour has followed a pattern that is almost similar to their previous visit in 2006. After Sri Lanka won the T20 by a small margin, they soundly whitewashed England 5-0 in the ODI series. England would be desperate to avoid a repeat of that scenario and come out with all guns blazing. England will also be wanting to get back at Sri Lanka after the Lankans destroyed their World Cup aspirations with a resounding 10 wicket win in the quarter-finals. England may have won the Test series, but in colored clothing, they have been woefully out of form. Alastair Cook, the new ODI skipper, will have to come up with some new tactics to defeat a Sri Lankan team that thrives in the ODI scenario. He will be boosted by the return of Bresnan, who missed the Tests and the T20 with a calf muscle strain. With the poor show of the bowlers in the T20 match, Cook would be tempted to bring back Bresnan immediately. Broad and Swann will be the key men to back Bresnan up. The return of Samit Patel to the team will also raise a question on the composition of the squad ahead of the first ODI. The Oval is a dry pitch that assists spinners, but knowing Sri Lanka's prowess against the spinners, Cook might not want to try out two spinners.With Cook at the top of the order, and with the return of Pietersen into the fold, England's batting looks strong. However, Cook has not played an ODI for close to a year and England will want their captain to get back in good form. He will be partnered by Kieswetter, an explosive batsmen who will look to get England off to a flier. With Pietersen, Bell, Trott propping up the middle order, Sri Lanka will have a tough job on their hands. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, were simply awesome in the T20. The return of Malinga, Randiv and Kulasekara into the squad has changed the dynamics of the Sri Lankan side completely. Malinga's variation was too much to handle for the inexperienced England batting in the T20 and he will once again be a handful at the Oval. The new ball attack is has a good blend of youth and experience. Dhammika Prasad and Nuwan Kulasekara will be an interesting combination. Kulasekara will be a handful in English conditions with the ball moving around. Angelo Mathews' all-round abilities will be crucial for Sri Lanka's progress in this series. With the retirement of Muralitharan, the spin department looks weak. However, Randiv has shown that he is capable of building pressure. Jayasuriya, who will be playing his last match in cricket, can also be counted on to spin a web around England's batsmen. The top order will rely on Mahela Jayawardene and Dilshan to give Sri Lanka a great start. Dilshan has not played any cricket since breaking his thumb in his epic knock of 193 at Lords. Dilshan was the one who destroyed England the previous time they met in ODIs and he will be looking to dish out more punishment. Kumar Sangakkara and Thilina Kandamby are vital cogs in the middle order, but Sri Lanka have always been hampered by a weak lower middle order and England will be going all out to exploit that. However, all eyes will be on Jayasuriya. He is coming back to the venue where he helped Sri Lanka create history 13 years ago. He blitzed away to a cracking double century to set up a famous Test win for Sri Lanka. He came back in 2006 and scored 122. To make the Oval is own, he also picked up three wickets in the match. The 'Matara Mauler' will be looking to sign off on a high and leave a lasting impression among English fans for a long time to come.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Jonathan Trott, Jade Dernbach, Chris Woakes, Samit Patel, Craig Kieswetter(w), Ravi Bopara, Tim BresnanSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene, Suraj Randiv, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Thissara Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Thilina Kandamby, Sanath Jayasuriya, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dhammika PrasadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
