ZIMBABWE:49.6 49.6Bhuvneshwar to Chigumbura, 1 run, India have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. Disappointing end for Zimbabwe. Chigumbura's both ODI hundreds have now resulted in defeats, which is very sad to know. He took the risk of not taking a run earlier but the ploy didn't work. Bhuvi held his nerve and got the yorker right when needed and Chigumbura could only drive it along the ground to long-on
ZIMBABWE:49.5 Bhuvneshwar to Chigumbura, no run, driven straight to cover. Oh dear! This is not good for Zimbabwe, two dots and they need six off the last ball. Chigumbura drove that very hard but picked out the fielder to perfection

ZIMBABWE:48.6 D Kulkarni to Cremer, out Caught by Binny!! What have you done Cremer? Absolutely needless! That ends an excellent 86-run stand and more importantly gives India a sniff. Low full toss outside leg stump, Cremer plays the fancy looking reverse sweep, but mistimes it, point runs forward and takes an easy catch. Zimbabwe would hope that this moment does not turn things in favour of India. Cremer c Binny b D Kulkarni 27(36) [4s-2]D Kulkarni to Cremer, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Slower delivery on the leg stump, Chigumbura nudges this to mid-wicket. He takes his helmet off, roars and then swings his bat in joy. He knows that the job is yet to be done though. In fact, this is the second consecutive hundred for Chigu in ODIs

Can the bowlers now come to the party and defend the total? We'll soon find out as the Indians make their way out to the middle. Sibanda and Chibhabha are the opening batsmen for the hosts. The former will take strike first up. Bhuvi to start off proceedings. He has a couple of slips in place. Here we go...In the process, Rayudu recorded his second ODI hundred, while Binny registered his maiden ODI fifty. The 160-run record stand for the 6th wicket has helped India get to a competitive total. Chamu Chibhabha, with figures of 10-2-25-2, was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts. The pitch is not all that easy to bat on and the run chase is going to be interesting. Join us back at 13:15 local for all the action.Murali Vijay, Manoj Tiwary, Robin Uthappa and Kedar Jadhav, who were making a comeback into the ODI side failed miserably as they managed scores of 1, 2, 0 and 5 respectively. Stuart Binny joined Rayudu at the crease and played sensibly before the duo took the attack to the bowlers. This was the first time they batted together in ODIs and they registered a hundred partnership.After being asked to bat first, India did not get off to the best of starts as Vijay edged Vitori to second slip. Rahane and Rayudu then steadied the innings with a fifty partnership, but the former threw it away soon after as Masakadza took a sharp catch at first slip. Soon, from 60/1, India slumped to 87/5 as Zimbabwe bowled a tight line.4

Now we need to post a good score. The wicket looks good, there is some moisture, it should remain good throughout the 100 overs.'Chigumbura: 'We will bowl first. It's a good wicket to chase scores. The first hour will be crucial, need to make the most of the movement available. We need to play our best cricket in all departments. Hopefully, we will have a good day today.'Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: 'It looks like a fantastic ODI pitch, but it's very cold. There will be some help for the bowlers early on, with the early start. The captain winning the toss might choose to bowl first,' reckons Ed Rainsford.This is the first ODI where the new rules would come into effect. There need not be two catchers in the first 10 overs. There is no batting powerplay. Five fielders can be outside the circle for the last ten overs (41-50). How will these changes affect the teams? Stay tuned as the toss and teams are coming up in a short while...It is the first series for Zimbabwe at home since Dav Whatmore took over the coaching responsibilities. They have a decent side even though Brendan Taylor retired and went on to become a Kolpak player in the English county circuit. They have the experience in Elton Chigumbura, Hamilton Masakadza, Prosper Utseya and Sean Williams. They have a good bunch of youngsters like Chamu Chibhabha, Regis Chakabva and Richmond Mutumbami, whom they can bank on. If they play to their potential, they can cause a problem or two to the new look Indian side.Robin Uthappa, Murali Vijay, Manoj Tiwary and Harbhajan Singh are few players making their comeback to the team. There are also newbies like Manish Pandey and Sandeep Sharma who will be looking forward to getting their first cap. Ambati Rayudu, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohit Sharma are the players retained from the Bangladesh tour. The side on paper looks strong, but can they deliver the goods?. Time will tell. It is also a very good opportunity for some of them to make a statement and claim a spot in the regular ODI team.After a humiliating series loss to Bangladesh, the Indians are back in action and they take on Zimbabwe in their own backyard. The new look India side has a few familiar faces returning to the side. MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and few others have been rested, while Ajinkya Rahane was handed over the captaincy. Remember he was dropped for the last two ODIs against Bangladesh, so it has been a topsy-turvy last few days. Nonetheless, the new India skipper has moved on from the previous series and his focus is on the current job on hand.Preview:With a majority of cricket aficionados kept occupied with the much publicized Ashes, an Indian side bereft of its star value was put through their paces in a practice session at the Harare Sports Club. The series may have been granted low-key status amidst the sheer volume of international cricket being played concurrently, but to those going through the drills in Zimbabwe, the tour is an opportunity to lay down a marker and stake a claim for the sterner tests to follow in a hectic season of cricket.If India win the three-match series in Zimbabwe, they will hold on to their second position on the ICC ODI Rankings. However, things are not as rosy as the table paints it. For India seek solutions to pertinent questions in the 50-over format following their shock defeat to Bangladesh last month. A slot in the middle-order, another for the all-rounder and the fast bowling places are all up for grabs. Even Ajinkya Rahane, captain for this tour, and arguably India's most improved batsman in 2014-15, was left out of the final two games in Bangladesh citing an inability to force the pace in the middle of the innings.For Zimbabwe cricket looking to reinvent itself, India's visit could not have come at a better time. While a tour by India will most certainly fill the coffers, there is also the added advantage of good performances getting a wider audience that could set off a chain reaction leading to more teams touring Zimbabwe with greater frequency. They have their hands full this season already with the India tour followed by a visit from New Zealand and a tri-series involving West Indies and Pakistan as they look to book a place in what is increasingly likely to be a 10-team 2019 World Cup.Start Date: 10th July 2015Time: 07:00 GMT, 12:30 ISTVenue: Harare Sports Club, HarareWeather: A sunny day with a high of 23 degree CelsiusTeam News:Zimbabwe:Despite not winning a single game in the series, Zimbabwe's tour of Pakistan was characterized by strong batting performances. In Elton Chigumbura, Hamilton Masakadza, Sikandar Raza and Chamu Chibhabha - they have four solid top-order batsmen capable of giving Zimbabwe sizable totals. The bowling though remains a worry, as it was during the World Cup encounter between these two sides, earlier this year. Tinashe Panyangara has often lacked support from the other end and the Zimbabwe think-tank could consider fielding Doanald Tiripano in the absence of Tawanda Mupariwa.Probable XI: Vusi Sibanda, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Elton Chigumbura (c), Sikandar Raza, Sean Williams, Regis Chakabva/ Richmond Mutumbami (wk), Graeme Cremer, Tinashe Panyangara, Brian Vitori, Donald TiripanoIndia:India have selection quandary themselves. The purpose of the tour is to identify players who could be called on to the main side for the marquee tournaments coming up. So every member of the squad is likely to get some game time. Playing both the all-rounders, Stuart Binny and Axar Patel, would result in playing one less specialist batsman or bowler. Robin Uthappa should partner Murali Vijay at the top of the order and double up as a wicket-keeper. Manish Pandey and Sandeep Sharma, in all likelihood, will make their India debut while one of Manoj Tiwary and Kedar Jadhav will take up the remaining batting slot.Probable XI: Murali Vijay, Robin Uthappa (wk), Manish Pandey, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Ambati Rayudu, Manoj Tiwary/ Kedar Jadhav, Axar Patel/ Stuart Binny, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Sandeep Sharma, Dhawal KulkarniStats and Trivia:- India have won 10 of the 15 ODIs played in Harare since 1992.- India last toured Zimbabwe in 2013. Then, a Virat Kohli-led side swept the series 5-0Quotes:"The only way we can improve is by competition.India are a strong side and we will be looking to continue improving."- Zimbabwe Coach Dav Whatmore said he was a hopeful of the team continuing on its progressive path"Only after the first game we'll develop an idea about what sorts of strategies we need to use for the new rules."- Ajinkya Rahane opined that the new fielding restrictions and free-hits for all no balls would be exciting.Teams:India (From): Murali Vijay, Robin Uthappa(w), Ajinkya Rahane(c), Ambati Rayudu, Kedar Jadhav, Manoj Tiwary, Harbhajan Singh, Axar Patel, Dhawal Kulkarni, Stuart Binny, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Sandeep Sharma, Manish PandeyZimbabwe (From): Regis Chakabva(w), Elton Chigumbura(c), Sikandar Raza, Graeme Cremer, Neville Madziva, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Richmond Mutumbami, Tinashe Panyangara, Vusi Sibanda, Donald Tiripano, Prosper Utseya, Brian Vitori, Malcolm Waller, Sean WilliamsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
