New Zealand have amassed a substantial total on the board. Can Sri Lanka overhaul the target and make a comeback? Remember, they lost the first two games of the five-match series.Santner then took the onus of playing the anchor's role for New Zealand. Ronchi couldn't give him company for long and Santner himself perished a few minutes later, but not before he made 38 off 46 balls. Bracewell, Milne then added a few handy runs before Tim Southee finished with a flourish to propel the hosts to a competitive total. The Sri Lankans need to win this game to stay in the series. Can they do it? Join us in 30 minutes or so to find out.With 276 runs on the board, New Zealand will be the happier side going into the break.

Stay tuned for toss and teams...Hello and a warm welcome to the third ODI between New Zealand and Sri Lanka. The tourists will look to put the humiliating loss at Christchurch behind them and prove their mettle in the crucial third game. On the other hand, New Zealand have shown that despite missing key players, they have enough bench strength to emerge victorious at home. Martin Guptill has been in tremendous touch. He even came close to breaking the record for the fastest ODI century in the last match. Henry, McClenaghan and Bracewell have all been among the wickets.Preview:New Zealand and Sri Lanka will meet in Nelson on Thursday (December 31) for the third ODI in the final international fixture of 2015. The two teams couldn't have had more contrasting years. While New Zealand made giant strides across formats to establish themselves as a genuine powerhouse of the sport, Sri Lanka grappled with the loss of batting stalwarts and have been in a perpetual state of transition. This particular tour of New Zealand has already seen everything from failed drug tests to a beeline of players heading to the treatment table, with lead pacer Lasith Malinga becoming the latest to be ruled out of the tour. Angelo Mathews began the year with a Test and ODI series defeat in New Zealand and runs the risk of ending the year with an encore at the Saxton Oval unless he can inspire his beleaguered side to turn the series around. The manner of their 'humiliating 'defeat in Christchurch - New Zealand chased down 117 in under nine overs - would suggest that salvaging anything from the series appears far from probable. However, when faced with a similar predicament in the Test series, Sri Lanka put on a spirited effort in Hamilton and with a little application, stood a chance to level the series. The popular belief is that in a series where so much has gone wrong, things can only get better. However, sport is no place for popular beliefs. Negative spirals can be difficult to get out of and the experienced heads in the side - Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mathews and Nuwan Kulasekara - will now be tasked to lift a bunch of drooping heads in the side. Notwithstanding their almost non-existent batting, Sri Lanka's bowling has left much to be desired and young Dushmantha Chameera's fixation with the short-pitch deliveries after his success in the Hamilton Test hasn't boded well in the limited overs. Kulasekara and his fellow medium pacers will have to exercise some control at the top of the order for Sachithra Senanayake and Jeffrey Vandersay to have any impact in the middle overs. New Zealand, who have not lost a game all series, will fancy their chances to put the ODI series to bed in Nelson. The last time the two sides played each other at this venue, a Kane Williamson century eclipsed the Sangakkara-Jayawardene show as the hosts chased down 276 in a canter. The 25-year-old Williamson is expected to return from injury to lead the side with Brendon McCullum sidelined due to a back injury. Tim Southee and Adam Milne have been passed fit to play but Trent Boult has been penciled in for a return only in the fifth ODI. Matt Henry, the hosts' best bowler in the series so far, strangely finds himself left out of the squad.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Doug Bracewell, Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, George WorkerSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Danushka Gunathilaka, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Dushmantha Chameera, Jeffrey Vandersay, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Kithuruwan VithanageLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
