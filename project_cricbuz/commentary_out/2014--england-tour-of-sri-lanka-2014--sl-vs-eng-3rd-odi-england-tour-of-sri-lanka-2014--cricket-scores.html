Tough for them and cricket in general (referring to Hughes' funeral). We would have batted first as well. The stats say that this is a high scoring ground. We have 3 changes. Hales comes in at Number 3, Stokes and Jordan come in as well. Tredwell, Gurney and Bell have been left out. It is a great opportunity for the boys. It is more frustrating for me than anybody. I will have to score runs at the top."Mathews: "We all pray that he (Hughes) rests in peace. I will have a bat first. It looks like a dry wicket. We want to put runs on the board and defend it. Mahela is out for personal reasons, Kandamby is back. It is a tough job for the curators to prepare wickets with these conditions. We are playing four spinners."Pitch report: "It is very steamy here. We have had scattered showers. This is dry and hard - the usual Hambantota pitch. With the new ball, there may be uneven bounce. The captain winning the toss should bat first without any hesitation" says Russel ArnoldEngland make three changes, Hales, Stokes and Jordan come in for Bell, Gurney and Tredwell. Sri Lanka as expected bring in Kandamby for Mahela.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews(c), Thilina Kandamby, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Dhammika Prasad, Rangana Herath, Ajantha MendisEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Moeen Ali, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, Steven FinnSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batMahela Jayawardene has opted out of this game due to personal reasons and Thilina Kandamby is expected to make a return to the ODI side after three years.Weather Watch: The first two matches had rain interruptions. However, thanks to the groundsmen and the excellent facilities in the Premadasa, we did not lose many overs. There is rain predicted later on, but as of now, there are clear blue skies and the sun is out at Hambantota.England need to find a way to adapt to the conditions and perform better, especially against spin. Can they manage to do that today in Hambantota? Hello and welcome to the third ODI. Stay tuned as we are close to the toss time..Cook can take a leaf from the experienced trio of Dilshan, Sanga and Mahela, who have stood up and performed in the first two matches making Mathews' work very easy. The spin duo of Tredwell and Moeen Ali have not done much against a strong batting line-up, while Herath and Co. have spun a web around the English batsmen.Sri Lanka have turned it around brilliantly after their 5-0 whitewash against India, whereas England are still struggling to find their right combination. Alastair Cook looks woefully out of form in the 50-over format and with voice picking up for him to step down, it is up to him to stand up and lead by example.Preview by Bharath RamarajWith Sri Lanka winning the first two games of the seven-match ODI series against England, the visitors will look to show their mettle and emerge victorious in the third match to be played at Hambantota.On the other hand, the hosts would be delighted with getting back to winning ways especially, after they were clobbered 5-0 in India. Their top-order batsmen like Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara have been among the runs and their spinners with flight and guile have had England in a lot of trouble.EnglandThe visitors have been mainly let down by veteran batsmen, Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, who continue to wallow in the morass of mediocrity. Field restrictions, shorter boundary lengths, two new balls and fantastic bats have led to teams putting up monstrous scores on the board. However, ODI games are still based on the old maxim of top-order batsmen erecting a platform for the middle-order to cash in and accelerate in the end overs.To make it worse, both Cook and Bell have time and again got out in a similar manner. For instance, in the first ODI, Bell, for the umpteenth time, followed a back of a length delivery outside the off-stump to edge it to the slip cordon.When a team loses wickets upfront, it becomes doubly difficult for middle-order to come to the party, as the batsmen have to steady the ship and then only look to explore every nook and cranny of the ground with their wide array of shots. There is no doubt that England need to play James Taylor. Taylor is gift-wrapped with the ability to play power-packed shots. In short, one can test a youngster's temperament only if he is given the chance to play. On a positive note, Moeen Ali, shone brilliantly by notching up a dazzling hundred in the first ODI and Ravi Bopara has been in fine form. England's bowlers too have struggled to give a good account of themselves. In the absence of James Anderson and Stuart Broad, they lack the wisdom of experience and a fair bit of skill to keep the opposition in check.Steven Finn can generate a decent steam of pace, but Chris Woakes, James Tredwell and Harry Gurney perhaps lack the penetration to do well on flat decks. To make it worse for England, they conceded 17 wides in the first game.Sri LankaThe hosts have bounced back rather well after putting up an enervated show in India. It has to be said though, playing India in India is always a tough proposition and even before this series started, not many expected England to come to grips with the conditions in Sri Lanka and perform.At top of the order, Dilshan and Sangakkara have been consistent performers. Even Kusal Perera, the southpaw, played a mettlesome knock in the first game. However, Sri Lanka would feel the absence of Mahela Jayawardene, as the veteran batsman will miss the third game due to personal reasons.In the bowling department, the spinners, Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Ajantha Mendis and even Jeevan Mendis have troubled the English batsmen from time-to-time. They have taken the advantage of England's age-old weakness against spinners.England's batsmen also found it tough to pick Thisara Perera's length in the first ODI. He has a slingy action and when Perera especially, delivers the surprise short pitched delivery, the weight transfer of English batsmen seem to be a fraction too late. Angelo Mathews' captaincy has been praiseworthy as he has shown acute tactical awareness.Pitch and weather conditionsWeather forecast points to a thunderstorm in the afternoon. In the first few games played at Hambantota during the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 and World T20 2012, the track offered decent carry for the pacers. But it is hard to envisage groundsmen preparing a track to suit the opposition's strengths. It also has to be said that the outfields in Sri Lanka have generally quickened up in recent times. However, rain may play spoilsport.QuotesIt will be good to get out of Colombo and start again. Credit to Sri Lanka. It is a seven-match series and we can bounce back: Alastair Cook, England's skipper, after they lost the second ODI.It feels great. The bowlers set the tone for us. We still can improve: Angelo Mathews, Sri Lanka's captain, brimming with confidence after they emerged victorious in the second game.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, James Tredwell, Steven Finn, Harry Gurney, Ben Stokes, James Taylor, Chris Jordan, Alex HalesSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Dhammika Prasad, Rangana Herath, Ajantha Mendis, Shaminda Eranga, Thilina Kandamby, Lahiru Gamage, Dilruwan PereraLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
