NEW ZEALAND:8.4  Senanayake to Munro, SIX, David Warner will be proud of that shot, the switch-hit. Fantastic hit from Munro. Senanayake helped him by firing this down the leg side, since he changed the grip of the bat, he was able to slog it handsomely over mid-wicket

Elliott st Sangakkara b Senanayake 7(14) [4s-1] Senanayake to Elliott, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!Elliott is surely out stumped. But the square leg umpire wants to be sure.

Here we go for the first ball....New Zealand will have to bat really well to win this game. Sri Lanka have added 21 runs in 14 balls as the groundsmen did a great job in getting the ground play-fit after a 5-hour rain break. New Zealand need 198 in 23 overs according to D/L. The hosts wouldn't mind this target and would back themselves to defend this. The onus is on the Kiwi batsmen now, do not take your eyes off this game. The second innings is about to begin in a short while.2
SRI LANKA:22.6  Ellis to Sangakkara, 1 run, the extra ball has not cost New Zealand much. Must say that this is a sensational last over from Ellis, shortish delivery following the batsman outside off stump, Sangakkara edges the scoop onto his grill and it rolls behind square to short fine leg

Here we go with the first ball....Mills: "It is overcast so it will swing a bit. Yes, it would be nice to bowl more balls like the first one in the last match. Anderson is injured and Neehsam comes in and I forgot the other change. We will play some positive cricket."Mathews: "We will have a bat first. It looks like a really good track. It might get slower and lower. We will put some runs. We should have put up 300 in the last game. We are playing the same team."Pitch Report: "It is very overcast. There is lot less grass on this wicket than the previous game and there are a few cracks as well. There was rain last night so there will be some moisture. It will be slower and will help the spinners. It will be interesting to see what the captains do when they win the toss", says Alistair CampbellTeams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Tom Latham, Anton Devcich, Rob Nicol, Grant Elliott, Colin Munro, Luke Ronchi(w), Jimmy Neesham, Nathan McCullum, Andrew Ellis, Kyle Mills(c), Adam MilneSri Lanka (Playing XI): Dimuth Karunaratne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Rangana Herath, Lasith MalingaSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batHello and welcome to the second ODI in Hambantota. The first match was washed out after Sri Lanka put up a challenging total on the board. The hosts who are playing international cricket after a while did not look rusty at all. Dilshan, Sangakkara and Matthews registered fine fifties. They were also given a good start with the ball by Malinga who got rid off Devcich in his first over. On the other hand, New Zealand are a relatively inexperienced and are missing some of their key players like Taylor, Brendon McCullum and Williamson. There is a rain threat to this game as well, let's hope that we get a full game. The toss in a few minutes, stay tuned....PreviewA rain cloud hangs over the second ODI in Hambantota after the first match was abandoned at the same venue. Nevertheless, both teams will be looking to approach it without any let up in intensity. In what is now just a two-match shootout, both teams will be eager to grab the early advantage. Duckworth/Lewis could play a big factor in the game if the rain does come in late. Batting first could be the way forward for the team winning the toss. Sri Lanka:The hosts had the better of the rain affected first ODI. The big guns, Sangakkara, Dilshan and Mathews scored fine fifties to propel Sri Lanka to a handsome total. While it would please the team management that the seniors are doing well, what would please them more would be if any of the youngsters performed. Lahiru Thirimanne and Dinesh Chandimal, who batted lower than Mathews in the previous game will need more time in the middle to prove their mettle. Sri Lanka will have to put any plans of rotation to rest for now until they are out of danger of losing the series. Their bowling line up is an experienced one and promises to hold a lot of challenges to the inexperienced New Zealand batting line up. New Zealand:After the drubbing against Bangladesh, the visitors will need an inspiring performance from someone. While they usually look up to players like Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum for such innings, their absence adds to their woes. One glance at the batting line up tells a tale of inexperience and brittleness. The lack of exposure could be made to work to their advantage and New Zealand have historically revelled when tagged as underdogs. The bowling department will have to put on an improved show after the first ODI. Stand-in skipper, Kyle Mills will have to take it upon himself to chart the way for his lesser experienced colleagues. Stats:* Sri Lanka have won 5 out of the 10 games they've played at Hambantota * 3 of the last four games in Hambantota have been abandoned due to rain Quotes:That T20 win in Bangladesh gave us a lot of confidence.
