It's time for the national anthems.Teams:England (Playing XI): Ian Bell, Alex Hales, James Taylor, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, Stuart Broad, James AndersonAfghanistan (Playing XI): Nawroz Mangal, Javed Ahmadi, Afsar Zazai(w), Nasir Jamal, Samiullah Shenwari, Shafiqullah Shafiq, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Dawlat Zadran, Shapoor Zadran, Hamid HassanEngland have won the toss and have opted to fieldMorgan: 'Couple of days after that Bangladesh game, we got together and talked. We want to win this game and finish the tournament with a win. We are going to bowl. It rained a bit this morning and it's overcast. The wicket does look good, so will get the first opportunity with the ball. There are two injuries. Unfortunately Woakes and Ali are missing out, Tredwell and Bopara come in. A performance will be nice, but want to win.'Nabi: 'We have enjoyed the whole tournament so far. We have also taken a bit of experience from the big teams. We would have bowled as well, it rained a little in the morning. We will try to perform well in this game. There will be something for the fast bowlers in the first few overs, but after that it will be a flat wicket. We haven't performed well with the bat. We want to finish the tournament in a good manner.'Even though England lost their last game to Bangladesh, it will be unwise to count them out of this game as well. They are the favourites to win this, but Afghanistan won't make it easy for them. It should be a good contest. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.Weather Report: The rain has stopped but it is quite cloudy in Sydney right now. There's some rain expected today, but we should be able to get a game in. The maximum temperature is expected to be around 23 degrees Celsius. Let's just hope that the rain gods stay away. Fingers crossed!Team News: Moeen Ali and Chris Woakes are injured and won't be able to take part in this game. Ali has a side strain and Woakes has an injury in his left foot. Alex Hales is expected to open the innings today in Ali's absence. Apart from that, Tredwell and Bopara might get a game as well.Eoin Morgan, the English captain was very disappointed with his team's performance in the last game. After the game, he said, 'I am gutted at the moment. We've struggled and fought and fought our way since we arrived here. The big thing was to fight very hard to try and get through to the quarterfinals and from there fight our way through the last three games, but obviously that was not meant to be.''Since we've landed in Australia, we have tried to address that problem, it hasn't worked. Our expectations are a lot higher than the way we perform, so that's extremely disappointing. To be knocked out this early is disappointing. To be honest, I have no idea what happens from here,' he added.EnglandThe media crackdown on England after their loss against Bangladesh has been severe. England were expected to reach the quarter-final stage, but their performance in this World Cup has been miserable. It amazes me that the country that invented the game, has just won 1 out of 5 games. In fact, England's coach, Peter Moores' comment after the game, where he said: 'We'll have to look at the data', was criticised by media, former players and experts all around. Their dependency on stats, more than cricketing common sense, is bewildering.Like Afghanistan, England's only win in the tournament came against the Scots, a game that they won by 119 runs. However, apart from that one instance, England's World Cup campaign has just been disastrous. Ideally, they will want to go out with a win, but they will be wary of the Afghan challenge as well. The Englishmen have been outplayed by most of their teams from Pool A and Afghanistan won't give up without putting up a fight. Eoin Morgan's men might not be in the best frame of minds, but they will have to go out today and take the field. For them, the challenge is not just about how they cope up with the other team, but how mentally tough they are.AfghanistanEven though Afghanistan have just won one game in the tournament, their intent on the field has earned them praise from all quarters. A team that has won hearts all around, will now look to upset their English counterparts, who have also won only one of their games prior to this. Afghanistan's only win in the tournament came against the Scots, a match that went down to the wire, with Afghanistan winning by just a wicket in the end. In their last game, they showed their 'never back down' spirit as they posted 186 on the board, after being 59/6 at one stage. This performance against New Zealand, a team that haven't lost even a single game in the World Cup so far, was lauded by former cricketers.Now, the Blue Tigers will look to finish the tournament on the high. It is a great opportunity for them as they will be playing a team, which won't be very high on confidence. For the Afghans, it is important that they build partnerships while batting, something that they haven't been consistent with. If they manage to keep wickets in hand against England, they can put them under pressure. However, they will still start the game as underdogs, but Bangladesh's win in the last game, will give them a belief, belief that they can pull off an improbable win here.12:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: England were knocked out by Bangladesh in the last game, making this game inconsequential, in terms of qualification for the quarter-finals. However, England will now look to play for some pride before they make their way back home. On the other hand, Afghanistan have nothing to lose at all. They will be up against a side, that was expected to reach the next stage, but faltered in their way. For the Afghans, England will be under a lot of pressure to at least win this game comfortably and if the Blue Tigers can pull off a win here, it will be a historic moment for them. However, the conditions aren't that great as it rained in the morning. The pitch and the square are covered. The good thing is that the rain has stopped, but it is still very gloomy. Before we move further, let's take a look at how both the teams have done recently. Preview: It might be a game that's a dead rubber on paper, but for England and Afghanistan the game would be largely significant. England and Afghanistan are both out of the reckoning for a spot in the quarterfinals, with both teams taking up positions five and six in Pool A. Both teams have won once, against lowly Scotland. While Afghanistan's one-wicket defeat of Scotland was the latest chapter in a remarkable rise that has taken them from the lowest rung of international cricket to the game's showpiece tournament in barely seven years, for England victory over their neighbours couldn't salvage another wretched World Cup.Both team will be looking at this game to end their campaigns on a winning note. Team News: England:England's 15-run defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide condemned them to a first round exit without having won a single pool match against a Test nation -- the first time they've suffered this 'double whammy' in the 40-year history of the World Cup. After Monday's match, England coach Peter Moores was widely mocked for saying "we shall have to look at the data", with many pundits saying it was emblematic of a backroom regime where cricketing common sense had been swept aside by statistical analysis. The brickbats will only increase should they succumb to Afghanistan.Chris Woakes and Moeen Ali have been ruled out with a left foot injury and a side strain respectively. This should allow them to test out Alex Hales at the top. There have been calls for Hales' inclusion at the top of the order since the start of the tournament, but England only brought him in in the defeat to Bangladesh. Hales now has the chance to show why England would have been better off if they'd listened to the endless calls supporting his addition to the side.James Tredwell, too, could find himself in the playing XI as the specialist spinner, while Ravi Bopara could take up the all-rounder's spot in the middle order.Probable XI: Alex Hales, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, James Taylor, Jos Buttler, Ravi Bopara, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad, James Tredwell, James Anderson.Player to watch out for: Alex Hales - Everyone in England seems to have gone hoarse calling for Alex Hales to be included in the side. His inclusion came a little too late, but the big-hitting top-order batsman will still have to prove why he has been so heavily backed. Afghanistan:The Afghanistan story has been everyone's favourite this World Cup. They created history by claiming their first ever World Cup win, against Scotland, and they will hope to go out on a high by upsetting a top Test playing like England and show the world that they belong. Samiullah Shenwari has been their side's best batsman, aggregating 247 runs at an average that's almost touching fifty and he will be hoping to end the tournament with another top-notch performance. Afghanistan's bowlers have been the ones to make everyone sit up and take notice of the World Cup newbies. Hamid Hasan, Shapoor Zadran and Dawlat Zadran form a troika that can wreak havoc, and they will hope to put on another strong display before bidding goodbye to the World Cup.Probable XI: Javed Ahmadi, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi, Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai, Gulbadin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor Zadran.Player to watch out for: Shapoor Zadran - The lanky pacer has taken 10 wickets so far in the World Cup. Against an England side that will be nervous after their unexpected defeat to Bangladesh, the left-armer will be hoping he can run riot.Stats and Trivia:-> This is first time England have failed to beat a Test playing nation in a World Cup.-> This is the first time Afghanistan and England face each other in an ODI.-> England's ever-present pace trio of James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes has combined to take 12 wickets. New Zealand's Trent Boult and Tim Southee have both bettered that tally alone.Quotes:Paul Farbrace: If losing the game to Bangladesh was terrible, we couldn't possibly imagine what it will be like if tomorrow goes against us. That would be horrendous.Andy Moles: They (England) are not in the best of nick at the moment and we still believe that, if at the top of the order with the bat especially, we just need to show a bit more composure, we've still got a scare in us.Teams:England (From): Ian Bell, Alex Hales, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(k), Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad, James Tredwell, Steven Finn, James Anderson, Ravi BoparaAfghanistan (From): Javed Ahmadi, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai(k), Gulbadin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor Zadran, Usman Ghani, Shafiqullah Shafiq, Aftab Alam, Nasir JamalLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
