The revised target will be 295 from 47 overs and play will start at 11 30 ISTThe covers are still on at Cardiff but the rain seemed to have stopped. The Indians are on the ground doing their drills and getting warmed up.It was a perfectly paced ODI innings from India. The openers got decent starts but both fell in quick succession. A sensible stand between Dravid and Kohli followed. The duo started slowly but paced their partnership superbly to add 170 runs. Dravid finished his ODI career with a half century, while Kohli carried on to silence his critics with a superb century. Both of them fell towards the end of the innings but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise for India, as the skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni slammed a blazing half century to power them over 300. Surely, this has to be enough to win a match! But, you never know. So join us in a while for the run chase to see if it will be England, India... or the rain!Hold your celebrations Indian fans, I've got some bad news for you. It is raining! Not sure how heavy it is and how many overs we could lose, if at all we do, but England will not mind the rain at all.4

Jadeja c Bopara b Dernbach 0(1) Dernbach to Jadeja, THATS OUT!! Caught!!51 runs, 1 wicket: The powerplay story for India. Not so long ago, India had problems with this period of play.

England are reviewing it. No sound and looks like there is nothing on the hot spot. Ah, it looks a very close one. It looks like it may have brushed the glove, but nothing conclusive from any of the replays shown to us. "You can't give this out", says Ravi Shastri.

Loud cheer from the spectators at the stadium. The sky in Cardiff looks blue. Who'd believe that it was raining cats and dogs here just a few minutes back?The latest from Cardiff is that play will start at 14 40 local time i.e. 7:10 PM IST. The between innings break will be of 35 minutes.Just as we thought that the rains might prove to be a spoilsport, it seems to have subsided quite a bit. The groundsmen are busy sweeping the water off the covers. The official news is that the start will be delayed by 24 minutes i.e. at 7:00 PM IST.The news from the centre doesn't look good. It's raining very heavily. Alan Wilkins on air presumes that it will be a passing shower.Teams:England (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Jonathan Bairstow, Samit Patel, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Steven Finn, Jade DernbachIndia (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane, Parthiv Patel, Rahul Dravid, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Vinay Kumar, RP Singh, Munaf PatelSame old story again. Dhoni has lost 5 tosses in a row. Aptly sums up the luck for team India in this tour. And no Varun Aaron once again, so it will be Vinay Kumar, Munaf Patel and RP Singh, along with off spinner R Ashwin. Doesn't look a very strong attack, but you never know..Dhoni: Whatever I call is not working. Kumar replaces Kumar. Praveen Kumar has a problem with his ankle. He has had an excellent tour so it is well deserved rest. Due may have an effect as the game progresses. Dravid is a legend, in whatever format. He is the best- wicketkeeper batsman we have got as far as stats are concerned. It has not been easy but he even kept wickets when the team needed. It will be important to go back with a win. We were in a position to win at many points in the series but we can't control the weather.Cook: We will bowl. History suggests that the side batting 2nd wins more often. Anderson is rested. Stokes is out. Bairstow is a very attacking player and has had a good year. Hope he does well. It is great to captain a young team. It has been a good summer, hope to finish well. It is never a dead game when you play for England.England have won the toss and elected to fieldMS Dhoni hasn't won a toss in the ODI series so far. Will he finally break the jinx today? An interesting thing to note is that the team batting first have never won in the ODIs played so far at Cardiff.Pitch report: Overcast conditions. Typical Cardiff wicket. Looks very flat, although there is grass. A bat first wicket and under lights it will swing says Wasim Akram. According to him, if India win the toss should bat first.Rahul Dravid: I wasn't part of the WC winning side in 2011. So that's one box I didn't tick. I played with lots of players for a long time and it was great to see India winning. I knew it was a critical opportunity. I got a chance after a magnificent test series against NZ in 1999 and I stayed back. I made a hundred in the first game at Taupo. Then I went to the World Cup in England and made runs. Those six months in my mind established that I could've a successful ODI career. My wicket-keeping skills helped me in extending my career. It made more fitter and I concentrated a lot on my fitness from then. I was still able to adapt to the ODI format and play a significant amount of cricket - which is a higlight in itself.Praveen Kumar is already ruled out of the final ODI. So will that mean a debut ODI chance for Varun Aaron? We will know soon when the toss and the team will be announced. Do stay tuned for that.On a sadder note, we offer our deepest condolences to the family of Mohammad Azharuddin. His youngest son Ayazuddin passed away today after battling for his life for four days in a Hyderabad hospital. May his soul RIP.India have already lost in two countries - England and Ireland. Will they at least win a game in Wales? Welcome to the live coverage of the final ODI being played at the Swalec stadium in Cardiff. This is a final chance for India to salvage something from a miserable tour where everything has gone wrong for them. The weather is fine for now, but showers are expected later in the day.The Indian team has decided to give Rahul Dravid a fitting farewell by gifting him a special souvenir which has been brought in from India. Apparently the Indian team management decided to let Rahul Dravid captain the team for the first 10 overs of the game, to which Dravid politely declined saying the team's interests are paramount rather than him being captain. Shows what a team man he is.Sept 8th 2007: Rahul Dravid captained India for the last time in ODIs. Sept 16th 2011: Rahul Dravid will play his final ODI for India. Can India gift him a fitting farewell by winning a game on this dreadful tour? Or will Rahul Dravid retire from ODIs with a defeat - which would mean that India would finish an overseas tour without a win for the first time since 1989-90 - when they failed to win a single game against Pakistan.Preview by Gokul GopalWhile India will be heaving a sigh of relief that their nightmarish tour of England is heading to a finish, they would also be desperately hoping to leave the country with at least one win under their belt. There is also the added motivation to do well and give Rahul Dravid, playing his final ODI at Cardiff, a fitting farewell. The hosts, on the other hand, will not let India go off the hook easily. Having already clinched the ODI series, Alastair Cook would be expecting his team to finish off with yet another win.Rankings at stake: Apart from making it a memorable farewell for Dravid, India will be pumped up and will go all out for a victory as the ICC ODI rankings are at stake. If India lose the match, they would lose two rating points and slip to No. 5 in the ODI rankings. A win for England would mean that they would gain two rating points and rise to No 4 in the team rankings.India: Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men have performed spiritedly in the limited overs games despite not being able to taste any success. They came close to registering their first win of the tour at Lord's in their previous match. However, rain and Duckworth-Lewis had the final say and after several interruptions, the match ended up as a tie. But the eventual result of the 4th ODI aside, the Indian team, particularly the batsmen, have fared quite well. While Ajinkya Rahane and Parthiv Patel have provided good starts at the top, Suresh Raina and Dhoni have looked solid down the order and have also been involved in leading a couple of remarkable recoveries when the visitors lost wickets in a heap. Ravindra Jadeja also made an impression straightaway, after being drafted into the Indian side. His all-round effort in the third ODI earned him the Man of the Match award. Rahul Dravid and Virat Kohli are the ones short of runs in the ODIs. While Dravid's highest is the 32 he scored in the 2nd ODI, Kohli, apart from the 55 in the opening game, has not contributed much. It will be the final ODI match for 'The Wall' and he will be keen to give an all-out effort for one last time.The lack of penetration in the bowling attack has been one of the main reasons for India's failure in the England tour and that continued into the ODI series as well. Despite the batsmen performing well, the bowling lacked intent, resulting in India losing the second and the third ODIs. However, there has been some improvement since then with R Ashwin leading the pack to bring back some credibility to the Indian bowling. The off-spinner has combined well with Jadeja to keep the pressure on England, reaping the rewards by adding some wickets to his tally too. While RP Singh and Praveen Kumar have been amongst the wickets, they haven't been able to trouble England much. Munaf Patel has had an indifferent tour - looking good when trying to contain, but proving to be ineffective and expensive when going for the wickets. But Dhoni has backed Munaf despite several calls for dropping him and including Varun Aaron in his place. It is likely that the Indian skipper will persist with the same side for the final game unless he decides to rest a few players and test the bench.England: England have not been as flamboyant in the ODIs as they were in the Test series. However, they have been able to keep India from winning a single game thanks to some plucky performances from a few of the batters. Ravi Bopara came up with a valuable knock to get the home side through in the third ODI and his knock of 96 in the fourth ODI was the main reason that the match ended in a tie after India looked favourites at one stage. But England's main concern has been that their batsmen have not been able to convert starts to good scores and this has been the reason for them not being able to establish themselves as a premier limited overs side. While Jonathan Trott has not had the best of runs in the ODIs, the likes of Kieswetter and Bell have not been able to cement their presence despite getting off to good starts. The English skipper too has failed to capitalize on starts, apart from his match-winning 80 not-out in the second game.England's bowling was top notch during the Test series but has not been able to match up to that level in the limited overs games. Having said that, the bowlers have been pretty consistent with their lines and lengths and if they have unimpressive figures in a few games it has been more due to the Indians batting well. Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann and James Anderson have been England's main wicket-takers, while Steven Finn was also impressive with his pace and line during the fourth game despite not picking up wickets. With a pretty well-balanced attack, England would be counting on the bowlers to inflict damage on the Indians while hoping for the batsmen to settle down.Weather: Rain has thwarted India's hopes of winning a game many a time in this series. It seems the weather gods might not relent at all as the forecast once again is for light rain for most part of the afternoon and some towards the evening. This could lead to a curtailed game once again, and MS Dhoni will be hoping that he can win the toss at least once and put England in to bat.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Ben Stokes, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Steven Finn, Jade Dernbach, Jos Buttler, Alex Hales, Samit PatelIndia (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Ajinkya Rahane, Parthiv Patel, Rahul Dravid, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, RP Singh, Munaf Patel, Amit Mishra, Subramaniam Badrinath, Vinay Kumar, Varun Aaron, Manoj TiwaryLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
