Petersen is on strike. Malinga will open the attackThe players are out in the middle.. We are set for the start of the 3rd ODI.Lots of changes for both teams. Amla has not yet recovered from his knee injury and has been replaced by Quinton de Kock. Lonwabo Tsotsobe and Farhaan Behardien are in as well. Skipper, Angelo is back for the hosts and Ajantha Mendis is in as well. The other Angelo, Perera is making his ODI debut.Pitch Report:  'There was a lot of rain in the morning and the pitch looks bone dry. There are a few cracks on the surface, but they will not play any role. It is an even paced wicket and should be good for batting.'Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Angelo Perera, Thisara Perera, Rangana Herath, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith MalingaSouth Africa (Playing XI): Alviro Petersen, Quinton de Kock, Jean-Paul Duminy, AB de Villiers(w/c), Faf du Plessis, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Robin Peterson, Ryan McLaren, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo TsotsobeSouth Africa have won the toss and elected to batHello and welcome to the 3rd ODI between Sri Lanka and South Africa at Pallekele. Will a change in venue bring about a change in fortunes for the struggling visitors? They are 0-2 down, and need to win at all costs to stay alive in the 5-match series. A win for Sri Lanka will give them an unassailable 3-0 lead. There were showers in the morning so this could be another rain affected game. Stay tuned for toss and team updates...Sri Lanka Angelo Mathews will return to lead the hosts, who are already 2-0 up in the series. Dinesh Chandimal, the replacement captain, did a good job in the first two games, bagging the Man of the Match award in the last match. Mathews' return would mean an added edge to the bowling as the action moves to Pallekele. The pitch at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium is known to assist fast bowlers and with the likes of Malinga, Perera and Mathews in the XI, the hosts will no doubt prove to be a dangerous unit.The batting looks settled too, with Dilshan, Tharanga, Jayawardene and Sangakkara capable of raising the bar beyond South Africa's gasp. Sangakkara set the tone for the series with a sparkling 169 in the first game and he would continue to be the most prized wicket for the Proteas.South Africa While Mathews comes back to add more firepower to Sri Lanka, South Africa will probably have to do without Hashim Amla, the opener for the rest of the tour. Already without Dale Steyn, the bowling has looked ordinary and Amla's absence from the batting line-up would mean a fragile side, at least on paper. There is little doubt that skipper AB de Villiers can lead a revival all on his own, with a good support act around him - the likes of Miller and du Plessis can play that dangerous one-day innings needed in sub-continental conditions. The bowling would again revolve around Morne Morkel but a lot would be expected from Chris Morris and Ryan McLaren with helpful conditions at Pallekele. Whatever the conditions, it would need great resolve and strength from the Proteas to get one past a confident Sri Lankan side, who will be bolstered by the return of their captain, one of the better all-rounders in world cricket.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Angelo Mathews(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Shaminda Eranga, Rangana Herath, Mahela Jayawardene, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Jehan Mubarak, Angelo Perera, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Upul Tharanga, Lahiru ThirimanneSouth Africa (From): AB de Villiers(w/c), Hashim Amla, Farhaan Behardien, Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, Rory Kleinveldt, Ryan McLaren, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Alviro Petersen, Robin Peterson, Aaron Phangiso, Lonwabo TsotsobeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
