Waqar Younis and Afridi were called in to discuss about it. We'll keep you posted on this issue as and when we get some information.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Kamran Akmal(w), Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Mohammad Yousuf, Fawad Alam, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib AkhtarEngland (Playing XI): Andrew Strauss(c), Steve Davies(w), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan, Michael Yardy, Luke Wright, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, James AndersonPakistan have won the toss and elected to batControversies aside, we witnessed a humdinger of a game a couple of days ago when Pakistan fast bowler Umar Gul sent the English batsmen packing. With England leading the series 2-1, they will be getting their second chance to wrap up the series before the 5th and the final ODI on Wednesday. Hello and welcome one and all, we are here to bring you ball by ball action of this 4th ODI from Lord's. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates...by Vishaal LoganathanPakistan and England will return to Lord's for the first time after the tainted 4th test in the recently concluded Test series. Pakistan just about managed to break the shackles the spot fixing controversy seem to have put them in with a great win against England, but the game was once again plunged into controversy with reports of the 3rd ODI being fixed. Before the last match, Pakistan seemed down in the dumps and few could have imagined them defeating the in-form England team. But an inspired bowling spell from Umar Gul clinched a much delayed and much needed victory for Pakistan. Pakistan managed to finally put in a team effort and seal a morale boosting victory. Most of their batsmen chipped in with useful runs before Gul produced his career best figures to get them through. Fawad Alam was their best batsman in the last match, his 64 when the team was in a spot of bother was well paced and showed that the youngster has a good head on his shoulders. He got together well with Asad Shafiz and consolidated the innings well. Shahid Afridi and Abdul Razzaq, Pakistan's biggest hitters, too seemed to be getting back to form. Mohammad Yousuf is yet to show why he is regarded as one of the best Pakistani batsman and will look to show his value to the team with a good performance with the bat. The embattled team are most likely to stick to the same winning squad, as they would not want to experiment much especially during these troubled times. Umar Gul and Shoiab Akthar have been good so far with the ball and will look to continue the good work. Ian Bell has been called up for the 4th ODI and he will look to put a valuable performance to cement his place and also stake a claim for a place in the Ashes squad. Bell has been sensational for Warwickshire since he recovered from the metatarsal injury. Bopara's move to the middle order was a flop as he could make no real impact on the game. Luke Wright played well for his 48 and the return of Paul Collingwood should boost their middle order. James Anderson as usual was superb with the ball and England will hope for him to maintain his rich vein of form. Both teams will have everything to play for in this match. A victory for England will see them get their hands on the ODI series trophy in addition to the test and the T20 trophies, whereas a win for Pakistan will get them to draw level with England at 2-2 and also will expect to maintain momentum gained from the wins. With the ghost of the match fixing controversy looming large, Pakistan will want a performance that will make their fans and players forget about the scandal. England themselves will be looking to get back to winning ways after the unexpected loss.Teams:England (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Steve Davies(w), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan, Michael Yardy, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Luke Wright, Ravi Bopara, Ryan Sidebottom, Ajmal ShahzadPakistan (From): Kamran Akmal(w), Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Mohammad Yousuf, Fawad Alam, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Azhar Ali, Shahzaib Hasan, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad IrfanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
