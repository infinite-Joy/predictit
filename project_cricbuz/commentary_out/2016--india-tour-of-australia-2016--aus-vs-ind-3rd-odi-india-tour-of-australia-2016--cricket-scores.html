AUSTRALIA:48.5 48.5U Yadav to Faulkner, 1 run, Finisher Faulkner attempts a quick single after tapping this length ball to point and Rohit Sharma misses a direct-hit at the bowler's end. Australia win by 3 wickets and with it take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series. As he completes the run, Faulkner goes "woo, hoo" and then jumps and pumps his fist. Dhoni looks disappointed as he walks back to the dressing room. It's another case of so near yet so far for the Indians. Credit to Australia for constructing their chase very well. In fact, this victory is also the highest successful run-chase in ODIs at the MCG. Australia's have made it a hat-trick of record run-chasesJohn Hastings, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:48.4 U Yadav to Maxwell, out Caught by Dhawan!! In the airrrrr, oh he's mistimed it and Maxwell is out for 96. Brilliant innings from Maxi. Look at the applause he gets from the crowd.

Maxwell c Dhawan b U Yadav 96(83) [4s-8 6s-3]U Yadav to Maxwell, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:48.3 U Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR, that's cleared the infield and it's gone for four! Maxwell is just one hit away from his hundred. Australia need 1 run to win. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Maxwell backs away and slices it over backward point for four. 96 now
AUSTRALIA:48.2 U Yadav to Maxwell, SIX, oh yes! Yes, yes yes! He wants a hundred. MCG is always a special place to get a hundred. That's a freebie from Umesh. But one understands that he was trying to bowl the yorker, offers a juicy full ball and Maxwell lofts it easily over long-on
AUSTRALIA:48.1 U Yadav to Maxwell, no run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Maxwell backs away and tries to slog, toe-ends it on the bounce to mid-off. Is he aiming a hundred here? That was a big shotUmesh Yadav [9.0-0-57-1] is back into the attackJadeja ends 10-0-49-2. He's bowled very well today.

AUSTRALIA:46.6 Ishant to Faulkner, 2 runs, gee! These inside-edges and mistimed hits along the ground are so handy in big grounds like these. Aren't they? Faulkner steps out and inside-edges the slog towards mid-wicket, the fielder in the deep had a lot of ground to cover and the batsmen had enough time to get back for the second
AUSTRALIA:46.5 Ishant to Faulkner, no run, another "wait on" from Faulkner as he cuts this short of length delivery straight to Rohit Sharma at backward point. Oops! Ishant tumbled onto the ground after delivering that ball

AUSTRALIA:46.1 Ishant to Maxwell, FOUR, "Ishant, you can't bowl there," says a disappointed VVS Laxman on air. Poor ball from the senior bowler. He tried the slower ball and bowled on the leg stump, Maxwell moves inside the line a bit and cleverly tickles it fine to the fine leg boundary.

Fullish and on the leg stump, Maxwell flicks it straight to square leg and sets off, Faulkner sends his partner back, Maxwell was halfway down the pitch, Umesh had one stump to aim at and he opted not to throw because there was no one backing up the throw. So what? Got to back yourself to fire a direct-hit. Is that the opportunity India needed? Time will tell. Must say that the man at backward point should have been alert and must have been there to back up the throw
AUSTRALIA:44.3 Ishant to Maxwell, no run, oh beaten! The leg-cutter from Ishant, Maxwell backs away and cuts, but doesn't make contact

AUSTRALIA:42.6 U Yadav to Maxwell, no ball, FOUR, oh the ball has slipped out of Umesh Yadav's hands and it's a no ball for height as well. Full toss above waist height, Maxwell easily lofts it over extra-cover and it almost goes all the way
AUSTRALIA:42.5 U Yadav to Maxwell, 2 runs, very full and on the leg stump, driven wide of long-on, the throw comes towards the striker's end, Jadeja it was, he quickly released the ball but it was very wide. A better throw would have caught Maxwell short
AUSTRALIA:42.4 U Yadav to Maxwell, SIX, that's muscled! As long as Maxwell is out there Australia will feel that they have got this in the bag. Length delivery on the leg stump, Maxwell backs away and lofts it over mid-off and clears the rope by some distance

Short of a length delivery tailing back in very late, beat Faulkner all ends up as he tries to defend, the ball beat the inside edge and almost shaved the off stump as wellSo Australia have seen off one of Jadeja's overs. And they have taken 5 runs off it. Not bad and they would just want to play him out.
AUSTRALIA:41.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Faulkner, 1 run, quicker ball on the stumps, Faulkner just about brings his bat down in time to punch it to long-on

In this modern era, even 64 off 24 is possible, but its all about handling pressure and this is MCG, not one of those small cricket grounds.
AUSTRALIA:40.6 U Yadav to Maxwell, no run, stunning over from Umesh Yadav, who was spraying the ball around early on. This is how you bowl at international level and credit to him for bouncing back strongly in the same game. Short of a length delivery swinging back in, Maxwell tries to pull after getting across the sticks, but misses and gets hit on the thigh pad. Probably it kept a bit low as well
AUSTRALIA:40.5 U Yadav to Maxwell, no run, the cheer gets bigger and bigger. Good length delivery on the off stump, Maxwell defends it back to the bowler

AUSTRALIA:39.4 Barinder to Maxwell, SIX, oh wow! Just wow! Maxwell hit one similar to this during the 2015 World Cup and now he's played a slap despite being cramped for room and it has cleared the square boundary on the off-side. That's a big boundary too. He's literally sliced this all the way for six. Fifty under pressure. What a knock. Could well be a match-winning one for the Aussies
AUSTRALIA:39.4 Barinder to Maxwell, wide, oh that's harsh on the bowler, he bowled a well disguised slower ball just past the leg stump. Dhoni liked it as Maxwell didn't pick it. Wasn't too far away from the leg stump
AUSTRALIA:39.3 Barinder to Maxwell, no run, shout from Dhoni, but umpire Richard Kettleborough shakes his head. Short delivery outside off stump, Maxwell looks to cut hard, but misses. There was a sound as the ball passed the bat. Oh well, the Ultra-Edge shows a spike, but it seems like it has come after the ball has passed the bat. Not sure!
AUSTRALIA:39.2 Barinder to Maxwell, 2 runs, slower delivery on the stumps, Maxwell tucks this into the vacant mid-wicket region and before the throw came from the incoming deep mid-wicket fielder, they completed two
AUSTRALIA:39.1 Barinder to Maxwell, FOUR, now that is why he wanted the strike back. The Australian flags are waving in the stands. Short and outside off stump, Maxwell backs away and Barinder serves him nicely and sweetly with a short ball, which is slapped over cover for a boundary. Great start to the over for the Aussies
AUSTRALIA:38.6 Ishant to Maxwell, 1 run, Maxwell keeps calm and softly tucks this to mid-wicket. Well, why won't he do that? After all this is the last ball of the over and he can keep strike for the next over
AUSTRALIA:38.5 Ishant to Maxwell, no run, another inside edge this time from Maxwell and it rolls into the off-side off the pad. Maxwell tries to defend, but the late inswing beat him there
AUSTRALIA:38.4 Ishant to Faulkner, 1 run, oh he almost lost his sticks there. Is that nerves from Faulkner? Mind you, he's called Finisher Faulkner. But that was very tentative from the all-rounder. Short of a length delivery tailing back in, Faulkner literally pokes at it as he tries to defend, gets an inside edge that just misses the stumps, Dhoni dives to his left and stops the ball
AUSTRALIA:38.3 Ishant to Faulkner, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Faulkner defends off the back footAlright, it's Faulkner v Ishant again. Remember Mohali 2013 anyone?
AUSTRALIA:38.2 Ishant to Maxwell, 1 run, short of length delivery just outside off stump, Maxwell plays very late and guides it to third manJames Faulkner, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:38.1 Ishant to Wade, out Caught by Dhawan!! In the air, straight up in the air, a big cheer already from the crowd even before the catch is taken and Shikhar Dhawan doesn't disappoint them. Shortish delivery on the off stump, Wade goes for the pull, only gets a top-edge, mid-on runs forward, settles under it nicely and swallows it. Well, Dhawan even had time to finish his buffet there. That was in the air for so long. Wade c Dhawan b Ishant 6(10)Ishant to Wade, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:37.6 Barinder to Wade, 1 run, Wade is early into the pull and he toe-ends this to mid-on
AUSTRALIA:37.5 Barinder to Maxwell, 1 run, short delivery on the stumps, Maxwell pulls it to deep square leg
AUSTRALIA:37.4 Barinder to Wade, 1 run, Dhoni is good with his football and he almost effected a run-out here. Short of a length delivery just outside off stump, Wade defends with soft hands, so much so that it almost rolled back onto the off stump, Maxwell wanted a quick single, Wade responds, Dhoni runs forward and kicks the ball with his right leg and almost hits the stumps. A direct-hit would have been very interesting
AUSTRALIA:37.3 Barinder to Maxwell, 1 run, ha ha! Ishant Sharma gets an ironic cheer from the crowd for stopping the ball at third man. Remember, he fumbled a simple stop a few minutes ago. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Maxwell outside edges the punch and picks up a run. Ishant sees the funny side of it as well. Waves to the crowd with a smile on his face
AUSTRALIA:37.2 Barinder to Maxwell, no run, oh hang on! Maxwell has been sensible so far and now he plays an audacious shot! I think that is why he changed his bat. Short delivery from Barinder, Maxwell goes for the pull and misses
AUSTRALIA:37.1 Barinder to Wade, 1 run, "Yes, mate," says Wade after tucking this short of length delivery behind square on the on-side, not from the middle of the bat though
AUSTRALIA:36.6 Ishant to Maxwell, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Maxwell defends it into the on-sidePause in play as Maxwell wants a change of bat and gloves. Is he going to change gears? The helmet is on, the gloves are on and he's ready to battle again.

AUSTRALIA:36.4 Ishant to Wade, 1 run, full and outside off stump, Wade drives along the ground to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:36.3 Ishant to Maxwell, 1 run, a rocket throw from Jaddu, but Maxi is quick enough. Another sensible single from Maxwell.

AUSTRALIA:36.2 Ishant to Wade, 1 run, shortish delivery on the stumps, Wade pulls over mid-wicketThe great thing for Australia is that Maxwell is not panicking out there. He's very calm and not going hard at everything.

AUSTRALIA:35.1 Barinder to Maxwell, out Mitchell Marsh Run Out!! 2 runs completed. My word! Gee, this guy, MS Dhoni, can not only captain, keep wickets and bat, he can also act. He's pretended as if the ball is not coming towards his end and that fooled Mitch Marsh. So clever! Brilliant. Add whatever you want. Full and outside off stump, Maxwell drives wide of mid-off, he wants the third run and Marsh responds well. Dhoni ran up to the stumps and was in a great position. He was standstill for a moment, which gave Marsh the impression that the throw was going to Maxwell's end, but all of a sudden, Dhoni quickly collects the ball and breaks the sticks. Must say that it was a rocket throw from Umesh Yadav, who gave chase and put in the slide to stop the ball. He has a great arm and the throw was right next to the stumps, which was key to this dismissal. Oh look at the determination in Kohli's eyes. He roars and pumps his fist. He's desperate to win this. It's 204/5 and the pressure is back on Australia. Mitchell Marsh run out (U Yadav/Dhoni) 17(14) [4s-3]Barinder to Maxwell, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!Top over that from Umesh, after a poor over. Vindicated the captain's call to continue with him.
AUSTRALIA:34.6 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, oh that's a great finish to the over, just 1 run off it. Oh dear! What have you done Ishant Sharma? It should have been a dot ball, but Australia have two more runs. Look at the anger in Kohli's eyes. He's furious and that is simply unacceptable from Ishant, a senior member of the team. Good length delivery on the stumps, Marsh defends it to mid-on, Ishant fumbles and allows two
AUSTRALIA:34.5 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, no run, appeal for LBW again, now this is turning out to be a top over from Umesh. Fullish and swinging back in, Marsh looks to push off the front foot, impact on leg stump, but the late swing was taking it down the leg-side
AUSTRALIA:34.4 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Marsh pushes it to cover
AUSTRALIA:34.3 U Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run, optimistic shout for LBW, clearly hit outside the line of off stump. Length delivery angled in, Maxwell was late on the dab, the ball hits the pad before running to third man off the bat. Animated appeal from Kohli as well, but the umpire was spot on
AUSTRALIA:34.2 U Yadav to Maxwell, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Maxwell defends off the back foot
AUSTRALIA:34.1 U Yadav to Maxwell, no run, full and outside off stump, Maxwell drove hard, but hit it straight to mid-offUmesh again? Won't Rishi Dhawan be a decent option at this stage? He bowls decent slower balls and there is every chance that the batsman could mistime one as they are looking to attack. Remember, the square boundaries are big here at the MCG.
AUSTRALIA:33.6 Barinder to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, short and wide outside off stump, cut hard to sweeper cover, Rohit is the fielder there and they take an extra run for the throw. Good running

AUSTRALIA:33.1 Barinder to Maxwell, no run, short of length delivery from Barinder, Maxwell defendsBarinder Sran [4.0-0-36-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:32.6 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, and again. "Nooo, no, no, no," says Mark Nicholas on air! This is another dreadful ball. It is very important to close out the over very well, not just start well. Short of a length delivery on the pads and Marsh tickles it on its way for four
AUSTRALIA:32.5 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, just 1 run off the first 4 balls and instead of maintaining the pressure, Umesh bowls a filthy short ball down the leg-side and gifts four runs. Tells you about the maturity of the bowler. Well, he'll argue that he tried to bounce the batsman out, but it didn't rise much and Marsh helped it on its way to the fine leg boundary
AUSTRALIA:32.4 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, no run, short of length delivery just outside off stump, Marsh tries to pull, under-edges it to mid-on, Maxwell wanted a run as he desperately wanted the strike, but there was never a run there

AUSTRALIA:31.5 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, leg byes, 1 run, inside-edge onto pad I guess, the ball rolls towards gully, oh they attempt a sharp single, Jadeja quickly picks up the ball running from backward point and has a shy at the bowler's end, for a moment Jaddu thought it was a direct-hit and almost started appealing. Okay, no edge on that according to the umpire, off the thigh pad
AUSTRALIA:31.4 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, Marsh defends to point, Jadeja has a needless shy at the bowler's end, Maxwell went nowhere. Thankfully there was someone backing up the throw
AUSTRALIA:31.3 Ishant to Maxwell, 1 run, oh a false shot from Maxi. He should have been forward to this good length delivery, instead he opts to play off the back foot and gets into an awkward position, steers it to third man with one hand in the end
AUSTRALIA:31.2 Ishant to Maxwell, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, Maxwell pushes it towards mid-off
AUSTRALIA:31.1 Ishant to Maxwell, FOUR, that's a clever hit! He shows that he's not about muscling and slogging! Short delivery on the stumps, rose nicely, so much so that Maxwell hardly had to move, just waited to the ball to come and ramped it over Dhoni's head for a boundary
AUSTRALIA:30.6 Barinder to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, it's a 11-run over after the wicket-taking over and surely a lot of pressure has been released. Good hit from Mitch Marsh. Barinder overpitches again in an attempt to give the ball a bit more of air-time as he looks for swing, but it goes as a juicy full ball and it's on-driven nicely past the diving mid-on fielder
AUSTRALIA:30.5 Barinder to Maxwell, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Maxwell guides it to third man
AUSTRALIA:30.4 Barinder to Maxwell, FOUR, now nothing is going to stop Maxi from playing his shots! That's the way he bats and that's exactly what Australia need at the moment - counterpunch! Excellent hit. Full and in the slot, Maxwell lofts it handsomely over mid-on and poses for the camera. One bounce and into the fence
AUSTRALIA:30.3 Barinder to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, not convincing from the younger Marsh. Full delivery outside off stump, Marsh drives uppishly through cover-point, could have so easily gone to hand that
AUSTRALIA:30.2 Barinder to Mitchell Marsh, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Marsh defends off the back foot
AUSTRALIA:30.1 Barinder to Maxwell, 1 run, good length delivery outside off stump, just a hint of outswing on it probably, Maxwell pushes it square of the wicket on the off-sideBarinder Sran [3.0-0-25-0] is back into the attackMitchell Marsh, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:29.6 Ishant to S Marsh, out Caught by Dhoni!! Edged and taken! There you go! That's where you need to bowl, Ishant Sharma. And not experiment too much. Stick to the corridor of uncertainty rather than spraying the ball around. Massive wicket this for the Indians. Marsh was looking solid for a big hundred. The Indian fans in the stands are elated and so is Ishant, who pumps his fist in joy. Good length delivery angled across, nothing great about the ball, but that is the beauty of bowling a tight line around the off stump line. An unforced error from Marsh, who tried to run it down to third man without moving his feet and got an outside edge. He made 70 odd at the Gabba, today he's made 62. Look at what this wicket means to the Indians. Dhoni throws the ball as high as he can and Kohli runs towards Ishant with his hands aloft like a flying bird. S Marsh c Dhoni b Ishant 62(73) [4s-6]Ishant to S Marsh, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:29.5 Ishant to Maxwell, 1 run, now Ishant bowls short and wide outside off stump, Maxwell cuts it softly through point

AUSTRALIA:29.1 Ishant to Maxwell, 1 run, good length delivery on the leg stump, Maxwell works it away behind square on the on-sideThis is getting interesting. Maxwell is keen to counter-attack. How will the Indian bowlers react? Australia need 134 runs in 126 balls.
AUSTRALIA:28.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run, shuffled across and opened the bat-face to dab it square of the wicket on the off-side
AUSTRALIA:28.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Maxwell, no run, quick ball, Maxwell stayed back to defend it

AUSTRALIA:26.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run, extra zip on that. Jadeja may have given it more rip. Maxwell is hit high on the bat as he pushes at it. Good enough for a single to long-off
AUSTRALIA:26.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Maxwell, no run, stays back and defends the ball back to the bowler

AUSTRALIA:26.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Maxwell, no run, another ripping effort from Dhoni. Fired in from Jadeja, batsman ended up playing inside the line as the ball spun. Maxwell missed the shot and Dhoni took the bails off. Batsman had his back leg dragged in and is safe. Third umpire thinks the same

AUSTRALIA:26.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Bailey, out Stumped!! A review for stumping has gone upstairs. India are celebrating already! Fair delivery. Never is unfair with Jadeja. And he is gone.

Quicker than an eye wink. Bailey's back foot was just outside the crease. He tried to his best to plant it back into the crease, but Dhoni was too good for him.

AUSTRALIA:17.5 Gurkeerat Singh to S Marsh, 3 runs, oh lovely use of the crease. Goes deep inside, and back-cuts it out of Dhoni's gloves. Hits it fine enough to beat short third man. However, again the length of the boundaries allows the fielder to chase it down

S Marsh is on strike. U Yadav will open the attackWelcome back.. The series is on the line. For a change, this isn't a belter. Can India's bowlers redeem themselves? Umesh has the new ball, a change of strategy from IndiaHere's the man of the moment, Virat Kohli giving his insight on the wicket and the partnership with Rahane, "I love batting with him (referring to his partnership with Rahane). We have had some good partnerships in the recent past, he is technically very right and very intent when running between the wickets. He (Dhoni) was charged up today. He wanted to smack a few and right from the first ball which he smacked for boundary. The guys are pretty excited for the challenge we have in front of us to make the series 2-1. The wicket is a bit on the slower side. The guys have to be smart enough to change their pace and should have learned from the previous two games."Kohli, who had a 90+ and a 50+ in the series already, was in the mood today. He was not missing out on an opportunity for the third time, mixed caution with aggression and racked up his first ton against Australia in Australia. In the process, he went past 7000 ODI runs as well - overtook AB de Villiers to become the fastest to get to the milestone. Rahane played second fiddle to Kohli and the pair added 109 for the third wicket. Both perished while trying to accelerate and the onus was on Dhoni. And the skipper delivered with a quickfire 23 to take the team close to 300. At the toss, Smith said that the pitch will get better for batting under lights. Will that be the case? Join us back in 40 minutes to find out...Deja vu! As has been the case at the WACA and the Gabba, one batsman scores a ton, couple of them make decent contributions and the team ends with a massive score. But will it be enough? That remains to be seen. Today was not Rohit Sharma's day as he departed early. Shikhar Dhawan came into the game with a lot of pressure which was there for everyone to see as he took his time to get going, but made sure he stays in the reckoning with a patient fifty.4
INDIA:49.6 Faulkner to R Dhawan, no run, another swing and a miss and just 6 runs off the final over. And that too with an extra ball. Slower delivery outside off stump, Dhawan advance and tries to muscle the ball, only connects with thin air
INDIA:49.5 Faulkner to R Dhawan, no run, again the back and across movement from Dhawan, the slower ball again from Faulkner, Dhawan tries to slog hard but makes no contact. Inexperience showing there! Can someone tell Dhawan that the straight boundary is shorter than the mid-wicket boundary?

INDIA:48.5 Hastings to Dhoni, out Caught by Maxwell!! Dhoni tries to go big again, but holes out this time. Excellent bowling from Hastings and he picks up his 4th wicket. He saw Dhoni racing down the track and banged the slower ball short, the ball went off the toe-end of the bat, Maxwell moved forward from deep mid-wicket and completed the catch. Looks like Maxwell has hurt his finger while taking the catch. Dhoni c Maxwell b Hastings 23(9) [4s-2 6s-2]Hastings to Dhoni, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

INDIA:47.4 Faulkner to Gurkeerat Singh, out Bowled!! Before the game, Faulkner spoke about the slower ball being effective on this surface and he's got a wicket with it now. Gurkeerat tries to slog hard, didn't read the change of pace from the left-arm bowler and the inside-edge crashed into the leg stump. Gurkeerat Singh b Faulkner 8(7) [4s-1]Faulkner to Gurkeerat Singh, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:47.3 Faulkner to Gurkeerat Singh, FOUR, first boundary in international cricket for Gurkeerat Singh. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, Gurkeerat pulls fiercely through backward square leg and it races away for four
INDIA:47.2 Faulkner to Dhoni, 1 run, length delivery just outside off stump, Dhoni goes for the slog and hits it on the bounce to long-on, a lofted drive would have been a better option there

INDIA:46.2 Hastings to Kohli, out Caught by Bailey!! In the air and straight to Bailey again. That ends a fine knock from India's No. 3. Clever piece of bowling from Hastings. He knows that the wicket is slow and bangs the slower ball short, Kohli had to manufacture a lot of pace in an attempt to hit a boundary, he went for the lofted drive and did not control it. Picked out Bailey to perfection. The Aussies will be very happy with the blow as Kohli was looking dangerous. The replays show that Kohli actually had to reach out to play that shot as he went leg-side while coming down the track. Kohli c Bailey b Hastings 117(117) [4s-7 6s-2]Hastings to Kohli, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:46.1 Hastings to Kohli, no run, oh will feel that he's missed out here! Full toss outside off stump, Kohli drives sweetly from the middle of the bat, but hits it straight to the man at cover. A couple of yards either side of the fielder would have been four

INDIA:45.4 Faulkner to Dhoni, wide, another wide from Faulkner as he tries the widish yorker, Dhoni was just ball-watching on that occasion
INDIA:45.3 Faulkner to Dhoni, SIX, the MCG is big, but not big enough for the Indian skipper. He's another player who has a strong bottom hand grip. Faulkner bowls a juicy full ball and it was right in the slot as well, Dhoni slogs and hits it flat over deep mid-wicket

INDIA:44.5 Hastings to Kohli, FOUR, oh a fumble from Maxwell and it's a four.

INDIA:44.2 Hastings to Rahane, out Caught by Maxwell!! In the air, not timed well and that's a great catch in the deep. I know it will go down as caught Maxwell, but it was Smith, who did all the hard work there. Hastings bangs the slower ball short, Rahane steps out and tries to play the big hit, mistimes it completely and it goes off the toe-end of the bat, long-on runs to his right, takes the catch, but as he was close to the rope, threw it towards the approaching Maxwell, who came from deep mid-wicket and that was so easily done by the duo. Credit to Maxwell as well for ensuring that he was close to Smith and ready for the relay. Hastings runs towards the skipper and shakes hands first, before celebrating with Maxwell. Meanwhile, there is a big cheer from the crowd as they see Dhoni stride out. End of a handy innings from Rahane. Rahane c Maxwell b Hastings 50(55) [4s-4 6s-1]Hastings to Rahane, THAT'S OUT!!

Short of a length delivery on the off stump, Kohli works it behind square on the on-side. As he takes the run, he jumps and pumps his fist in joy. Takes the helmet off and then raises his bat to a great applause from the crowd and the dressing room. Takes a moment as he gets a bit emotional pointing the bat towards the sky. Rahane walks towards him and gives a hug. Kohli missed out at the WACA and Gabba, but not today! This guy loves the big stage. Doesn't he?
INDIA:42.3 Kane Richardson to Kohli, FOUR, only Virat Kohli, only Virat Kohli can do it! Gee, what wrists he has! Such a strong bottom hand grip. Surely, I'll tell that it wasn't a bad ball at all.

The pitch might be a contributing factor though. Not as even paced as the previous two ones. Some deliveries are stopping and not quite coming on.

INDIA:15.1 Faulkner to Dhawan, 1 run, gives the charge even as the bowler was in his delivery stride. Faulkner might have seen him come and pulled his length back slightly.

Kane Richardson will open the attackRight, the players are out in the field. We are all set to go..Okay, let's get back to white-ball cricket. Smith spoke about starting well with the ball. They did start well in the first two ODIs as Dhawan only managed single-digit scores. He is under a lot of pressure. Well, as said earlier, the last time he walked out to bat at the MCG, he scored a hundred. Probably he can take confidence from that. Australia's worry would be that they have not been able to make inroads in the middle overs. India have their problem of not exactly knowing when is the right time to accelerate after a period of consolidation. A lot of things to look forward to on this exciting Sunday.So two debutants for India. Gurkeerat and Rishi Dhawan become the 208th and 209th players respectively to represent India in the ODI format. By the way, here's some great news to all the Indian fans. After South Africa's crushing loss yesterday in Johannesburg, India have regained the No. 1 spot in the Test rankings.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Ravindra Jadeja, Rishi Dhawan, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Barinder SranAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, John Hastings, Scott Boland, Kane RichardsonDhoni: "We were anyway going to bat first. Looking at the conditions and how the Australians have batted, we have made two changes. Gurkeerat and Rishi Dhawan will be making their debuts and they replace Manish Pandey and Ashwin. Rishi is a bit of an all-rounder. He can bowl seam-up and do a bit of lower-order batting. Gurkeerat is a batsman who can bowl a bit of off-spin. It also gives me that extra part-timer, which makes the bowling look slightly better. We need to capitalise more in the second half of the batting. With the ball, we need to do better and not give too many boundary balls."Smith: "We will bowl. We have been chasing quite well and the wicket here looks quite dry and I think it will get better under the lights. Hopefully, we'll do well with the ball today. We have been batting very well. He (Rohit) is batting extremely well. Mitchell Marsh is back for Joel Paris."Australia have won the toss and have opted to fieldToss time folks!Meanwhile, we are hearing that Rishi Dhawan has been handed his ODI cap. So who does he replace? After the last game, Dhoni spoke about Ashwin making for the all-rounder. What will be India's line-up for this do-or-die contest? Remember, Australia already have a 2-0 lead. Will the hosts make any changes to their XI? Anyway, we'll get the official confirmation at the toss in just a few minutes.Pitch Report: 'It looks a bit different from Gabba and WACA, there will be some low bounce, but there's plenty of runs on offer. This wicket might assist the Indian bowlers a bit. The team winning the toss should bat first, there will be some swing on offer under lights and the ball might grip as well,' reckons Wasim Akram."Either, we put pressure on the batsmen and score 330 or ask them (Australia) to bat first. These are the two options that we have got," said Dhoni after India's loss at the Gabba. The skipper is spot on. A lot has been spoken about India's problems with the ball during the death overs, but nowadays seems to be a problem developing with the bat as well. And, strangely, India haven't quite been able to press hard during the middle overs either. On the other hand, Australia know exactly how to do it. In the last game, even when Marsh and Finch weren't all that fluent in their opening partnership, they backed themselves and really turned it on after the drinks break and that put a lot of pressure on the Indian bowlers. So how are Dhoni's boys going to approach the batting today? We'll wait and watch.Now onto MS Dhoni's boys. Rohit Sharma. Well, on a lighter note, two hundreds in two games after marriage - that's a great start. Isn't it? Dhoni and the whole of India would be blessing him, "may he continue to shine." Virat Kohli scored fifties in both the matches and is looking good for more. Ajinkya Rahane impressed everyone with the only chance he got - in the second ODI. Hang on, we missed someone in the top 4. Ah! Shikhar Dhawan it is. The opener's form is a big concern for the visitors as he managed just single figures in both the games. Here's a stat that would delight all you Dhawan fans or even the 30-year-old himself. The last time he played at the MCG, he made a fine hundred and that too in the World Cup and that too against the mighty South Africa.We hardly have anything to talk about the bowlers so far. Two flat tracks and the batsmen made merry. Will the equation change today? As an avid cricket fan, I sincerely hope that it does. We all would want to watch an even battle between bat and ball. Won't we? Let's talk about the batsmen from both sides now. The hosts first. Australia - Aaron Finch failed in the first game, but made runs at the Gabba. Shaun Marsh, replacing David Warner (paternity leave) made the most of the opportunity and registered a fifty. Steven Smith can do nothing wrong against India. Now if you thought Smith loves batting against the Men in Blue, take a look at this. 9 innings, 671 runs, 2 hundreds, 4 fifties and all this at an average of 95.85. This is George Bailey's record against India in ODIs. Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade, James Faulkner are all there but there is not much to write about them as we haven't seen enough of them so far in the series.Two of Rohit Sharma's hundreds have gone in vain for India. On the other hand, Australia registered two record-breaking victories at the WACA and Gabba respectively. Today we are at the picturesque "G". What is in store for us? Welcome to the third of the five-match ODI series. It's a chillaxing Sunday and we have two power-packed line-ups on show to entertain us. 1236 runs have been scored so far in the series and just 19 wickets fell against 40. So that tells you that it's been a bat-dominant series so far. Will we see 300 on the board once again? Remember, the boundaries here at the MCG are big, but nothing is impossible nowadays with the bat. Isn't it?Preview by Vishaal LoganathanTwo games. 1230-plus runs. 19 wickets!The ongoing series between Australia and India has been far from what one would expect of a series Down Under. Bowlers, Indian or Australian, hardly getting a sniff. Batsmen running amok at will, and record chases being broken like it was just a walk in the park.Melbourne Cricket Ground, the venue of the third ODI, could hopefully change all that. "I think in general, it's a tough gig bowling at Perth and Brisbane. Runs can be scored so fast due to the pace on the ball. Change-ups don't really grip as much as the the MCG or Canberra that we will come up against later in the tournament," James Faulkner had said ahead of the Brisbane ODI, and viewers and players will be hoping the upcoming games will provide a more even contest between bat and ball.India are 2-0 down in the series despite having scored 300+ after winning the toss and batting first on bothoccasions, and they will be desperate to ensure thatthe last two ODIs don't turn into dead rubbers. The visitors are left with a lot to ponder after back-to-back defeats - Shikhar Dhawan's failing form, bowling combination and batting during the death showing up foremost on the list.For Australia, their bowling hasn't been at their best, but the young attack has shown tremendous character in fighting back and regaining control during the final few overs. India, on both occasions, looked set to amass over 330, but some impressive bowling has ensured MS Dhoni's side has been restricted to less than 310.Date and Time: January 17, 14:20 Local Time, 08:50 ISTWeather: 33 degrees with a slight chance of rainVenue: Melbourne Cricket GroundTeam News:IndiaIndia are expected to keep faith in the same eleven that played in Brisbane, but there will be questions in their mind whether that is their best XI. Dhawan's struggle at the top has been masked by Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli's fine run in the series.Rohit has back-to-back hundreds in the series, but he will be hoping that they start translating into wins soon. Virat Kohli, twice, threw away opportunities to notch up his 24th ODI hundred, and he will hope to break that jinx soon. He has been in great form in the ODIs with three fifties and a hundred in his last five games, but what will hurt him is the fact that India have only won one of those. Ajinkya Rahane's superb knock at number four reaffirms belief and adds steel into the young middle-order.Dhoni, Manish Pandey and Ravindra Jadeja have failed to hit big during the final few overs, and India will be keen on them making use of a good platform to propel the score towards the 330-plus mark, a total the Indian captain said his team would target.On the bowling front, Dhoni has reiterated that he likes the two-spinner combination the most, and he will, in all likelihood, stick to R Ashwin and Jadeja. The bowling trio of Ishant Sharma, Barinder Sran and Umesh Yadav is expected to keep its place, for now.Probable XI: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni, Manish Pandey, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Barinder Sran, Ishant Sharma.AustraliaAustralia, looking to close out the series in Melbourne, have few things to worry about. Their batting looks settled with everyone in the top four having gotten amongst the runs and the self-belief is sky-high. Like Aaron Finch said after the second ODI, the team has the "confidence that (it) can chase down any total."George Bailey and Steven Smith continue to torment the Indians, while the likes of Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner and Matthew Wade will be itching to get out there and make their presence felt.With Josh Hazlewood being rested for the rest of Australia's home summer, John Hastings has taken the opportunity with both hands. He was one of the more impressive performers with the ball in Brisbane, and he has retained his spot in the side. Joel Paris and Scott Boland have still not had the kind of impact they would have hoped for, while Kane Richardson, who played in Brisbane, was at thereceivedend of Rahane and Rohit's stick.With Mitchell Marsh back in the squad, Richardson could make way for the all-rounder.Probable XI: Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, Steven Smith, George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Matthew Wade, Mitchell Marsh, John Hastings, Scott Boland, Joel Paris.Quotes:So now, as a team we have to win irrespective of which department has not been doing well. So, I think, we'll have to score 20-30 more runs and that will put a lot of pressure on the batsmen, because from the moment you take guard, on the back of your mind, you'll be thinking, we'll have to score 330-340. That will definitely put a lot of pressure: MS DhoniThe white-ball wickets have been fantastic at the MCG this year, throughout the Big Bash. They've actually had a bit more pace in them than usual; so I think it'll be another high-scoring affair. I can't see that changing. If we bowl first, try to contain them to around 300. If we bat first, we try to push on and score 330 or 330 plus: John HastingsTeams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Manish Pandey, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Barinder Sran, Rishi Dhawan, Axar Patel, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Bhuvneshwar KumarAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, John Hastings, Scott Boland, Joel Paris, Usman Khawaja, Kane RichardsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
