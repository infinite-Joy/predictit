We would have liked to bat first but it is a good idea to bowl. I am actually from New Delhi and I will be enjoying the occasion.Kamande: We will have a bat first. We have been following the other games and the wicket here is slow and low. The bowlers will enjoy this wicket. Our batting has been a major problem. Odoyo replaces Ongondo and Shem Ngoche is out and James Ngoche comes in.Pitch Report: There is a nice breeze blowing across the stadium. It is very sunny. This wicket will be low and slow. It is devoid of grass and there are some cracks. There will be some turn on offer. This is a bat first wicket.Hello and Welcome to the match between Kenya and Canada in Delhi. Both of these teams will be looking to register a win in this competition after being thrashed by the big teams. Canada would be pleased by their performance against Pakistan, but they would be disappointed by their poor batting display. Kenya, on the other hand, have been poor in all departments. This promises to be a good battle between these two minnows.The preview by Gokul GopalKenya vs Canada is hardly a game most people would flock to nor will it generate any sort of interest with the match bearing no significant impact in the group outcomes. With both teams languishing at the bottom of Group A without a single point after losing three games each, they have nothing but pride to play for when they meet in the low-key clash.Head to Head:Kenya and Canada have played each other in 12 ODIs with the former emerging victorious on 7 occasions while losing four games to the North American team. One match yeilded no result. In the World Cups, Kenya are undefeated against Canada, having won a match each in 2003 and 2007.Build up to the game:Kenya: The African team's World Cup campaign has been largely unimpressive. In their opening game against New Zealand, they were skittled out for a paltry 69 - the second lowest total in World Cups, just below Bangladesh's 58 all-out a few days back. The Kiwis had no troubles in chasing down the target, taking just 8 overs to get there. Kenya's second outing was against Pakistan and here too, their performance lacked any merit. Pakistan posted a formidable 317 thanks to fifties from the Akmal brothers, Younis Khan and Misbah as well as the generosity of the Kenyans in terms of extras - 49 runs were given away in extras and that included 37 wides and 6 no-balls. When it came to their turn to bat, the minnows could only manage 112 runs before being blown away by an Afridi five-wicket haul. Then came the game against Sri Lanka and the Kenyans once again failed to show up on the big stage. The wrecker-in-chief this time was Lasith Malinga who took 6/38, including a hat-trick, to shoot out Kenya for just 142 and the Lankans chased down the target with relative ease. With three games left, the Kenyans would be hoping put in their best efforts to restore some lost honour and would prefer to sign out with their heads held high.Canada: The Canadians have been slightly better in their showing during the World Cup when compared to the African side, considering their previous game against Pakistan. The North American team were pretty impressive with the ball and gave Pakistan a scare by bowling them out for just 184. For a better part of the Canadian batting, it appeared like they would pull off the impossible similar to what Ireland did against England. But from 104/3 they were reduced to 138 all-out because of Shahid Afridi's second five-wicket haul of the 2011 World Cup. But barring this match, Canada have been below average in the other two matches. Against Sri Lanka, they were batted out of the game when the co-hosts posted a commanding 332/7. In reply, the Ashish Bagai led side could only manage 122 runs at the cost of 10 wickets. Canada were expected to give Zimbabwe a good run for the money during their second game. But they ended up with a disappointing performance, letting Zimbabwe post 298 while bowing out for just 123 when they came out to bat. Like the Kenyans, Canada too would be only hoping to regain some lost pride and go out of the tournament with atleast a win or two under their belt.Ground Conditions and Pitch:Clear skies and sunny afternoon is in store for both teams when they face off at the Feroz Shah Kotla for the third match of the 2011 World Cup at this venue. In the first game, South Africa easily succeeded in chasing down a target of 222 against the West Indies while the latter posted a total of 330 quite comfortably in the match against Netherlands. Once again, a flat track would welcome Kenya and Canada, and the team winning the toss would prefer to bat first, considering the dew factor that might come in to play in the latter part of the match.Captains speak:Our batting let us down, we just played poorly during our chase. It was a good toss to lose as the wicket had become better as the game progressed but Afridi took it away from us. Ireland played pretty bravely against England and that's why losing against Pakistan was more disappointing: Ashish Bagai, disappointed that Canada could not emulate the Irish effort against England.
Our big concern is we are not batting out our 50 overs. That's the one area we want to work on very, very hard because you can't win matches without batting your full quota of overs.Canada have also suffered big defeats and we know they will also come hard at us and that's what we should be prepared for: Jimmy Kamade, unhappy with the showing of the batsmen.
