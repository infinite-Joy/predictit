Must say this is an absolute stunner from Steven Finn. Smith takes a step forward and flicks, for a moment it looked as if he placed it well wide of the fielder at short mid-wicket. The lanky Middlesex lad dives to his right, stretches his right hand out and grabs a screamer. He is mobbed by his teammates and England sense that they have removed the dangerman.

AUSTRALIA:6.1 Finn to Burns, out Caught by Eoin Morgan!! Burns was looking itchy and has thrown his wicket away! Almost a collision between Morgan and Roy - but the England skipper holds on.

Morgan ran in, Roy ran back from short extra cover, there was no calling between the two fielders. They almost tumbled into each other, but by then, Morgan had done well to hold onto the ball - diving forward with both hands. Sheepish smiles on both faces as they celebrate.

Stokes fumbles and takes his own time to turn back towards the ball, the batsmen pinch a quick singleBurns and Finch are at the crease. Burns is on strike. Finn will open the attackWelcome back.. A new opening combination for Australia. Joe Burns has a new partner in Aaron Finch. Finn has the new ball for England. Two slips in place..Taylor: "It was nice to finally get a hundred. We have got a decent total and it wasn't easy to score out there. It (the pitch) just held up nicely for their spinners. To be able to play so fluently was outstanding (talking about Morgan's knock). Hopefully the dew doesn't come on and make batting easy for the Australian batsmen. I was itching to play more attacking shots, I gave it away in the last couple of games, so it was nice to go on and play well. Hopefully it's a match-winning score for us."He though couldn't kick on and was out for 101 after he tried to flat-bat a short delivery in the final over. The lower-order somehow got England to 300, but they will feel that they are 15-20 runs short, considering they were 236/4 after 40 overs. Cummins was the pick of the bowlers, taking 2 for 50 from his 10. Mitchell Starc had a very poor day at the office as he gave away 79 runs in his 10 overs, his worst figures in this format. The run-chase should be exciting. Can Australia take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the series? Or will England bounce back to keep the series alive? Join us in a short while for all the answers.Stokes came out and struggled with his timing. Maxwell, who accounted for the England captain, also got Stokes' wicket after he top-edged a slog sweep very high in the air. Bairstow tried hard to hit a few lusty blows, but apart from a six in the 46th over, he couldn't quite get going and got out for 17. Ali then miscued a pull off Cummins and Pattinson took a simple catch to send him back for 1. England then lost their third wicket in a space of 8 runs as Plunkett got run-out after he decided to take off for a non-existent single. Even though Taylor struggled to get his timing right during the slog overs, he did enough to reach his maiden ODI hundred.Taylor was then joined by Morgan and both the batsmen then sensibly kept the scoreboard ticking without taking many risks. There was a brief period when Pat Cummins' pace troubled the Englishmen, especially Morgan, but the duo settled in nicely after the pacer was taken off the attack, bowling 5 overs in his first spell. Morgan though should have been out early in his innings, but a missed stumping chance at the hands of Wade saw Australia pay dearly as the English skipper went on to register his second consecutive fifty of the series. Taylor too finally followed his two 40+ scores in the first two ODIs and laboured his way to his 6th ODI fifty. Morgan fell while trying to hit one out of the park, caught at long-off and this ended his 119-run union with Taylor for the third wicket.England got off to a reasonable start with Jason Roy getting off to a flier. With 17 runs off one over from Starc, 4 boundaries coming in the over, England were on top. His partner, Alex Hales, though struggled to get his timing right. Despite putting on 52 for the first wicket, Hales' contribution was a lowly 9. Roy continued to play aggressively and soon registered his second ODI fifty, also his second in the three games of this series. He however threw his wicket away while trying to put pressure on the debutant, Ashton Agar. The left-arm spinner picked his maiden ODI wicket when Roy checked his big booming lofted-drive and Maxwell took the catch on the second attempt at short cover.4

Starc marks his run-up. 40,000 people expected for what should be a cracker of a game. Two slips waiting for the edge. All ready to roll...Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Joe Burns, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Marsh, Ashton Agar, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, James PattinsonEngland (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jonathan Bairstow(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Steven FinnSmith: "We would have batted first as well, the wicket looks a bit dry. We've got an extra spinner for this game. Unfortunately we have a few forced changes. Pattinson, Agar and Finch are in the side. You always want to win a series and we've got a good opportunity here. Hopefully we'll do well."Morgan: "We are going to bat first. Hopefully we'll get a good score on the board and defend it later. One change, Bairstow comes in place of Buttler. We decided before that Jonny (Bairstow) would be the reserve keeper and Sam Billings would be the reserve batter."England have won the toss and have opted to batThere is news coming in that Tom Moody has just presented Ashton Agar the ODI cap. So the left-arm spinner will make his debut today.Steven Smith and Eoin Morgan had different opinions regarding Stokes' incident and no wonder Aussies had to face a lot of BOOS from the English crowd. Even the former Aussie legend Merv Hughes, who was present at the ground, was jeered following Stokes' dismissal. It will be a do-or-die game for the Englishmen. Will they bounce back in style? We'll find out soon, stay tuned for the toss and team news...David Warner was injured the first ball he faced in the second ODI and he will be replaced by the Victorian-lad Aaron Finch who is playing his first international game since the World Cup. For England, Jos Buttler is given a rest ahead of the UAE tour and Bairstow, who had an impressive outing in the only ODI he played against New Zealand, will take his place.Hola everybody! It's squeaky bum time for England. If they lose this game, the series will also be lost. Following the Ben Stokes controversial dismissal in the previous ODI, things have heated up between both the sides. Eoin Morgan and his men would be keen to get back to winning ways, especially after being outplayed by the mighty Aussies in the first two games.Preview:Australia are a different team altogether in the one-day format. The World Champions have seven consecutive ODI wins against England and now with two comprehensive victories in the first two matches, they will be looking forward to gain an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series.In both games in this series, Australia batted first to post competitive 300-plus totals, which England failed to chase despite getting off to solid starts. The tourists boast of a strong batting line-up, which will be affected by the absence of David Warner and Shane Watson who picked up injuries in the 2nd ODI. The likes of Steven Smith, George Bailey, and Glenn Maxwell will have to take up the responsibility to make up for that loss. Mitchell Marsh has been terrific and the visitors can rely on his all-round capabilities to get them through tough times. On the other hand, their bowlers have done a good job so far, providing the necessary breakthroughs and keeping England on the back foot.England, meanwhile, have some serious problems to address. They have performed well in patches and have largely been unable to capitalize on the chances that came their way. Although Eoin Morgan is leading from the front with some good knocks, he has not got the necessary support from other batsmen. Even the bowlers, who have kept things tight in the middle overs, have been unable to prevent runs at death. Another one of England's concerns has been their poor fielding. Dropped catches and missed run-out chances have only added to their woes.Date: September 8, 2015Time: 18:30 IST, 13:00 GMTVenue: Old Trafford, ManchesterWeather: Cloudy with a maximum temperature of 17 degree CelsiusTeam News:EnglandJos Buttler, who has been out of form for quite some time, was replaced by Jonathan Bairstow for the final three matches. Buttler managed only scores of 4 and 0 in the first two ODIs. Bairstow's original omission from the squad for this series was surprising given that it was the Yorkshireman's aggressive 83 not out that helped England to a 3-2 one-day series win over New Zealand.Liam Plunkett, who had replaced Mark Wood in the second ODI, did an impressive job overall and is likely to keep his place.Probable XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan (c), Ben Stokes, Jonathan Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Steven FinnAustraliaAustralia's star opening batsman David Warner, who was hit by a Steven Finn delivery in the first over of the second ODI, was ruled out for the rest of the series with a broken thumb. Shane Watson, nursing a calf strain and Nathan Coulter-Nile with a hamstring injury are unlikely to take any further part in the series. Australia have drafted the recovered Aaron Finch, batsman Peter Handscomb and pacer John Hastings in the side as replacements.Probable XI: Joe Burns, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith (c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Peter Handscomb, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade (wk), Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, James Pattinson/John HastingsStats and TriviaAustralia have won nine consecutive ODI matches so far.Steven Finn is just four away from getting to 100 wickets in ODIs.Quotes"It's a little bit of a surprise as I haven't played for Australia since 2012 but I never gave up hope and thought that if I kept on doing the right things then I would have a chance."- John Hastings after receiving a call-up to return to the side"It probably took away from the fact that we haven't actually played very good cricket in the first couple of games which is the biggest thing for us so we just have to put it behind us."- Ben Stokes on his controversial dismissal in the second ODITeams:Australia (From): Joe Burns, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Peter Handscomb, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), John Hastings, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, James Pattinson, Ashton Agar, Marcus StoinisEngland (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jonathan Bairstow(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Steven Finn, Mark Wood, David Willey, Sam BillingsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
