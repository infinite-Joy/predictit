BANGLADESH:0.1  Botha to Iqbal, no run, slightly short delivery to begin with, Iqbal defends itIqbal and Kayes are at the crease. Iqbal is on strike. Botha will open the attackWelcome back to the Bangladesh chase, Bangladesh have a mountain to climb if they are to keep their quarter-final hopes alive.du Plessis: It is a really good score on this wicket and it is a very difficult wicket. It is not easy to play shots right from the start. It was tough against the spinners and the pitch is keeping slow and low.South Africa will be very happy with their effort. Amla and Smith got them off to a great start and the Bangladeshi bowlers toiled hard. However, the openers departed in quick succession and for some time in the middle overs, Bangladeshi spinners stifled the scoring rate. However, they encountered a massive obstacle in Jacques Kallis who scored his 82nd ODI fifty. He was joined by the calm du Plessis and they scored freely, with du Plessis getting to his 2nd ODI fifty. However, Bangladesh staged a mini-recovery by picking quick wickets in the Batting PP. The fall of wickets did not dampen the rate of scoring as SA scored 52 runs. However, Peterson struck boundaries at will and propelled SA to 284/8. This is a very tough score for the Bangladeshis on a wicket that is becoming slower and lower. Can Bangladesh survive South Africa's three pronged spin attack? Join us in a short while for the run-chase.4

Morne Morkel and Steyn are rested today ahead of some crucial encounters.South Africa have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: There are some cracks and it is dry. There is a bit of moisture on this wicket and there will be some movement early on in the innings. Teams that win the toss will want to bowl first.Hello and Welcome to this crucial encounter between South Africa and Bangladesh at Mirpur. This is a must-win game for the Tigers as they look to enter the quarters. South Africa, on the other hand, will be looking to top the group with a victory today. It promises to be an exciting encounter.by Saurabh SomaniThis will either mark the final time Bangladeshi fans see their team at the World Cup, or it will mark the start of the kind of celebration the country has never seen. South Africa have already qualified for the quarter-finals, but for Bangladesh the moment of truth has arrived.Bangladesh: Before the tournament, a run of positive results had encouraged the Bangladesh side and its fans to think of their cricket team as genuine contenders rather than the minnow tag they had in the past. During their campaign, they have lived up to that epithet spectacularly as they did against England, and it has seemed too heavy a burden to bear as it did against the West Indies. The equation for them now is very simple: win and progress to the quarter-finals, lose and watch the rest of the World Cup from home. Perhaps it is just as well that the final test comes against the toughest opponents and the Group leaders. If Bangladesh have to upset South Africa though, a number of things have to go their way. Their leading players - Tamim Iqbal, Shakib al Hasan, Shafiul Islam - must be at their absolute best, and amongst the rest of the team, there cannot be anything less than a concerted 120 percent effort. Their best bet will probably lie in producing a slow turning pitch, on which their army of spinners can be unleashed. They will be wary though, of the new avatar of the South African team, which is not only proficient at playing spin, but also has a host of spinners of its own. Bangladesh can also expect some chin music from the South African pacers, with Graeme Smith indicating that the Bangladeshi batsmen prefer to play on the front foot, and they'd have plans for that.South Africa: All South Africa need for their team to sport a complete look is for Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis to be among the runs and Imran Tahir to be fit. Smith and Kallis are far too good players to be in form ruts for long, while Tahir looks ready to start taking wickets by the bagful once again. With Tahir there, South Africa have the variety and class in their attack that they lacked without a quality spinner, and if Smith and Kallis get among the runs, South Africa will have a top-order that is rivalled only by the Indian line-up. South Africa may opt to rest Dale Steyn and/or Morne Morkel and give the talented Llonwabo Tsotsobe a go, but with the knock-outs so close, they may opt for a full-strength eleven too. They will also be targeting an assured top-of-the-table finish, so that they play the fourth-ranked side from Group A. South Africa's sole point of concern would probably be the form of keeper Morne van Wyk, who has been less than inspiring behind the stumps. They may not want to risk AB de Villiers in this game as keeper, though he looks set to return as a batsman, but even if AB were fit to keep, South Africa would want the luxury of a competent and able back-up, which van Wyk hasn't looked like so far.Trivia:Bangladesh's sole ODI win against South Africa came in the last World Cup in the Caribbean. While they will draw inspiration from that, they will do well to not dwell too much on the past, since it is the match today that has far more consequence than the one four years ago ever did.Quotes:"Bangladeshi spinners have bowled 41 overs at an average in every match. We have studied their videos and will be well-prepared to deal with any situation." - Graeme Smith has done his homework and is prepared.
"The plan is simple. If we bat first we must put up a good score and then restrict them for a lower total. If we field first, we will have to score one run more than what they put up." - Shakib al Hasan keeps it simple when asked what strategy would be used.
