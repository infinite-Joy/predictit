Rahim mentioned at the toss about restricting Nepal to a modest total and his bowlers have responded very well. Al Amin Hossain's double strike dented Nepal big time as both Malla and Sagar Pun were dimissed. The Khadka-Vesawkar 85-run stand steadied the ship but while looking for some big runs in the death over, both perished. Al Amin came back to bowl a brilliant final over to dent Nepal further. With a lot of dew around, batting should be easy now. Join us back in a short while for the Bangladesh reply.1
