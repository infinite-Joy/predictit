Chibhabha is on strike. Mustafizur Rahman will open the attackWe are back and let's see how Zimbabwe go about the chase. Such targets are always tricky. Chibhabha and Chakabva are out in the middle. Mustafizur  will open the attack. Here we go...Earlier in the day, losing wickets at the regular interval never allowed the Bangladeshi innings to flourish. The major area of concern was that batsmen got out after settling in. The pitch has a lot of turn on offer and the hosts would rely on their spinners to do the job for them. Zimbabwe, on the other hand, know that they have executed their plans perfectly in the first half and all they need is some patience to get through this. Will the visitors get through this total by pulling off partnerships? We will know in a while. Join us back soon as we bring you Zimbabwe's reply.Bangladesh have somehow managed to get close to 250 but will it be enough on this track? Remember they don't have Shakib Al Hasan today and they strenghtened their batting by replacing him with Imrul Kayes. So they are one bowler short effectively.4
