Some pleasing news from the ground as the sun is shinning brightly and we are in for an exciting game. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info....by Vishaal LoganathanThe series between England and Pakistan is struggling to come out of the giant shadow cast by spot-fixing and what it needs is a keenly fought contest, but Pakistan's poor form seems to be never ending. The last match was the closest Pakistan came to a victory in some time and the embattled team can at least take some heart from their fighting performance.England, on the other hand, would be delighted at the way they seem to have gelled as a team and the way they have been performing. All their players seem to be peaking at the right time - ahead of the Ashes and the World Cup. The form of Davies up front is great news for the English as they can look forward to getting a good start from the openers.Amongst the positives for Pakistan are that some of their bowlers have hit a nice rhythm, and it was wonderful to see Shoaib Akhtar back to bowling the way he did. It was also nice to see Kamran Akmal sparkle with the bat, putting behind the controversy that has surrounded him.Squads:England will be quite content with their display in the first match. Davies' show with the bat was sparkling and Anderson was fantastic with the ball. There are no concerns regarding form and fitness and they will mostly go with the same squad to press their advantage further in the series. Davies will look to continue his good form and stake a claim for a permanent slot in the squad. The middle order is already brimming with handy all rounders and Ravi Bopara will be delighted to have taken the opportunity given to put in a very important performance. All the bowlers chipped in with wickets, but Anderson was head and shoulders above the rest in the economy column with some tight bowling.Pakistan will be hoping that newbie Irfan and veteran Umar Gul pull up their socks after a terrible performance in the first match. Umar Gul will have no excuses for going at over 11 runs an over, and he will definitely want a better performance in this match. Irfan had a rather forgettable debut, and will want some numbers in the wickets column this time around. Saeed Ajmal took 4 wickets and along with Shoaib Akthar will be the captain's best bet for quick wickets or tightening the screws on the opposition.The Akmal brothers' batting would have brought some smiles back on in the dressing room. The elder Akmal along with Hafeez played a steady hand to give Pakistan a good start and give them some hope of getting close to the target. They will be worried about their middle order not being able to put together a good partnership though and will hope Mohammad Yousuf comes good in this match. He has fished his team out of troubled waters on many occasions.Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi, admitted to the team making a few mistakes in the last game and this time around, they will want to iron out the errors. England will still go in as favourites for this match, but with Pakistan's form seemingly on the upswing, there will be no room for complacency from the hosts.Teams:England (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Steve Davies(w), Jonathan Trott, Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Michael Yardy, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Luke Wright, Ryan Sidebottom, Ajmal ShahzadPakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Kamran Akmal(w), Mohammad Yousuf, Umar Akmal, Fawad Alam, Shahid Afridi(c), Asad Shafiq, Umar Gul, Mohammad Irfan, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Shahzaib Hasan, Azhar Ali, Abdul Razzaq, Wahab RiazLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
