SOUTH AFRICA:49.6 49.6 Franklin to McLaren, SIX, McLaren you beauty! What a stunning way to end the match! What a brave shot as well. A short of length delivery on the off, McLaren goes on his knees and paddle-whips it over fine leg, he just wanted to clear the man inside the ring but he has timed it superbly and it goes all the way. A brilliant finish to a brilliant game.Lonwabo Tsotsobe, right handed bat, comes to the creaseCan McLaren help South Africa avoid a whitewash? They had crossed over while the ball was in the air. What an end to this series. So many nervous faces everywhere in the stadium. The NZ camp, the SA dressing room and the crowd.

SOUTH AFRICA:47.6  Neesham to Phangiso, FOUR, where did that come from? Phangiso has played a beauty out of nowhere. Fine leg was inside the ring so he walked across and paddled it to the fine leg fence, not good stuff from Neesham as the ball was short
SOUTH AFRICA:47.5  Neesham to McLaren, 1 run, defends it softly to cover for one more, they're doing it in singles

Kleinveldt b Mitchell McClenaghan 6(5) [4s-1] Mitchell McClenaghan to Kleinveldt, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
SOUTH AFRICA:46.4  Mitchell McClenaghan to Kleinveldt, FOUR, the bouncer strategy doesn't work this time. A slow bouncer this time, Kleinveldt pulls it away to fine leg, the fielder was inside the circle so it wasn't a great option from McClenaghan

It has been rolled in and it is a nice track to bat on.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Graeme Smith, Colin Ingram, Farhaan Behardien, Faf du Plessis(c), David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Rory Kleinveldt, Dale Steyn, Aaron Phangiso, Lonwabo TsotsobeNew Zealand (Playing XI): BJ Watling, Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Grant Elliott, Brendon McCullum(w/c), James Franklin, Colin Munro, Nathan McCullum, Jimmy Neesham, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghanFaf du Plessis: "I am happy to bowl.

We have to put a big score today. The team is unchanged. We have to focus on whitewashing South Africa 3-0."New Zealand have won the toss and elected to batSouth Africa, on the other hand, have been totally outclassed in this series. The bowling failed to deliver the knock-out punch in the first ODI while their batting imploded in the second.Welcome one and all to the third and final ODI between South Africa and New Zealand from Potchefstroom. New Zealand achieved history by winning at Kimberly, thus securing an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three match series. They will be looking to go one better and achieve a whitewash over the Proteas, something which they have never achieved in their history.PreviewIf the first leg of the South Africa tour was plain misery for the BlackCaps, they have managed to turn a new leaf in the shorter formats of the game. The win at Kimberley marked the first time that a New Zealand squad had won a series against South Africa in South Africa. Having accomplished the unthinkable, the visitors would like to end the tour with another coup, a series whitewash against a team that was ranked No.1 when the matches began. South Africa: Nothing much has gone right for Gary Kirsten's men in the shorter format of the game.They have not been able to carry forward the form in Tests to the other versions of the game and have also lost the coveted No. 1 rank during the duration of the ODI series. Their plight has not been helped with the suspension of their regular skipper, AB de Villiers and the absence of Hashim Amla and Robin Peterson due to injuries. With Jacques Kallis also missing out, the top-order lacks the spark and quality that has made this team unassailable in Tests. Coach Gary Kirtsen has admitted that the performances has not been up to scratch but insisted that patience is the key as the team looks ahead with a long vision plan. "It's not nice (to have lost the series). I don't think we've played very well, but we've acknowledged that. It's amazing how quickly things change in cricket. I think we've taken a lot out of it,[so] it's important for us to fulfil a longer term vision. You need to take a few steps back," Kirsten said. South Africa have a proud record of having never lost a match at Potchefstroom and they would this record to remain the same after Friday's encounter. New Zealand: A camp which was simmering with discontent at the start of the tour wears a more relaxed atmosphere as the visitors seek to end their tour on a new high. The Kiwis were always expected to be more competitive in the shorter formats of the game but they have perhaps surprised even their biggest supporters by winning the series with a match still to play. The visitors have made light of the absence of several of their top stars as the newcomers have more or less made up to some extent. Kane Williamson, regarded as one of the best future prospects to emerge showcased his ability in the second match but it has been more of a complete team effort from Brendon McCullum's boys. Bowling coach Shane Bond wants nothing short of a 3-0 whitewash as he seeks some salvation from what has been a tough tour. "Two-nil is a great result for us but 3-0 will be even better, especially after the tour we have had, " Bond was happy to admit. Team News: Hashim Amla complained of a quad-muscle strain and has been rested as a precautionary measure. Dean Elgar has been named as his replacement. Robin Peterson is out of the final ODI after receiving stitches on his webbing during the second ODI. Aaron Phangiso is expected to make his ODI debut. New Zealand might well stick to the winning combination as they seek a rare series whitewash.Teams:South Africa (From): Faf du Plessis(c), Quinton de Kock(w), Morne Morkel, Aaron Phangiso, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Farhaan Behardien, Rory Kleinveldt, David Miller, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Ryan McLaren, Graeme Smith, Colin Ingram, Dean ElgarNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), BJ Watling(w), Trent Boult, Ronnie Hira, Nathan McCullum, Colin Munro, Rob Nicol, James Franklin, Martin Guptill, Mitchell McClenaghan, Jimmy Neesham, Neil Wagner, Kane Williamson, Grant Elliott, Kyle MillsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
