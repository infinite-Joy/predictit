SCOTLAND:4.5 Starc to Machan, no run, loud shout for lbw, umpire Illingworth says not-out. That looked plumb to the naked eye. Australians contemplate a review, but decide against it.

Unless, he hit it, that was cannoning into middle and leg.

SCOTLAND:0.4 Starc to Coetzer, no run, toe-crushing yorker, Coetzer almost falls over as he digs it out, he does well to bring his bat down in time and squeeze it to square leg. Had he missed that, it was right on the stumps, would have been out lbw or bowled

It's a great wicket and we played here the other night. We want to get the runs on the board. It should play well the whole game, so we want to get first use of it and put the runs on the board (on the pitch). It's very exciting, I don't think it gets much better than this for us (on playing against Australia). There have been some really good efforts throughout the tournament, we haven't seen a full package from our team and hopefully, we can see that today. Nice to get a few runs, I think myself and Freddie (Coleman) put a nice partnership in the last game. Hopefully, we can do the same today.'Clarke: 'We are going to have a bowl. I think it is a fantastic wicket, there is some rain forecast and that's our main reason for bowling. I think the ground is in a fantastic condition, we are in for a great game. It's a tough one, the selectors have gone for their best eleven, what they feel is the best eleven to win this game against Scotland (on getting the combination right). I think that's the right decision. It's a tough one to bat first or bowl first. Obviously, I would have liked to bat first, so our batters can get a hit, but the number one priority is to win the game. I think we have seen throughout the tournament that you can't take the team lightly. Scotland have played some really good competitive cricket and we have got to be at our best. We have gone for Cummins in for Doherty, that's our only change.'Australia have won the toss and have opted to fieldRemember, if it's a washout, Australia will finish 3rd in Pool A, since both Sri Lanka and Australia will be tied on 8 points, but Sri Lanka have 4 wins and Australia will only have 3. Sri Lanka will finish higher than Australia and we will see an Australia-South Africa clash in the quarter-finals.Head-to-Head: Both Australia and Scotland have played 4 ODIs against each other, with Australia winning all those games. In fact, in their last 3 meetings, the Aussies have at least scored 334.Pitch Report: 'The Scots should feel at home with the kind of weather we have today. This is a really good batting track, it is pretty hard, there is a nice covering of grass, but nothing as such to trouble the batsmen. It looks like a flat pitch, if Australia bat first they should score at least 350,' reckons Mark WaughHello folks! My co-commentator Akshay Maanay and I, Sidhant Maheshwari, will be with you for the entire duration of the game. We will have the toss and teams in a short while. Stay tuned.Weather report: The conditions are quite overcast right now, with a few showers predicted later in the day. It could well turn out to be a start-stop day. Luckily, it's not raining right now and we should start right on time. The maximum temperature is expected to be around 22 degrees Celsius today.Team News: Australia have already named their playing eleven. They have made only one change to their winning combination against Sri Lanka, with Xavier Doherty giving way to Pat Cummins. For Scotland, there is still no place for Majid Haq, who was sent home after he claimed that his exclusion from the team was racially motivated. They could probably field an unchanged side.AustraliaAustralia have been in terrific form in the past few games. Apart from their loss against New Zealand, a game that went down right to the wire, Australia have been very dominant in their other games. Also, their game against Bangladesh was washed out without a ball being bowled. Their biggest win came against Afghanistan, where they went on to make 417 batting first, the highest score in World Cup history. In reply, Afghanistan folded for 142 and Australia won that game by a mammoth 275-run margin.In their last match against Sri Lanka, riding on Maxwell's century and fifties from Smith, Clarke and Watson, Australia scored 376 in their 50 overs. In reply, with a ton from Sanga and fifties from Dilshan and Chandimal, Sri Lanka were well on their way to achieve the target. They were 283/4 at one stage, but the Australian bowlers came back strongly, taking 5 wickets for 29 runs and in the end, Australia won by 64 runs. Now, they will look to continue their good form and they'll be hoping that all the players have a good outing in the middle.ScotlandScotland have not won a single game in this World Cup or the previous editions they have participated in. The closest they got to a World Cup win was in their game against Afghanistan, a game that Afghanistan won by a solitary wicket. They gave New Zealand a tough fight in a low-scoring encounter, but were comprehensively beaten by England and Sri Lanka. Even though they managed a total of 318 against Bangladesh, it wasn't enough as Bangladesh recorded the second highest successful run-chase in World Cup history.With the kind of form Australia are in, it will be very difficult for them to pull off an upset here, but at least they can go out of the World Cup with a good showing against one of the best teams in the world. In their last game against Sri Lanka, their captain Preston Mommsen and Freddie Coleman, both registered fifties, but Scotland lost 6 wickets for 53 runs and were eventually bowled out for 215. Their problem has been that they haven't clicked as a unit, they have had some great individual performances but nothing to show for as a unit. Today, they will be looking to change that.13:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: Australia and Scotland will lock horns in Hobart in what is going to be a dead rubber. This is the last Pool game for both the sides and for Scotland, this is going to be their last game of the World Cup. Australia would ideally want their players to spend quality time in the middle before the knockouts. On the other hand, Scotland have not won a game yet and their priority will be to put up a fight against the mighty Aussies. Let's take a look at how both the teams have done so far.Preview:Though a statistical mismatch, Australia's final Pool A game against Scotland at Bellerive Oval in Hobart gives them the opportunity to polish the rough edges around their campaign in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 so far. Still searching for their first victory in World Cups, Scotland return home irrespective of the result but will hope to put up a stronger display than they have during the course of the tournament.Venue: Bellerive Oval, HobartDate: March 14, 2015Time: 0900 Hrs ISTWeather: A maximum of 21 degrees with showers predicted in the afternoonTeam newsAustraliaDespite putting up dominant performances against England and Sri Lanka, Australia haven't looked like their usual self yet, and their defeat to New Zealand and the rained out game with Bangladesh means some of the players haven't spent enough time in the middle. Australia captain Michael Clarke has indicated that the batting order will be shuffled around to let some of his players get a decent hit in the middle, which may see the captain himself come in at No 3, especially if Scotland decide to bat first on winning the toss.Australia have already announced their XI for the game with Pat Cummins replacing left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty, who had played in the previous game against Sri Lanka in Sydney. There, however, continues to be no place for local boy George Bailey, who was left out of the side since Clarke returned to the side.Probable XI: Aaron Finch, David Warner, Michael Clarke (capt), Steven Smith, Shane Watson, James Faulkner, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins.ScotlandScotland came agonizingly close to recording their first-ever World Cup win against Afghanistan but with just one more game to be played and that too against Australia, the elusive first victory will have to wait. The last time they played Australia in the World Cup was way back in 1999 when the to-be champions had a bit of a stutter, and Scotland would seek inspiration from that game to instill some confidence in themselves.Despite suffering heavy defeats, some of Scotland's players have thrived on the big stage with impressive performances. Until Trent Boult took a couple of wickets against Bangladesh on Friday, Scotland medium-pacer Josh Davey was leading the bowling charts for the tournament, which they should be proud of. Kyle Coetzer has trailed off since his 156 against Bangladesh, but will look for one last flourish in this campaign.Majid Haq's controversial removal from the squad after his omission from Scotland's last game should not affect the make-up of the team, which in all likelihood will remain unchanged against Australia.Probable XI: Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen (capt), Freddie Coleman, Richie Berrington, Michael Leask, Matthew Cross (wk), Rob Taylor, Josh Davey, Alasdair EvansWatch out forJames Faulkner has had a quiet World Cup so far, especially after missing the first few games with injury. He has been steady with the ball but hasn't had enough time in the middle with the bat and was run out first ball against Sri Lanka. A promotion up the order could be likely and it may just be the fillip Faulkner needs ahead of the knockout stages of the competition.After scoring a half-century in his first World Cup game, Matt Machan has failed to convert the starts he has got in the subsequent matches, and against Australia he will look to correct that. Machan has looked comfortable against both pace and spin and looked solid, but the 24-year-old will hope to impress against the toughest set of bowlers he has come up against yet.Quotes"I think we'd be silly to pick our team today for the World Cup quarter-final. We don't know what we're going to get in Adelaide, we don't know what the wicket will be like; we still don't know who we will be playing against." - Michael Clarke is not looking too far ahead in the ICC Cricket World Cup.StatsThe last time Australia and Scotland played in a World Cup was back in 1999.

Australia coach Darren Lehmann had played in that game and was out for a second ball duck.Teams:Scotland (From): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen(c), Freddie Coleman, Richie Berrington, Michael Leask, Matthew Cross(k), Rob Taylor, Josh Davey, Alasdair Evans, Hamish Gardiner, Safyaan Sharif, Iain WardlawAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Brad Haddin(k), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, George Bailey, Xavier Doherty, Mitchell MarshLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
