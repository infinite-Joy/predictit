It is dry and hard. There are a few cracks as well. It will be slow and lots of turn is expected. Team winning the toss will look to bowl first.Zimbabwe, meanwhile, are trying hard but lapses in concentration while batting has brought about their downfall. Both the ODI games were very similar to each other, the only difference being the margin of Zimbabwe's defeats. Their bowling at death was considerably better in the second game but their batting remains highly inconsistent. Whether they can improve upon it remains to be seen. With nothing left to lose, can they achieve the impossible? Hello and a warm welcome to the final ODI at Bulawayo. Toss and teams coming up in a few minutes. Stay tuned...South Africa have already won the 3-match ODI series 2-0. For them, the game today will focus on utilizing their reserve players. Hashim Amla has already been given rest and Rilee Rossouw is expected to take his place. Marchant de Lange and Mthokozisi Shezi might also get an opportunity to showcase their talents. Even though they were bowled out in the previous game, there is little the visitors have to worry about.Teams:South Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Rilee Rossouw, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Wayne Parnell, Ryan McLaren, Imran Tahir, Kyle Abbott, Aaron Phangiso, Hashim Amla, Marchant de Lange, Mthokozisi SheziZimbabwe (From): Hamilton Masakadza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Sikandar Raza, Brendan Taylor, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura(c), Luke Jongwe, Prosper Utseya, Neville Madziva, John Nyumbu, Brian Vitori, Vusi Sibanda, Tinashe Panyangara, Malcolm Waller, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Timycen Maruma, Shingirai MasakadzaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
