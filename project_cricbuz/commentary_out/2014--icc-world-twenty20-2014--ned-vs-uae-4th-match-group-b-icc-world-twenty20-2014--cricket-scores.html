We would have batted as well. Looks a good wicket and now we'll have to put the runs on the board. Hopefully some dew makes life difficult for their bowlers. I think we've learnt from the losses in the warm-ups and we'll do well tonight."Khurram: "It feels wonderful to be back. 1996 is when we played at the highest level, it's good to be here. We will bat first. We've seen the match earlier here and I think it's a good wicket to bat on. The ball swung around late in the evening. I think anything close to 140- 150 will be a good total."United Arab Emirates have won the toss and have opted to batHello and welcome to the second game of today's first round matches. It's UAE taking on Netherlands. We had a fantastic first game here, with Ireland winning off the last ball over Zimbabwe. Netherlands didn't have the best of times in the warm-up games and lost both their matches, while UAE won one of their games. It will be interesting to see the playing XI of both the sides.
