Boult will open the attackWelcome back.. Boult has ther new ball with him. Two slips in place..The stadium wasn't quite choked with people but New Zealand's dear McBomb is never a function of that. Nor it is of the occasion. Exploded with 5 fours and 3 sixes in this Trans-Tasman opener to jet hosts off to an incredibly quick start. Guptill, progressively opening up, spread his wings later but fell short of a deserved ton courtesy a Maxwell stunner. Hazlewood, after the initial drywash, got progressively better as he took Williamson out for nought and then consumed Ronchi who was warming up for the late slogathon. Nicholls' second ODI fifty and some late Santner hits steered the total near safe borders but nothing feels safe on this park and Warner-armoured Australia will come out swinging hard. Join us for the chase in about 30 minutes..4

Here's Anderson. Elliott c Hastings b Mitchell Marsh 21(18) [4s-2 6s-1]Mitchell Marsh to Elliott, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

NEW ZEALAND:28.4 Hazlewood to Elliott, SIX, that was launched, literally. Full ball, Elliott's bat-maker's label says hello to Hazlewood who sees the ball fly over his head. Short boundaries but that was courtesy all the timing forced down that ball's throat

NEW ZEALAND:27.3 Mitchell Marsh to Elliott, no run, stretches as far as he could and defends it into the off-side
NEW ZEALAND:27.2 Mitchell Marsh to Henry Nicholls, 1 run, Maxwell at the moment resembles a piece of dough that can stretch, fly and complete run outs. Nicholls had patted the ball back and wanted to rotate the strike but Maxwell swoops in from mid-off and under-armed the throw as he dived forward. Just a wide enough throw to allow Nicholls back in. And he seemed to have hurt his elbow and is off the ground

NEW ZEALAND:25.4 Mitchell Marsh to Henry Nicholls, no run, Maxwell is on fire. Pulls out a full length dive at cover-point and stops a certain run.

Nicholls doesn't call for the run but a hungry Guptill responds, has to be sent back but Maxwell's arm is as good as any. Hits the bull's eye at the bowler's end and Guptill is found short - of the crease and his ton. Guptill run out (Maxwell) 90(76) [4s-8 6s-5]Faulkner to Henry Nicholls, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!

What will be the team combination for New Zealand? We'll find out shortly.Feburary 28, 2015. What a day it was for New Zealand and cricket itself. Almost a year later, we are back to Eden Park for the beginning of the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. Hello and a warm welcome to the first ODI of the 3-match series. All eyes would be on Brendon McCullum, who has announced that he will retire after the Test series later this month. Both the hosts and the visitors are fresh from series wins (in the ODIs) over Pakistan and India respectively.Preview:For New Zealand, it be will be the beginning of an end when they take on trans-Tasman rivals Australia in the first One-Day International (ODI) of the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy at Eden Park in Auckland on Wednesday (February 3).Brendon McCullum, who is set to retire after the T20I series later in the month, will look to bid adieu to his ODI career on a note as pleasant as the entertainment he has provided to the cricket world so far.McCullum will be leading a fairly inexperienced side that will be without the services of Ross Taylor, Tim Southee and Mitchell McClenaghan. Nonetheless, with the likes of Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell, Matt Henry and Adam Milne in the squad, they possess as strong a bowling attack as any side in the world.The world champions Australia will be looking to continue what they did against India ( a series that they won 4-1)even as injury woes continue to keep quite a few players out of action. The hamstring strain to Aaron Finch will allow the team management to try out more options from the vast reservoir of in-form batsmen they boast of.Shaun Marsh is set to start in the first ODI, a move that unfortunately results in the snub of Usman Khawaja. "He does need a hit going into a big Test series for us and he's batting extremely well. He's unlucky to miss out but Shaun's getting the first opportunity. He played well in Australia and he's batting extremely well as well," Steve Smith said ahead of the first ODI.Josh Hazlewood, who has been out of action for a while, is set to lead the attack on Wednesday. Young leg-spinner Adam Zampa and pacer Scott Boland too will sit out in the first clash of the series."We've got quite an inexperienced bowling attack. We've got quite a few guys that are out but the guys are learning quite quickly," Smith added.Whether the pacers will thrive in swinging conditions or will the muscular men with beefy bats take advantage of the 58-metre straight boundary remains to be seen. The last time the two sides played an ODI in New Zealand, it was at the Eden Park during the Group A encounter of the ICC World Cup last year. None of the two sides, studded with power-hitters, could take advantage of the small boundary ropes then and the match turned out to be a low-scoring thriller.Teams:Australia (From): David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Marsh, James Faulkner, John Hastings, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Shaun Marsh, Kane Richardson, Scott BolandNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Henry Nicholls, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Mitchell Santner, Matt Henry, Adam Milne, Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell, Colin MunroLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
