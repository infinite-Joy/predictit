West Indies managed to sneak a win in a rain affected game but Pakistan will not be too disappointed with the result. They had plenty of positives coming out of the game. West Indies will look to improve upon their performance and try to pull of another victory that will give them an end result of 3-2 instead of a much more comprehensive 4-1. Pakistan are expected to continue to test their bench strength. Stay tuned as we bring you the toss and team updates in a short while..by Gokul GopalWest Indies had some assistance from the rain when they managed to win the 4th One Day International against Pakistan but they will have to come up with an improved performance in the final ODI if they are to prevent Pakistan from finishing 4-1 in the series.West Indies: Lendl Simmons has been the driving force for the West Indies team through-out the series but unfortunately, he has not been getting support from the rest of the batsmen and the end result is that West Indies have not been able to put up a decent score on board all the three times they batted first in the series. In the fourth ODI, rain came to their favour as West Indies clinched a one run win as per the D/L method. Chasing 249, The Caribbean side were 154/4 after 29.5 overs when rain brought the play to a halt. Windies were ahead by just one run as per D/L method and that was possible thanks to a 6 in the 30th over by Dwayne Bravo off Afridi. Simmons was the star again, scoring a fine 76 and in this game, he did get some support from Darren Bravo and Ramnaresh Sarwan, who scored useful twenties. The batsmen need to combine well once again to keep Pakistan from winning the final ODI.West Indies bowling in the 4th ODI was not good to start with but they finished off well to restrict Pakistan. Devendra Bishoo impressed once again by taking 3 wickets for just 37 runs while Kemar Roach and Dwayne Bravo, who went for runs initially, came back well to pick up a couple of wickets each. While the Windies batsmen need to perform well, the bowlers too should contribute as the Caribbean side needs to get back into the groove ahead of the two-Test series.Pakistan: After getting off to a great start in the series with convincing win in the first two games, Pakistan's batting woes came back to haunt them. Despite winning the 3rd ODI to clinch the series, Pakistan still are battling problems with the batsmen failing on consecutive occasions. In the 3rd ODI, Misbah ul Haq played a fine innings which helped Pakistan to a narrow win but the side had some nervous moments as wickets went down quickly at the top and and also the middle order fell in succession after leading a recovery. In the 4th ODI, it was the middle order that was to be blamed as they could not capitalize on the brilliant century by Mohammad Hafeez and a useful 71 by Asad Shafiq. The middle order crumbled and Pakistan could only post a total of 248. Few more runs could have proved crucial in that match as the Duckworth-Lewis method was employed to determine the result. The batting needs to be more consistent for Pakistan as they will soon be playing the longer format of the game.The Pakistan bowlers have done a decent job throughout the series with Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal and Wahab Riaz taking the bulk of the wickets and also not giving away too many runs. Barring the 4th match, where some of the bowlers went for runs, the bowling department has been functioning well and would look to perform in the same vein in the 5th ODI as well as the Test series.Quotes:It has been a long time since we have beaten a top side, but we took the opportunity, and came through in the end. We will look to take confidence from it (win in the 4th ODI), and put it into play here: Darren Sammy hoping that his team can take the confidence into the last match.But I think we missed that chance, and we did not bat well in the end. It was disappointing because we missed an opportunity to score a big total, and we have to do much better, and show more consistency in the future: Shahid Afridi wants the batsmen to be more consistent.
