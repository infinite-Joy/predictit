This is a good chance for us to grab it. The pressure will be on the home team so we just need to keep doing what we have done until now. Sarfraz Ahmed comes in for Wahab Riaz.Mushfiqur: It looks like a good track to bat on but we would like to continue in the same way and bowl first. We have never played a final against Pakistan so they will be under pressure. We just need to enjoy the moment since we don't often get into the final. The team is exactly the same.Bangladesh have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch report: The pitch looks like the same as the one that hosted the match between Pakistan and India. There could be a lot of runs in it but Sunil Gavaskar thinks the pressure of a final may get to the players and hence the game might just not be a high scoring affair.Hello and welcome to the final match of what has been an extremely exciting Asia Cup. Bangladesh have fought against all odds to make it this far and in their journey have surprised some big teams. Today they are up against another formidable outfit and one that they lost to in the league stage, Pakistan. Misbah and his men will be eager to break Bangladesh's good run of form and will surely want to repeat what they did in the league stages with their opponenents. Bangladesh on the other hand will be desperate to finally win a major cricket tournament.The hosts, Bangladesh, have surprised everyone by pipping bigger team to make it to the final. Their confidence is at an all-time high but they will be facing a team against whom they lost earlier in the tournament. Both sides have a lot going for them and Vishal, taking sides with Pakistan, and Shashreek, who is backing Bangladesh, will answer each other's questions, some of which are probably on your mind too. Shashreek: Pakistan is heavily dependent on their famed bowling attack but that attack was taken apart by India in their previous clash. Does the thought that your team ,now, aren't doing too well in what they used to be best at, make you lose your sleep?Vishal: The India game was largely due to the brilliance of one man - Virat Kohli. If Bangladesh had such a player then there would be a sleepless night, but fortunately there's no one with that much talent. Also, the bowling line-up is famed for a reason, they know how to bounce back from a drubbing, and that's exactly what I expect from the likes of Saeed Ajmal and co.Shashreek: Batting seems to be Pakistan's strong point in this series surprisingly. Although the middle order hasn't been tested adequately and when they have, they haven't risen to the challenge. If the top order fails much like it did in the series against England, don't you think Pakistan could find themselves in middle of a deep ocean without the slightest sign of a life boat around?Vishal: You seem to be contradicting yourself, but yes the batting has been good with Hafeez and Jamshed playing well and that has been a major plus point for the team. Another half-decent start from the openers should be enough for the middle order to build on. We have a superb mixture of youth and experience in the middle order and that should see us through should there be any hiccups along the way.Shashreek: Wahab Riaz was quite a disappointment with the ball and Umar Akmal was a mess behind the stumps in the last game. Do you see the team management stringing a few changes together to try and correct the flaws that were exposed?Vishal: I don't see any reason to tinker with the line-up and even if we do there is more-than-able backup waiting in the wings. Umar Akmal had a decent outing against India and I'm sure he'll get better. He also offers a lot with the bat and could prove to be very important when the runs need to come faster. Wahab, on the other hand, has been a consistent performer for sometime now and has all the makings of a match-winner. Your turn to face the music, Shashreek.Vishal: Well, what a surpirse. Never thought we'd see Bangladesh in the final but, credit where it's due, well done. Having defied all odds to enter the final, do you fear that the players may suffer from a sense of complacency knowing no one will complain that they lost in the finals and will instead rejoice the team's inspired performance in the league stage?Shashreek: Yes of course Bangladesh has surprised the world with its performance in the series so far. No one expected Bangladesh to beat the finalists of the World Cup and no one expected them to make it to the final of the Asia Cup. Now is where the real test starts though. Despite the performances the only team that will still go in as underdogs is Bangladesh and if anyone will be complacent then it will probably be Pakistan as they were the table toppers. As for Bangladesh, there is nothing to lose and hence they can take the field without any pressure and play some fearless cricket! By the looks of it there might just be some more rejoicing to do for the Bangladeshi fans.Vishal: What changes would you expect the team and the management to make for the final? Or would you back the same team that beat Sri Lanka to beat Pakistan in the final?Shashreek: I think Shahadat was the only player who looked a little off colour in the game against Sri Lanka. Apart from him the side put in a flawless performance and played as a well organised unit. I guess the team would probably go in unchanged for the encounter against Pakistan as there always is a temptation not to change a winning combination.Vishal: The main threat for Bangladesh will be their lack of exposure to matches such as this one. The team has hardly played in the final of a tournament featuring 3 or more teams. How do you see them approaching a game like this?Shashreek: It is true that the whole scenario is a new one for Bangladesh but in that comes the advantage of not having any pressure. Pakistan will be expected to win the final and anything but a victory for them will be a poor result. Bangladesh on the other hand have already exceeded expectations and can go into the finals and play some good aggressive cricket. There could be a risk of getting over-awed by the situation but the composure that they showed in the match against Sri Lanka suggests otherwise.Vishal: Tamim Iqbal and Shakib's display so far in the series have been key to Bangladesh's fortunes in the tournament. I guess it's safe to say that bowling hasn't been Bangladesh's strength in the league stage with none of the Bangladesh bowlers in the top 6 wicket-takers. Do they have a contingency plan if their top order crumbles?Shashreek: The best part about Bangladesh is that they do not depend upon individuals. They play as a team and that is precisely why they don't have just one or two gems glistening in the records table. As a unit Bangladesh's bowling has been good, that is the sole reason why Sri Lanka were restricted to 231. It has been the collective effort of all the bowlers that has not allowed any opposition to score in excess of 300. That in itself speaks volumes about the bowling department that the hosts possess.Coming to the batting, Tamim has been solid but there have been others who have also contributed equally. Nasir Hossain and Mahmudullah have proved to be good finishers and with Shakib and Mushfiqur in the line up, the middle order looks like quite the powerhouse. Even if Bangladesh's top order does falter then the middle order should be able to resurrect the innings and pile on the runs.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Anamul Haque, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Nazmul Hossain, Shahadat Hossain, Tamim Iqbal, Abdur Razzak, Elias Sunny, Jahurul Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza, Nazimuddin, Shafiul Islam, Shakib Al Hasan, Nasir HossainPakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sarfraz Ahmed, Aizaz Cheema, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi, Umar Gul, Younis Khan, Abdur Rehman, Asad Shafiq, Hammad Azam, Nasir Jamshed, Wahab Riaz, Umar Akmal(w)LATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
