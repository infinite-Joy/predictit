The videos and visuals of the disaster have left us all in shock. We pray that it does not get any worse for them.It has been a strange innings from the West Indies. They got off to a slow start but the openers laid a solid platform. The innings however was defined in two distinct ways by Devon Smith and Kieron Pollard who propelled the West Indies to 275. Smith scored a gritty century, his first in ODIs and put WI firmly on track. It all started from the Batting PP when they blasted 55 runs in five overs. Although wickets kept falling at the other end, Pollard blasted the Irish bowlers to all parts as he scored a blazing 94. The Irish will be demoralized by this hitting and they will have to summon a lot of energy to chase this target down. Join us in a short while for the run-chase.4

The West Indies are fresh from a dominating performance against Bangladesh and will be looking to repeat the performance today against Ireland. The Celtic warriors, on the other hand, have been the giant killers in this tournament and have put in some great performances in this competition. This promises to be an exciting contest in the making. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Karthik LakshmananGenerally, a Test playing nation taking on an Associate team in a World Cup game doesn't invoke much interest from the cricketing world. The Test playing nation is assumed to be stronger and is expected to thrash the 'minnows', and any deviation from the expected result is termed an 'upset'. West Indies take on Ireland in one such Test team versus Associate nation in a group B encounter at Mohali, but this time, the contest is expected to be much closer and a victory to Ireland will not be termed an upset. The match is also very important considering the teams' positions in the table; it will decide if group B is headed in group A's direction with the top 4 Test teams qualifying for the knockouts, or if Ireland gives themselves a strong chance of making it to the next round.West IndiesTwo teams in world cricket are known for their unpredictability; one is Pakistan and the other is West Indies. True to their tag, the Caribbean side have put on contrasting performances in the 3 games played so far. They had a horror start to the World Cup - getting a thrashing at the hands of the mighty South Africans and losing all rounder Dwayne Bravo to an injury in the process. But a strong comeback followed in the next 2 games, as they defeated Netherlands and Bangladesh in more than convincing fashion. First, they walloped the Dutch by 215 runs and then, surprised everyone including themselves by bowling out Bangladesh for 58 runs in the next game at Dhaka, going on to win by 9 wickets.
West Indies would take confidence from the form of their batsmen and its fast bowler Kemar Roach. All the batsmen had a good hit against Netherlands, the most notable performances being Gayle's 80 and Pollard's blazing 60 in 27 balls. Darren Bravo, Devon Smith and Ramnaresh Sarwan also chipped in with useful runs, giving the batting line up a solid outlook. The bowling attack is lead by in form pacer Kemar Roach, who picked up back to back Man of the Match awards. The speedster picked up 6 wickets against Netherlands, including a hat trick and followed it up by taking 3 crucial wickets against Bangladesh to demolish the home team for just 58 runs. His opening partner, spinner Suliemann Benn is among the wickets too, picking up 8 wickets in the tournament so far.
The game against Ireland is crucial for the Windies. They are in a comfortable position with 4 points from 3 games and have a healthy net run rate. But, any slip-up against the Irish could make their job very difficult, for they face 2 tough opponents - England and India.IrelandIf there is one team that has made the case of Associates stronger, it is Ireland. The determined upstarts have already won the hearts of the cricketing fraternity, putting on spirited performances against tough opponents. The face of Ireland's campaign has been the unbelievable innings from Kevin O'Brien against England in Bangalore. The record breaking century rescued Ireland from 111 for 5 and helped them chase down a mammoth 327. They followed it up with another spirited performance against tournament favourites and home team India. Despite losing the game, the Irish put on a spirited effort and gave India a scare. Ireland would be cursing themselves for bungling their opening game against Bangladesh. After restricting Bangladesh to a paltry 205, Ireland went down from a strong 151 for 5 to 178 all out, thus losing by 27 runs.
Ireland would be happy that most of their top order batsmen have got off to starts in various parts of the tournament and would be hoping for one of them to convert it into a big score. Captain Porterfield, the O'Brien brothers and Cussack have been in good form and would be hoping for them to continue their good show. Their fielding is among the best in the world and Indian skipper Dhoni lavished praise on them saying Ireland scored 207, but the fielders made them chase 240 in their game in Bangalore. But Ireland have injury worries as all-rounder Trent Johnston is in doubt due to the knee injury sustained during their five-wicket defeat to India. Andre Botha, who missed the India match with a groin strain is expected to return.
A win against West Indies could give Ireland a serious chance of making it to the quarter finals. It is neither improbable nor impossible.Head to Head:The 2 sides have met 3 times so far, with West Indies coming out on top in all the encounters. They last met in an ODI in April 2010, where West Indies won by 6 wickets. The 2 sides have played each other once in World Cups, where West Indies made a comfortable win.Quotes:Sammy: The last few days there have been ups and downs but we have stuck together as a team. We have been managing it quite well so far. We are here to play cricket and the higher administration is there to handle the distractions.
Porterfield: We've played good cricket to this point and we've done our homework on the West Indies so we're looking forward to the game.
