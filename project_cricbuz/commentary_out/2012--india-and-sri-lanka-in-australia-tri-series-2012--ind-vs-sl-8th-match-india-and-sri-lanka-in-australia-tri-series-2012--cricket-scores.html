Back of length ball on the off, Parthiv stays in the crease and just lifts it straight up in the air, 2 fielders from point and cover, and the bowler himself converge and Malinga takes one of the simplest catches he will ever get.

An aboslutely ripper of a yorker on the legs, credit to Jadeja for digging it out with his boot but he started running madly, the fielder from point swooped in and tried to run him out but didn't hit the stumps, concedes an overthrow.

Short ball right on the stumps, Kohli looks to go over mid on but was hurried on by the pace on it, hits him high on the bat and hits it gently to mid on. He was dropped twice earlier, but not this time. India's chances are going down with each wicket.

At the moment, I don't see a weak link in this Sri Lankan bowling though..

It is a good wicket to bat on. We need to bat, bowl and field well. In most day-night games, it is a challenge for the top order. There are three changes in the team. Zaheer, Dhoni and Rohit Sharma are out. Parthiv Patel, Ashwin and myself are back. Rohit has been rested. Everybody are getting a rest so it is better to rest the youngsters as well.Mahela: It looks like a good wicket to bat on. We did a wonderful job in Sydney. I am confident that our seamers will do a good job. We have to be consistent with our gameplan.It is confirmed. Sehwag is fit and he will lead the side today.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: It is very hot says Chappelli. There is a lot of grass, but not green grass - which means that it will be very good for batting. At night, it might help the bowlers. Bat first and make sure that the other side bakes under the hot sun. 'Very difficult chasing' signs off Chappelli.Conditions are slightly overcast at the moment. Showers have been forecast today and one hopes that it stays away.Virender Sehwag might lead the team today and we could see Manoj Tiwary in the side today. Parthiv Patel will assume the wicketkeeper duties today. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will carry a lot of confidence into the match after their comprehensive win against Australia at Sydney. A win against the Indians will put them in a great position. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.It is game number eight in the CB series and the contest is wide open. Today's match between India and Sri Lanka at Brisbane assumes a lot of importance. India's huge defeat against Australia has curtailed their momentum and they will be without their skipper MS Dhoni, who has been handed a one-match ban for a poor over rate in the previous match.Preview by Karthik LakshmananA lot of interesting things are happening in the ongoing CB series in Australia. A match-winning last over 6 by India's MS Dhoni, an almost match-winning last over 6 by Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews, a controversial 5 ball over in a tied game, an almost-controversial wrong button press by the third umpire, questions over India's rotation policy, and to top it all, the axing of Ricky Ponting. Amidst all this, the tournament's league stage is moving towards a tight end, with both India and Sri Lanka interestingly poised in the table. India are currently placed above Sri Lanka at second position, but their net run rate is in the negative and have also played a game more than the Lankans. Sri Lanka, who have been gradually improving with each game in the tournament, will need to continue their momentum to put pressure on the remaining teams.India: India have a lot of important questions to answer, which starts from 'who will be the captain?'. MS Dhoni has received a one match suspension for poor over rate, which rules him out of the all-important clash against Sri Lanka. Virender Sehwag is the vice captain of the side, but has been in poor form and had to miss out of the previous games with 'back spasms' (or rotation policy). The other contender for the post is Gambhir, who has been in much better batting form than Sehwag and also tasted success in the past when leading the side. The next question for India will be 'should they stick by the rotation policy?'. India have stuck by their rotation policy giving various reasons like 'rest for seniors', 'opportunity for youngsters' and also improvement in fielding standards, but they might be forced to re-think the strategy for this match. With the race to the finals getting tighter, India may need to field their best eleven without giving too much thought to weird policies. The fact that India will be without one of its most consistent performers in the format also makes it imperative for the management to pick up the best available eleven, even if that means playing all 3 seniors at the top. However, Sachin Tendulkar suffered a shin injury while fielding on Sunday, and it is still unknown whether he has recovered enough to take the field just a day after. Parthiv Patel, who will come in for Dhoni, is also an opener and it will be interesting to see where he slots in.Next question: will be 'will Manoj Tiwary get a chance?'. Tiwary scored a century in the last ODI game he played, but is yet to get a game in the ongoing series. Rohit Sharma has been in poor form in the series, and the likes of Jadeja and Raina have been inconsistent too. Will India drop either of them to give Tiwary a game? Most of the questions for India are regarding India's batting, which has been disappointing but for one or two good shows. The bowling, despite the bad game against Australia on Sunday, looks in pretty good shape, but India will need to pick the right balance. India played 4 seamers in the previous game which forced Ashwin out of the team. He bowled well against Sri Lanka in the previous 2 outings, and may make a return to the bowling attack. Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka have been very competitive from the beginning and the performances (and the results) are improving with each game in the tournament. Twin losses were followed by a tie with India, which was backed up with a convincing thrashing of the Aussies. The difference in fortunes has come from their new captain - Mahela Jayawardene - who has been absolutely brilliant in the role. Never known to be a conventional captain, Mahela has taken the attack to the opposition and his tactics are paying off. In a move not known to be associated with Sri Lanka (or other Asian teams), Sri Lanka played an all-seam attack against Australia in Sydney and dismissed them for 158. Jayawardene promoted himself to the top of the order in the same match, and succeeded immediately with a match winning, unbeaten 61. He played Maharoof in the same game, and he responded with 2 vital wickets. A slight concern for Sri Lanka will be their top order - the likes of Sangakkara and Dilshan have been getting starts but the big scores have eluded them. Dinesh Chandimal's reputation has been growing with each match, but apart from Mathews, there are not too many batting options after him. Sri Lanka's bowling attack has a lot of variations and all they have to do is pick the right balance. Herath was left out for the previous match against Australia, but given his performance against India in the last clash, it won't be surprising if he returns. Their bowling has been backed up by their fielding, which has been absolutely terrific as shown by the Man of the Match award to Thisara Perera for his 2 run-outs in the game against Australia. Final word: The 2 teams are evenly matched, both in strength and in the position in the table. While it is still too early to predict the 2 finalists, it will be fair to say that this match may turn out to be the most important one so far. Intermittent rains and thunderstorms are forecast for Tuesday at Brisbane, and let's hope that rain doesn't have the final say.
