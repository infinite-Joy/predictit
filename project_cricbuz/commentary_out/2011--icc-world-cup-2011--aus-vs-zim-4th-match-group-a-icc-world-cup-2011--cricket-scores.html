Today the Zimbabweans have finished their quota in just 3 hours and 12 minutes - 18 before the allocated time.The spinners were touted to be Zimbabwe's strength and they have reinforced it after this innings. Ray Price opened the attack, a tactic they have used a few times before, and it worked like a charm today. The Aussie openers never quite managed to force the issue and the slow scoring in the first fifteen overs could prove to be costly. Will the Aussie spinners prove to be as effective? Will their strong pace attack find help under the lights? The Zimbabwe batsmen will definitely back themselves to give them a run for their money. It promises to be an interesting chase Join us shortly as we bring you all the action.4

Mpofu will be bowling.Australia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, David Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Jason Krejza, Brett Lee, Shaun TaitBrendan Taylor: We would like to face quicks like Tait, Lee and Johnson in Indian pitches as the wickets are a bit slow. The spinners are our main strength and there will be some variety in the form of our two pacers. We have been in good form for the last 16 months and we can give a tough fight.Just before going to the toss, Saurav Ganguly mentioned that he did not like the colour of the Australian jersey.Ponting: Everyone is fit and we are looking forward to the game today. Bollinger, Paine and Hastings miss out for today. The wicket is very good and there are a lot of runs on offer. It is nice to score some runs although the results did not go our way. The finger is well and I have no issues.Chigumbura: It is a good wicket and we would have batted also. If we play well, we can give a tough fight. We would like to restrict Australia to under 270.Australia have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: The weather is awesome and the outfield is very quick. The square boundaries are short and the Zimbabwe batsmen will want to take advantage against the Aussie pacemen. There is some grass on this wicket and there will be good carry for the bowlers. The dew problem will be under control as the groundsman did not water the pitch for three days. It is a very good cricket wicket.Watson: We are a different side to what we where eight years ago, but we will be giving our best in this tournament. We have got a very good balance of spin and pace, but we have to be at our best. It is great to have Ponting back and he looks in great touch. His form in the World Cups has been awesome and he will be crucial. I am looking forward to our first game. We have to play well and get a good win.Hello and Welcome to day 3 of the 2011 World Cup. It is time for the defending champions Australia to start their campaign as they take on Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad. The last time Australia lost a World Cup match was against Pakistan at Leeds 12 years ago. Since then, they have been on a 29 match winning streak and they will be looking to continue their unbeaten streak today. However, Zimbabwe are loaded with spinners and they will be looking to exploit the Aussie batsmen's weakness against spin. I am Sid V, and I will be bringing you all the action with Pradeep, Ganesh and Srivathsa.by Karthik LakshmananThe last time Australia lost a match in a World Cup was more than a decade back, in 1999. For a team that has won 29 consecutive World Cup games, a match against Zimbabwe should be a cakewalk. However, any minnow could pose a threat in a World Cup game, especially in the first game.Team NewsAustralia: Australia have had a roller-coaster build up to the World Cup. A Test whitewash in India followed by an Ashes drubbing at home saw people writing off the defending champions even before their ODI season had started. But a 6-1 thrashing over England in the CB series showed why the Aussies are ranked number 1 in the ICC ODI ratings. High on confidence, they arrived in India and started their warm ups almost perfectly - they bundled out the famed Indian batting line up for a paltry 214 and at one position were at 120-2. However, their old nemeses - spin and bounce - arrived to haunt them and they ended up losing 8 wickets for 56 runs. A similar story against South Africa in the next game ensured that the Aussies warmed up with 2 losses. Australia's toughest opponent in this World Cup will be their middle order's susceptibility to quality spin bowling - they have lost 13 wickets to spinners in the 2 warm up games played. With most teams having quality spinners in their line ups, the Australian batsmen will have to quickly find answers to their middle order woes.
Going against the trend on sub continental wickets, Australia have packed their squad with pacers and just one spinner in Jason Krezja. Just like their batting, the bowlers too have had a seesaw ride to the series. The quicks, led by the experienced Brett Lee, came good against India and managed to pick up 7 wickets between them. But the tables turned in the next game when they were walloped by the South Africans and all of them returned wicket less.
Amidst these inconsistencies stands Shane Watson. The all-rounder, who recently won the Allan Border medal, has been their go-to man throughout the season. His presence at the top of the order and the return of their skipper Ricky Ponting - to the squad and to form - will boost their confidence going into their first match.Zimbabwe: Although minnows, history suggests that Zimbabwe cannot be taken lightly during the World Cup. The Zimbabweans are a much improved side than the one they had 4 years back. They too, have had a bumpy build up to the series: they won the 2 warm up games in Dubai but lost both their games in India. In the first game, they had answers to the might of the South Africans and they conceded a thriller against Ireland in the next game. The African side would take heart from the form of their captain Chigumbura, who slammed an unbeaten ton against Ireland, and some of their top order batsmen. They have consistently managed to post scores of over 200 over the last year and an inspired performance by their capable batsmen could give them a chance of beating even the Aussies.
Having openly spoken about the Australians' weakness against spin, the Zimbabweans will look to pack their side with slow bowlers. A win against Australia is a tough ask, but not an impossible one for this improved side.Head to HeadAustralia lost the first ever game they played against Zimbabwe - in the World Cup in 1983 - and that remains the only game they have lost to them. The two teams have played 27 games against each other overall and Australia have won 25, with one game washed out.Quotes:"Our main strength is spin, so hopefully we can get it in the right areas and they might succumb to the same pressures that everyone else is under," - Zimbabwe coach Grant Flower.
"I don't really see the pressure to defend the World Cup because we are a very different team to what the team was in 2007," - Shane Watson.Teams:Australia (From): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, David Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Doug Bollinger, Shaun Tait, John Hastings, Tim Paine, Callum Ferguson, Jason KrejzaZimbabwe (From): Brendan Taylor, Charles Coventry, Regis Chakabva, Tatenda Taibu(w), Craig Ervine, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura(c), Prosper Utseya, Graeme Cremer, Ray Price, Chris Mpofu, Sean Ervine, Gregory Lamb, Shingirai Masakadza, Tinashe Panyangara, Terry DuffinLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
