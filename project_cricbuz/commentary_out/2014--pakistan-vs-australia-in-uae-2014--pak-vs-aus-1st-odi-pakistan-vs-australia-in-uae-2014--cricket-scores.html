They started off poorly, losing Finch off the first delivery of the game but Warner and Smith steadied things for them. Afridi provided the much-needed breakthrough as he got Warner on 43 but Smith continued to battle it out at the other end. Other batsmen could not give him support as the hosts kept losing wickets at regular intervals. It was a fine innings by Smith, a well-compiled maiden ton on a wicket that was not easy to bat on. Johnson played a wonderful cameo towards the end to push Australia past the 250 mark. Afridi was the pick of the bowlers as he took three important wickets. Irfan and the debutant Babar supported him well. Join us back for the chase in a short while...4

We have to forget what happend in the T20I. This is a new game, a different format and we will want to focus on that. Right now, we need to restrict them to a low total."George Bailey: "We will have a bat first. It looks like a beautiful wicket so hopefully, we will be able to put runs on the board. We have a debutant today so that is always exciting. Pakistan is a good opposition."Australia have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "All grass has been shaved off the pitch. You can see a slight sheen on the wicket. As the match progresses, the ball will be harder to hit. So, it is win the toss and bat first kind of a pitch," reckons Dean Jones.Sean Abbott is making his ODI debut for Australia. He gets his cap from Dean Jones.Sorry folks, you'll have to wait a bit longer. The match will begin at 3:00 pm local time i.e. 4:30 pm IST.Looks like there has been a problem with the match timings. We will bring you the revised timing as soon as we get a confirmation about the same.Will the hosts break the chain this time? Or will Australia put up yet another clinical performance? Hello and welcome to the first ODI between Pakistan and Australia being played at Sharjah. Toss and teams coming up in a few minutes. Stay tuned...Australia may be without their regular captain Michael Clarke, but George Bailey has already proved to be a shrewd skipper. Mitchell Johnson, who missed the T20I as he was recovering from a rib injury, is likely to be fit today. History is also on their side. Pakistan have not beaten Australia in an ODI series, since winning 2-1 Down Under in 2002. After that, the visitors have gone on to win three in a row, in 2009 (UAE), 2010 (Australia) and, 2012 (UAE).After a humiliating defeat in the one-off T20I, Pakistan will be looking forward to begin the 3-match ODI series againt Australia on a positive note. However, in the absence of Saeed Ajmal and the injured Mohammad Hafeez, it will not be an easy task. Their batting, especially, will be tested against a strong Australian bowling attack. With Misbah-ul-Haq's return as captain, the hosts will be hoping for a quick turnaround in their fortunes.PreviewPakistan and Australia will focus on spin when they start a three-match one-day series in Sharjah on Tuesday, despite the absence of top bowler Saeed Ajmal, who is suspended over his suspect bowling action. Pakistan have been hard pressed to compensate for the missing Ajmal, who has single-handedly won them matches in all three formats of the game in the last five years.He was reported for a suspect bowling action on Pakistan's August tour of Sri Lanka and was subsequently banned from international cricket after a bio-mechanic analysis found his action illegal.Skipper Misbah-ul Haq stressed Pakistan must move on."It's really difficult to fill Ajmal's gap because he has been the number one or two bowler in the one-day rankings, but if Ajmal is not there we must try to fill his gap and move forward," said Misbah on Monday.Pakistan have two left-arm spinners in the squad in Raza Hasan, who took 2-17 in Pakistan's six wicket defeat in the lone Twenty20 in Dubai on Sunday, and the experienced Zulfiqar Babar. Pakistan will also miss allrounder Mohammad Hafeez, who injured his hand on Saturday and will miss the limited over series.But Misbah conceded that Pakistan will have to put runs on the board after being restricted to 96-9 in the Twenty20 match, with Australian spinners Glenn Maxwell (3-13) and Cameron Boyce (2-10) causing trouble."I think the Australian batsmen have improved against spin by playing in the Indian league. If it's spinning and the bowler puts it in the right areas, then its difficult for everyone, its tough and at the same time you have to bat well against their spinners," said Misbah.Pakistan's batting will again be tested after their miserable show on the Sri Lankan tour where they lost the one-day series 2-1 and the Tests 2-0.Australia also are without their regular captain Michael Clarke who is facing a race against time to get fit from a hamstring injury for the two Tests which follow the one-dayers. Also out are allrounders Shane Watson (ankle) and Mitchell Marsh (hamstring).Skipper George Bailey said Pakistan will be tough even without Ajmal."There's no doubt he's been very important to Pakistan," said Bailey of Ajmal. "But Pakistan will be trying to prove they don't rely too much on him and it will pose different challenges (for us)."Bailey accepted it will be a challenge to counter the spin."I still think teams are doctoring their wickets when we come and play to produce very large spinning wickets, which says to me that teams still think that we're vulnerable against spin. The challenge for us is to become good against spin," Bailey said.Pakistan have not beaten Australia in a one-day series since winning 2-1 Down Under in 2002. Since then Australia have won three in a row in 2009 (UAE), 2010 (Australia) and 2012 (UAE).Teams:Australia (From): George Bailey(c), David Warner, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, Nathan Lyon, Sean Abbott, Phillip Hughes, Xavier DohertyPakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Ahmed Shehzad, Umar Akmal(w), Fawad Alam, Anwar Ali, Asad Shafiq, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Raza Hasan, Sarfraz Ahmed, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Umar Amin, Wahab RiazLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
