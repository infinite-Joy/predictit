Shapoor will open the attackWelcome back...Nabi and Shenwari have wrecked havoc at Kuala Lumpur. Two of them got together when the innings was in tatters at 124 for 4. The pair took their time to settle in and then started their assault. At one stage 300 looked far away but due to them they got there easily. Ghani and Noor Ali too played well as both of them notched up their fifties. The UAE bowlers did not start off well but the spinners pulled things back in the middle, just to lose it again in the death. It is going to take some getting by their batsmen if they have to chase this down. Join us in a short while for the run chase....4
