BANGLADESH:19.1 19.1Anwar Ali to Mahmudullah, FOUR, Mahmudullah whacks a full toss wide of long-on and takes off in celebration. He doesn't have long to do so as his teammates are all over him. Bangladesh are through to the final. What a match.Anwar Ali [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attackThe game is nearly done. 3 required off the final over. And Pakistan is not chasing them, which would've left some hope, but defending. Anwar Ali is assigned the task
BANGLADESH:18.6 Sami to Mahmudullah, 1 run, slower short ball on the stumps, Mahmudullah is early into the pull and toe-ends it towards deep mid-wicket
BANGLADESH:18.6 Sami to Mahmudullah, no ball, FOUR, I'm afraid Mohammad Sami will be banished in Bangladesh forever. I can't believe what's happening. Another no-ball, another free-hit on offer and the match is blown away. To make matters worse, Mahmudullah has sliced a near-yorker between backward point and short third man
BANGLADESH:18.5 Sami to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, that's running away to the fence. But long-off has run round to cut it off. Full ball around off, Mahmudullah spears it down and collects two
BANGLADESH:18.4 Sami to Mortaza, 1 run, wide yorker, Mortaza reaches out and slices it wide of backward point. What a ball on a free-hit. The fielder dives and keeps them to a single
BANGLADESH:18.4 Sami to Mortaza, no ball, 2 runs, the crowd is in raptures, you'd think they've gone mad after Mortaza is caught at long-off. But look again. Closely. And you'd find the umpire's right arm stretched. It's a god-forsaken "no-ball". You're kidding me Mohammad Sami. Good ball again, very full and Mortaza holes out. But he's committed a monstrous crime. On top of that, the throw from long-off is sky-kissing. It's like he was so miffed with the no-ball that he decided "I'm done". Or maybe he just flung it in the air in celebration, which is more likely
BANGLADESH:18.3 Sami to Mahmudullah, 1 run, woosh, lovely stuff. A jabbing yorker on middle, Mahmudullah rushes to get his feet out of the way and squeezes it through the covers
BANGLADESH:18.2 Sami to Mortaza, 1 run, jeez, Mortaza was very late on it. Speared in full just outside off, Mortaza swats it off the bottom of the bat down to long-off. There was no chance of getting any elevation as his bat barely made it down
BANGLADESH:18.1 Sami to Mahmudullah, 1 run, slips in a very full and brisk ball on middle, a hint of tail on it, Mahmudullah whips it down to long-onMohammad Sami [3.0-0-15-0] is back into the attackAfridi has a big chat with Sami. An animated one. The type which battle commanders have before heading to war. It's still Bangladesh's game to lose. 18 in 12 with 5 wickets in hand.
BANGLADESH:17.6 Amir to Mortaza, no run, and again. Amir kicks the turf in frustration. A wicket is what he wanted. Fuller length and searing away wide of off, out of Mortaza's reach as he wafts
BANGLADESH:17.5 Amir to Mortaza, no run, angled away wide of off from over the wicket, Mortaza swishes and misses. Some pace this. 149ks
BANGLADESH:17.4 Amir to Mortaza, FOUR, the stadium will erupt if it doesn't behave itself. But who can blame them. Mortaza has set this ground afire. Two boundaries from two. Short ball menacingly directed towards the rib-cage, Mortaza half-ducks, sees he can't get out of the way and then commits to a half-hearted pull. Gets big on him and soars away off the splice over short fine
BANGLADESH:17.3 Amir to Mortaza, FOUR, that's gone away right under the fielder's dive. Full and fast on off, 150 clicks, Mortaza clears the front leg and drives it to the right of mid-off. Sami dives over the ball and lets it throughMashrafe Mortaza, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:17.2 Amir to Shakib, out Bowled!! Shakib is absolutely furious here. Lucky he has a bat in hand and not a sword. Swings at the broken carcass of the timber. Then puts his hand up as an apology to the umpire. Walked across looking to play the lap shot but chose the absolute worst ball to do so. Amir darted in a full ball on leg-stump and took it down. Shakib b Amir 8(13)Amir to Shakib, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
BANGLADESH:17.1 Amir to Shakib, no run, ufff! Try getting that away. Fires in a blasting yorker which keeps bending towards Shakib's toes. Shakib just about gets his bat down in time and chops it onto padMohammad Amir [3.0-0-18-1] is back into the attackI have never seen the entire team gathering for a quick meeting. It's usually just 3-4 players, the senior ones whom the captain relies for advise. This is unprecedented and has resulted in Amir getting the ball for his final over. Bangladesh are 26 away. They have 3 overs to get them in..
BANGLADESH:16.6 Irfan to Mahmudullah, no run, zipping off from a back of a length outside off, bounces over Mahmudullah's dangling bat
BANGLADESH:16.5 Irfan to Shakib, leg byes, 1 run, walks across trying to scoop but is hit on the pad, drops it on the popping crease and they decide to go through. Mahmudullah dives full stretch to beat Irfan's sprint-and-flick
BANGLADESH:16.4 Irfan to Mahmudullah, 1 run, scorched to deep cover. Short and wide and Mahmudullah destroys it off the back foot. Would have hit far worse shots than that and got more rewards
BANGLADESH:16.3 Irfan to Mahmudullah, no run, changes the angle of attack and shortens the length further towards the chest, Mahmudullah fends it safely into the off-side
BANGLADESH:16.2 Irfan to Mahmudullah, SIX, oh boy! Mahmadullah adds one to the list of his accomplishments. Back of a length ball just outside off, clears the front leg and blazes it over mid-off. Words can't describe how good a shot that is. Keep in mind the bounce Irfan generates. Breathtaking!
BANGLADESH:16.1 Irfan to Shakib, 1 run, jumps from a back of a length outside off, Shakib rolls his wrists on the ball and dabs it down to third manMohammad Irfan [3.0-0-15-1] is back into the attackHere comes the towering Mohammad Irfan. Afridi senses this is the point to strike. Rather than holding his one over for later, he's bowling him out. 35 needed from 24.
BANGLADESH:15.6 Sami to Mahmudullah, no run, a clear inside edge onto pad snuffs out the appeal prematurely. Length ball which catches Mahmudullah on the crease trying to defend on off, lucky to chop it onto pad
BANGLADESH:15.5 Sami to Shakib, 1 run, another similarly shortish ball outside off, Shakib plays this even later. Way behind his body. Cuts it down to third man
BANGLADESH:15.4 Sami to Shakib, 2 runs, oh poor Mohammad Irfan. For him to bend and field a ball near the bootlaces is such a task. Does well though. Shortish just outside off, Shakib creates his own room and late-cuts it behind backward point to set Irfan on an unwanted sprint
BANGLADESH:15.3 Sami to Mahmudullah, 1 run, the crowd is getting slightly restless here. A stroll is being converted into a crawl it seems. Length ball just outside off, patted from the crease in front of cover for a quick run
BANGLADESH:15.2 Sami to Shakib, 1 run, backs away a long way and drives a length ball from middle to deep cover. He's really struggling
BANGLADESH:15.1 Sami to Shakib, no run, that's sheer hope from Shakib. Almost like he premeditated the cut even as Sami was running in. The line is too close to off and the length isn't short enough. He's late on the stroke and missesMohammad Sami [2.0-0-10-0] is back into the attack
BANGLADESH:14.6 Shoaib Malik to Mahmudullah, no run, flatter and kicks off from a length, turned a bit as well to foil Mahmudullah's plans of steering it into the off-side. Hit him on the bat-handle I think before rolling away into the on-side
BANGLADESH:14.5 Shoaib Malik to Mahmudullah, no run, quicker and fuller, drifting across off with the arm, nudged back down the pitch
BANGLADESH:14.4 Shoaib Malik to Shakib, 1 run, tossed up and sliding on towards off, Shakib leans into the push and hits it nicely down to long-off
BANGLADESH:14.3 Shoaib Malik to Mahmudullah, 1 run, flatter on leg, glanced in front of short fineMahmudullah, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:14.2 Shoaib Malik to Rahim, out Lbw!! "Huh?" That's not just my reaction. The whole Shere Bangla concurs with me. How can that be out? How? Fired in from round the wicket, beats Rahim on his reverse sweep and hits the pad. But surely that's pitched outside leg. Lets wait for replays before making such calls. Oh yes, it's pitched outside leg. And even going over the top of the stumps according to HawkEye. Rahim lbw b Shoaib Malik 12(15)Shoaib Malik to Rahim, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
BANGLADESH:14.1 Shoaib Malik to Shakib, 1 run, darted into the pads from round the wicket, nudged towards square legShoaib Malik, right-arm off break, comes into the attackBangladesh need only keep their heads here and a place in the final is theirs..
BANGLADESH:13.6 Amir to Rahim, 2 runs, pounds it in on a short of length from round the wicket, the angle takes it towards Rahim's rib-cage and he avoids some bad bruises with a gentle clip wide of long-on. Easy two before the fielder takes his jolly old time to field
BANGLADESH:13.5 Amir to Shakib, 1 run, skids on from a back of a length only to be stabbed behind backward point down towards third man
BANGLADESH:13.5 Amir to Shakib, wide, tried to surprise the batsman with a bumper but got the line wrong. Falls away down leg and allows Shakib to move inside the line
BANGLADESH:13.4 Amir to Shakib, no run, Shakib moves half-forward and dinks this length ball into the off-side
BANGLADESH:13.3 Amir to Shakib, no run, fullish just outside off, driven softly to coverShakib Al Hasan, left handed bat, comes to the creaseA widish slip in place now for the new man..
BANGLADESH:13.2 Amir to Soumya Sarkar, out Bowled!! Kaboom! There's a Mohammad Amir special. Runs in and cannons one into the blockhole to go right through Sarkar's defences. Thoroughly beaten for pace and didn't get the bat down in time. The leg-stump is planted on the turf wearing the face of a boxer with a black eye. Amir swings his arms in delight and Pakistan are still alive here. Soumya Sarkar b Amir 48(48) [4s-5 6s-1]Amir to Soumya Sarkar, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
BANGLADESH:13.1 Amir to Rahim, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, steered wide of backward point where Akmal dives and gets a hand to make a half-stopMohammad Amir [2.0-0-13-0] is back into the attack
BANGLADESH:12.6 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, no run, quicker googly on off, chopped towards where a slip would be
BANGLADESH:12.5 Afridi to Rahim, 1 run, Afridi is convinced that the LBW is on. The umpire has doused that fire quickly enough. And what a top call. Rahim had top-edged the sweep into his torso and towards short third man
BANGLADESH:12.4 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, leg byes, 1 run, fired in on the pads, Sarkar is late on the flick and the ball deflects behind square
BANGLADESH:12.3 Afridi to Rahim, 1 run, "catch it" is the cry, but Afridi's hands aren't quite long enough to reach out. Drifting in with the arm on middle and leg, Rahim swats it off the inside half of the bat as he was trying to go inside-out and lucky to get it down to long-on
BANGLADESH:12.2 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, ah, Sarkar is nearly drawn into an ill-advised swish, had to reach out as the length wasn't there and mistimes it along the ground through square leg
BANGLADESH:12.1 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, no run, slips in a googly on leg-stump, Sarkar is patient enough, reads it and pats it into the off-side
BANGLADESH:11.6 Sami to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, slips in a brisk short of length delivery, gets it to rise around chest high, and hurries Sarkar in his pull. It hits him high on the bat and rolls away wide of mid-wicket
BANGLADESH:11.5 Sami to Rahim, 1 run, slightly streaky but Rahim controlled it well in the end. Initially tried to work it through the on-side, realized the line is outside off, then made sure he didn't close the bat-face completely. Runs away off the outside half in front of mid-off
BANGLADESH:11.4 Sami to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, nicely done. This is more advisable rather than going all hooohaaa. Steered down to third man with the right armer's angle
BANGLADESH:11.3 Sami to Rahim, 1 run, gently back of a length delivery outside off, Rahim plants an open-face and skims it down to third manAfridi can't stop maneuvering the field at the moment. And wiping the sweat beads off his forehead..
BANGLADESH:11.2 Sami to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, back of a length delivery skidding on just outside off, Sarkar stays leg-side and dabs it down to third man
BANGLADESH:11.1 Sami to Soumya Sarkar, no run, ooooh, Sarkar is just going with the adrenaline rush. Backs away to a length ball looking to hoist it over extra-cover. The angle was always leaving him and he fails to connect. Didn't miss off-stump by a big wayMohammad Sami [1.0-0-5-0] is back into the attack
BANGLADESH:10.6 Afridi to Rahim, no run, slightly short outside off, quick too, Rahim plays the late-cut well but can't get it past short third man
BANGLADESH:10.5 Afridi to Rahim, 2 runs, oh ridiculous. Khurram Manzoor has added to Pakistan's frustration in a big way. Played with the turn to sweeper cover, Manzoor had no excuse really for firing such a wild throw. The keeper had no chance with it. An extra run leaked
BANGLADESH:10.4 Afridi to Rahim, no run, flatter outside off, pushed with the turn to cover
BANGLADESH:10.3 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, and sloppiness has found its way into the Pakistani outfit. Driven gently to short cover where Hafeez lets it slip through
BANGLADESH:10.2 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, Sarkar is running away here. And the bowling is helping his cause. Tossed up nicely but its down the leg-side, Sarkar sits on his back knee and wallops the sweep behind square
BANGLADESH:10.1 Afridi to Rahim, 1 run, drifting in with the arm just outside off, Rahim waits on the crease and dabs it softly in front of short third ma
BANGLADESH:9.6 Anwar Ali to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, top shot! Length ball has been murdered across the line. Stays put and clubs it over mid-wicket. Not even an iota of intention to keep it down. Bullets away to the ropes and the half-way mark is reached. Bangladesh very much in..
BANGLADESH:9.6 Anwar Ali to Soumya Sarkar, wide, that's the last thing I was hoping. Low full toss mediocred with a line down leg, Sarkar turns to tickle but missesThe crowd is absolutely buzzing! Pakistan need a wicket. Afridi runs in again
BANGLADESH:9.5 Anwar Ali to Soumya Sarkar, 2 runs, backs away, lets this short of length delivery come onto him and mows it over mid-wicket for a brace
BANGLADESH:9.4 Anwar Ali to Rahim, 1 run, the width on this has been crashed away to square third man. Only a single and the Pakistani fielding is doing well to compensate for the batting mess
BANGLADESH:9.3 Anwar Ali to Rahim, no run, dabbed to the left of backward point who dives and saves some runs
BANGLADESH:9.2 Anwar Ali to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, channels all his frustration into a bumper outside off, Sarkar puts on his jet pack and hops. Upper cuts it over the infield and the sweeper tidies up to keep it to a single
BANGLADESH:9.1 Anwar Ali to Soumya Sarkar, SIX, that ball has been martyred! Skips out of the pitch and flicks it brutally over mid-wicket. A swing off the arms and the ball flies away
BANGLADESH:8.6 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, shot! Reverses his bat and mocks Afridi with a reverse-sweep. Off the middle but couldn't find a plughole in the field. To deep backward point where Umar Akmal dives and saves a certain boundary. Sarkar slipped while trying to return after being sent back. He was halfway down the pitch. A throw to the bowler's end could have seen a run-out! All happening
BANGLADESH:8.5 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, 2 runs, looks to drive it with flat feet and the outside edge runs uppishly to deep backward point. A late throw means that a quick brace was on. Easily done
BANGLADESH:8.4 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, no run, a googly that showed its cards way before than it should have. Dragged down, Sarkar still cannot read it and ends up jamming it into the pitch
BANGLADESH:8.3 Afridi to Rahim, 1 run, stays put and punches the ball to long-off for a single
BANGLADESH:8.2 Afridi to Rahim, no run, turn outside off as Afridi loops this a touch, Rahim is beaten on the forward defenceMushfiqur Rahim, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:8.1 Afridi to S Rahman, out Bowled!! And Afridi stands with his legs apart and his arms stretched wide. The quicker googly on the stumps, 101ks. Pitches and skids off at pace. Rahman was amidst his dance out of the crease, is beaten on the inside edge and the ball sneaks through the bat-pad gap to take the middle-leg bail. S Rahman b Afridi 14(15) [4s-1]Afridi to S Rahman, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Bangladesh need 84 runs in 72 balls. Very doable with 9 wickets in hand. Stay tuned because T20s aren't short of twists and turns..
BANGLADESH:7.6 Anwar Ali to S Rahman, 1 run, throws all his power into this hoick whilst fetching the ball from outside off. Dragged into the pitch and a single is effected as the ball rolls away to square leg
BANGLADESH:7.5 Anwar Ali to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, the fuller length saga trudges on. Sarkar this times forces the drive through cover and jogs to the other end
BANGLADESH:7.4 Anwar Ali to Soumya Sarkar, no run, full and on the pads, tamely tucked to mid-wicket
BANGLADESH:7.3 Anwar Ali to Soumya Sarkar, no run, stays tall and punches this to one of the off-ring guarders
BANGLADESH:7.2 Anwar Ali to S Rahman, 3 runs, that was out of reach of mid-off's sprint but what an effort! Watch it when you're short of motivation. Rahman had toe-ended the loft, an urgent Sami runs back and across, extends his arms but the ball was always going away. Couldn't get up as he slips, hurls a throw back to invite a third umpire referral but Soumya Sarkar was back at the striker's endContinues over the wicket
BANGLADESH:7.1 Anwar Ali to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, pitches this on a fuller length on middle, helped to long-on employing some wristworkAnwar Ali, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
BANGLADESH:6.6 Afridi to S Rahman, no run, googly that cramps the batsman. Line's within the stumps and Rahman can only block it back
BANGLADESH:6.5 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, a bit of loop, Sarkar gets low on his knees and sweeps. Off the middle but deep mid-wicket intercepts and keeps it to a single
BANGLADESH:6.4 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, no run, goes back and punches this googly back to Afridi
BANGLADESH:6.3 Afridi to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, horrow down leg, Sarkar squats and sweeps it through fine leg
BANGLADESH:6.2 Afridi to S Rahman, leg byes, 1 run, ambitious, like my Sunday morning alarm. The googly that misses Rahman's defence and hits him on the pad. Well outside off and the umpire shakes his head while smiling
BANGLADESH:6.1 Afridi to S Rahman, no run, quicker delivery outside off, Rahman is cramped for the cut and chops it square of the wicketShahid Afridi, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackBoom Boom with the ball. Looks tense. No slip
BANGLADESH:5.6 Irfan to S Rahman, 1 run, length ball wide, Rahman protracts his arms to glide it down to third man. That's the powerplay done. A frugal 34 runs but they are right on track. Not running but this target allows you to jog and still win the marathon
BANGLADESH:5.5 Irfan to S Rahman, no run, a venomous short ball and Rahman was looking to pull it. Hook it rather. Sees it rising, holds his bat high and duck-sways to safer shores
BANGLADESH:5.4 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, this ball ducks in and Sarkar was already in his bat-swing routine. Ekes out an inside edge as he looked to go big over leg-side and the ball takes the back thigh. Could have gone anywhere. Try thinking "stumps"
BANGLADESH:5.3 Irfan to S Rahman, 1 run, back of a length delivery and Rahman was waiting on the back foot. Mistimes the clobber to deep mid wicket but a cheap single is still available. Oh T20s!
BANGLADESH:5.2 Irfan to S Rahman, no run, loud appeal from Irfan but a muted Sarfraz could have been more convincing. Back of a length delivery that nearly shaves the bat face as Rahman looked to run it down to third man. No sound and it just missed. Good decision
BANGLADESH:5.1 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, how often do you see someone pulling Irfan? The line down leg helped, Sarkar rocked back in a jiffy, hauled his front leg in air and helped it with a pull to backward square legYou'd reckon that this is a sedate T20 start but a lookback at Pakistan's start will let you know about the pitch and the batting on show today
BANGLADESH:4.6 Sami to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, length ball zooting off the pitch, Sarkar was looking to run it down to third man. Gets an intended single but it's off the splice
BANGLADESH:4.5 Sami to Soumya Sarkar, no run, gets behind this length ball that looked off-pace again, waits a bit more and then defends it
BANGLADESH:4.4 Sami to Soumya Sarkar, no run, and the Dhaka pitch gets back to normalcy. Off-cutter that embraces the pitch, Sarkar's punch goes airy and just in front of an on-rushing short cover. Close, close shave that
BANGLADESH:4.3 Sami to Soumya Sarkar, no run, gets the width to straighten elbows, flashes the cut but chops it square.
BANGLADESH:4.2 Sami to S Rahman, leg byes, 1 run, another straight ball skidded off the pitch with a nip in. Rahman was on his toes to tuck, missed and was rapped on the pads. Appeal denied and that was clipping leg-stump, says the HawkEye
BANGLADESH:4.1 Sami to S Rahman, FOUR, and the claps are back. Length ball on leg-stump alright but that was crunched. Everything is from Rahman these days. Stands tall, turns around and clips it to fine legMohammad Sami, right-arm fast, comes into the attack
BANGLADESH:3.6 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, no run, that was a close shave. Had his bat face open to greet the ball, Irfan hurled it in with the angle and Sarkar's steer periliously evaded the stumps. In front of slip who tidies up and denies any run
BANGLADESH:3.5 Irfan to S Rahman, 1 run, Bangladesh are doing what Pakistan couldn't. Quick singles. Clips this middle-stump delivery to mid-on and runs through urgently
BANGLADESH:3.4 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, opens the face of the bat and steers this to third man for a single
BANGLADESH:3.3 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, no run, this time gets outside the line of this shortish delivery and helps it with a pull to short fine. Almost carried. Still off the top of the bat and hence no single on offer
BANGLADESH:3.2 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, no run, shortish ball cramping the batsman for room, Sarkar was halfway in his turn and short-arm pulled it to mid-on rather awkwardly. The fielder rifles the throw at the bowler's end but Sarkar was in
BANGLADESH:3.1 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, no run, length and skipping off the pitch. At a height more than Sarkar anticipated and the ball zooms over his attempted cut
BANGLADESH:2.6 Amir to S Rahman, no run, lovely wood-leather sound as Rahman blocked this wide length ball to point
BANGLADESH:2.5 Amir to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, gets this length ball to bound off the pitch, Sarkar adjusts and splices the punch square of the wicket. Third man runs across and cuts it offThat pull shot has said goodbye to one of the slips
BANGLADESH:2.4 Amir to Soumya Sarkar, no run, fullish ball that pushes Sarkar back, Sarkar bends low and defends it under his eyes
BANGLADESH:2.3 Amir to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, that's dismissed. No ducking under the bouncer. Short ball and sitting up to be fair but Sarkar stood tall and picks it up with a pull. Clouts it over mid-wicket and the ball just runs away
BANGLADESH:2.2 Amir to Soumya Sarkar, no run, shuffles across leg and then open-bats the punch to backward point. Not even half a run there
BANGLADESH:2.1 Amir to Soumya Sarkar, no run, cut into two. Stayed glued to the crease and looked to nonchalantly flay the drive, as if it's easy against Amir. The ball cuts in and gets inside the bat swing
BANGLADESH:1.6 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, back of a length delivery rising up, on leg-stump and Sarkar turns around to fend it off one hand. Keeps it down and steals a single to fine leg
BANGLADESH:1.5 Irfan to S Rahman, 3 runs, and he times it straightaway. Bends low and then tucks it through mid-wicket. A sliding stop and some tag-team work to stop the boundary in the deepSabbir Rahman, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:1.4 Irfan to Tamim, out Lbw!! And the crowd is on sleeping pills again. Fullish delivery that nips in, Tamim was caught in the crease looking to tuck it round the corner, gets hit on the pad. A formal appeal and that was potentially going onto to peg the stumps back. That was hitting the middle, says HawkEye. Tamim lbw b Irfan 7(4) [6s-1]Irfan to Tamim, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
BANGLADESH:1.3 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, what these boundaries have done is that these shots not only have timing but thousands of cheering throats behind them too. This veering in delivery is ticked to fine leg for a single
BANGLADESH:1.2 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, short and wide and crying to be hit. Sarkar stands tall and cuts it way to the left of backward point. Vrooms away
BANGLADESH:1.1 Irfan to Soumya Sarkar, no run, full ball, Sarkar gets an inside-edge as the ball curls in. Onto the pad to invite half an appealMohammad Irfan, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
BANGLADESH:0.6 Amir to Tamim, SIX, that's a pick-up shot you play to render the bowler quiet. Full and Tamim flicks it uppishly. Times it like a Japanese bullet train and gets it to sail over the backward square leg fence
BANGLADESH:0.5 Amir to Tamim, no run, an appeal so loud that it could send you to the same doctor as Van Gogh. Length ball zooming in, Tamim was looking to tuck it into the leg-side after stepping out, the ball straightens a touch while ripping off the pitch. Loud appeal but that was bat hitting the pad
BANGLADESH:0.4 Amir to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, opens the face of the bat this time. A half-deliberate single as he manages to get it off the outer half
BANGLADESH:0.3 Amir to Soumya Sarkar, no run, there's the customary Amir peach. Angles it in and gets it to swing away late. Sarkar is opened up a touch as he sees the ball zoot across the outside edge. Beaten and a half
BANGLADESH:0.2 Amir to Soumya Sarkar, no run, length ball swerving out late, Sarkar lifts his bat and lets it go
BANGLADESH:0.1 Amir to Tamim, 1 run, full and curling in from over the wicket, the batsman gets forward and clips it to mid-wicket for a single to get off the markTamim and Soumya Sarkar are at the crease. Tamim is on strike. Amir will open the attackCamera pans on a hyperactive Afridi arranging his field. The Bangladeshi openers follow to rather subtle cheers from the crowd. Most of them are perhaps out to fetch dinner. Amir has the ball as the countdown with a mouth fills my screen..Two slipsSo, the Asia Cup Express, having itself being promoted from passenger ODIs to express T20s wheels on. Bangladesh have a chance to upgrade their ticket and confirm a berth in the finale. Can they manage to evade the nerve-maze and hop on to the seat next to India? Their recent history in hunting totals says otherwise. Can be a task against Pakistan looking to defend employing their superlative skill.After the start that they had, Pakistan will be delighted to at least have a score which they can fight with. Malik continues to prove his worth in the middle, as he once again came into bat with the innings in tatters and then absorbed all the pressure. He found good support in Sarfraz and the duo went about steadily before turning it on in the later stages. That 70-run partnership off just 50 balls has given Pakistan some hope of staying alive in the competition. Sarfraz went on to complete a cracking half-century and remained undefeated. Bangladesh were brilliant with the new ball deflating the opposition to 28/4. But the intensity slightly fell off as the game went along. Now it's up to their batsmen to hold their nerve and book their berth in the final alongside India..1
PAKISTAN:19.6 Al-Amin to Anwar Ali, out Caught by S Rahman!! Just like many of his colleagues, Anwar Ali hits a full toss straight to the fielder. It was outside off and Anwar Ali went deep inside the crease, had a big mow at it and Sabbir Rahman has been kept busy there all day. Right under his throat and it was his third catch of the match. Good to see some fight from Pakistan in the last 10 overs. REMINDER: Bangladesh have lost all their previous 3 T20 games chasing. Anwar Ali c S Rahman b Al-Amin 13(9) [4s-1]Al-Amin to Anwar Ali, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:19.5 Al-Amin to Anwar Ali, 2 runs, fired full around off and Anwar Ali repeats the same shot, drilled through mid-wicket and boy! That was some running between the wickets
PAKISTAN:19.4 Al-Amin to Anwar Ali, 2 runs, low full toss just outside off, Anwar Ali gets across and goes for a cross-batted smite, a double to deep mid-wicket

PAKISTAN:18.6 Taskin Ahmed to Sarfraz, FOUR, well played Sarfraz Ahmed! Fifty for him. Take a bow! This is what he wanted to do on the third ball of this over.

Floated it up just outside off and Malik fetches the slog-sweep from there. Ekes out a thick top-edge and Sabbir Rahman settles under a sitter at deep mid-wicket. He lost his shape a bit as he was playing across the line and Sabbir Rahman's catch was a smart one. Had to wait for the ball and remember it was coming right under the dark sky.

PAKISTAN:11.2 Shakib to Sarfraz, no run, did he catch it? Oh, no! Just short of a desperate diving Mushfiqur Rahim. It was nicely tossed up around off and middle, Sarfraz shimmies down the pitch and he didn't have enough room to play the stroke he wanted. Tried to clip that through the leg-side maybe. Gets a bit of inside edge onto pad which lobs right in front of him. The keeper runs forward and dives full length but the ball died down way too early

PAKISTAN:4.5 Mortaza to Hafeez, out Lbw!! The Professor departs! Pakistan in big, big trouble. He cannot believe he has been given out. Hafeez wears a wry smile as he walks back. Was it too high? Looked so. But the umpire does not think so, the ball came in a lot and Hafeez was caught in the crease as he tried to tuck it into the on-side, missed it and the umpire's finger sinks his hopes. Replays show it was going over, so another poor decision in this tournament. Hafeez was struck on the back thigh and had a wry smile on his face when the umpire raised the finger. No dissent shown and that is good to see. Hafeez lbw b Mortaza 2(11)Mortaza to Hafeez, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!

PAKISTAN:3.5 A Sunny to Sharjeel Khan, out Bowled!! Bringing a spinner early on in the innings has done the trick for Bangladesh.

Tossed up delivery and Sharjeel slogged across the line, missed it completely and it crashed onto the middle stump. Pakistan in a bit of pickle now.

The keeper went for a big appeal and the bowler joined in, umpire took his time and raised his finger to send Manzoor back. The umpires check for a no-ball for Al-Amin's front foot was fine.

Here we go...Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mohammad Mithun, Sabbir Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Taskin Ahmed, Arafat Sunny, Al-Amin HossainPakistan (Playing XI): Sharjeel Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Khurram Manzoor, Shoaib Malik, Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi(c), Anwar Ali, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Sami, Mohammad IrfanMashrafe Mortaza: "We would have liked to bat but we cannot do anything about toss. Two changes today, Tamim Iqbal comes back in place of Nurul Hasan. Mustafizur is out, Arafat Sunny comes in."Shahid Afridi: "We will bat. It looks like a better track. Obviously, it is an important game for us. We know where we are standing in the competition. We all are positive and it is a good sign for me. Anwar Ali comes in place of Mohammad Nawaz."Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batPitch report: "There is no grass on the pitch. The grass has been cut right back down. The pitch will suit the batsmen, a score of 160 or above will be a reasonable total," reckons Dean Jones.While Bangladesh have plenty to work on in their batting, the same can be said of Pakistan as well. Against UAE, Pakistan were on 17/3, after losing their top three, before Umar Akmal and Shoaib Malik paddled them back to safer shores with sensible batting. Mohammad Amir has been in tremendous form in the Asia Cup so far. His fiery spell against India in their first match ensured that Pakistan made a match of a small total. Amir bowled exceptionally well in the match against UAE too. Mohammad Hafeez needs to play with authority and if he gets going, half the pressure will be released right away. Afridi was insipid with his captaincy against UAE with regard to his bowling changes and his field placements. Pakistan need a victory to keep their final hopes against India alive, and if they end up beating Bangladesh, it will all come down to the final league stage match between the Afridi-led side and Sri Lanka. Toss and team details to follow shortly...The stage is nicely set up for Bangladesh.They will be desperate for a win and will know that a victory here would catapult them into the final. The Tigers are dealing with a huge blow, with Mustafizur Rahman, their best bowler, out of the Asia Cup due to an injury. However, they will be bolstered by the return of Tamim Iqbal to the squad, considering the home team have struggled at the top of the batting order. Sabbir Rahman's fantastic run of form has papered over cracks in the middle order. Shakib Al Hasan has been struggling to put bat on ball in recent times and this is costing the team. The likes of Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim need to settle in before they play their shots.You can bet your bottom dollar that the crowd will turn up in huge numbers to belt out their encouragement for the home side.Hello and welcome to another evening of the Asia Cup. In what is bound to be a fascinating contest between the hosts Bangladesh and Pakistan, where the stakes will be sky-high. Batsmen have struggled to find their feet throughout the tournament. Even the ones who did, showed that one needs to bide time at the crease, see off the threat in the powerplay before playing the shots. That has been the batting formula that has worked so far.Preview by Ganesh ChandrasekaranWith wins in their previous games both Bangladesh and Pakistan must be fairly confident going into the 8th Match of the Asia Cup 2016, on Wednesday (March 2).Bangladesh though will miss the services of the in-form Mustafizur Rahman in the crucial tie. The left-arm seamer sustained a side strain and Tamim Iqbal has been named as the replacement. While that will bolster their batting-unit, Mustafizur was one of the leading bowlers in the tournament. His absence will severely dent the hosts, particularly on pitches such as the ones found in Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur for this tournament.Pakistan, after a lacklustre show against India, bounced back against UAE. Although there were some concerns still regarding their top-order. Waqar Younis, Pakistan head coach, had conceded that it was a spot of bother. But the good form of Mohammad Amir has meant that the bowling unit looks far more potent. The pace-group consisting of Amir, Mohammad Irfan and Mohammad Sami are likely to feature once again against Bangladesh.However, Pakistan's spin attack doesn't quite possess the same teeth. Shahid Afridi looked far from threatening in the two games, and it is his form that will concern Pakistan a bit. Left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz failed to make an impact on debut and could well be replaced by Imad Wasim. If Afridi finds his mojo again, it gives a well-rounded look to the attack and his form will be crucial for Pakistan, not only in this game but even in the ICC World Twenty20 that follows.Bangladesh will welcome the return of Tamim Iqbal who is coming back from a paternity leave. It will lease their batting issues a touch. They too, like Pakistan, have faced problems with lack of runs from their top order. Sabbir Rahman played a gem against Sri Lanka while Shakib Al Hasan also got to spend some time in the middle. The latter in particular will have to fire soon if Bangladesh are to make an impact in T20Is.The win against Sri Lanka puts them in good stead to up the ante against Pakistan. That win, notwithstanding, Bangladesh have done well against Pakistan in recent times. So much so that they might even claim to have a psychological edge over them. Only last year, they managed a clean-sweep against Pakistan in the limited over-series, winning all three One-Day Internationals, and the lone T20I.Those losses will be fresh in the minds of Pakistan, as much as it will be for the hosts. For Afridi's men, the maturity shown by Shoaib Malik and Umar Akmal against UAE was a definite improvement from their spectacular collapse against India. If the top order starts firing as well, they will be a hard team to beat in any condition, given their bowling attack.The man in focus will once again be Amir. After a three-wicket burst in the first game against India, he turned out a miserly spell against UAE, conceding only six runs in his four overs. He's quickly transforming into the lead strike-bowler of this Pakistan team. The ball has tended to do a bit at the start of the innings and Bangladesh will be wary of him, in particular. If they can play him out with little damage, then there is a chance to exploit Pakistan's spin-attack.After the first few games, the tracks in Mirpur have started to lose their shades of green. There has even been enough assistance for the spinners in the last couple of games. This will also mean that both teams will be looking at spin as a strike-force once again. Bangladesh might pip for a spinner to replace Mustafizur instead of a four-pronged pace attack.It will be a crucial tie for both teams as the race to the final heats up. With India assuring their spot in the final, the scenario becomes clear for Bangladesh.
