Ongondo will open the attackWelcome back to the Sri Lankan chase, 143 to chase off 50 overs, we might well have an early finish on cardsIt seemed that the sole objective of Kenya coming into this match was to play out their stipulated quota of 50 overs, they were almost successful in doing so until all was undone by Malinga. It was yet another horror start though as they were reduced to 8/2. Kenya showed that they had not learnt from the NZ game as they made wrong reviews on those two dismissals. The two Obuyas then set up a batting display that showed the Kenyan intent.The 94 run third wkt partnership was not pretty to watch but it helped Kenya gain some respectability. The fact that the two brothers outdid each other in scoring the slowest half-century showed the grip that the bowlers had on the two batsmen. Kenyan resistence though was blown away by the seemingly unplayable yorkers delivered from Malinga who took a 2nd hat-trick in WC matches on his way of splendid figures of 6/38 as they collapsed from 2/102 to 142 all-out. Malinga recorded his best ever figures in an ODI match. The fact that only Extras reached double figures other than the Obuya brothers tells the sorry plight of the Kenyans.Malinga has wiped out the Kenyan batting! It's been a scintillating display of fast bowling from him, he takes the white ball and leads his team. Join us at 6:35 PM IST for the remainder of the game as me (Ajith) and my colleagues take a breather.4
KENYA:43.4  Malinga to Otieno, out Bowled!! Another man who has been Malinga-ed.

He took a wicket in the last ball of the previous over.
KENYA:43.1  Malinga to Ongondo, out Bowled!! Yes, Malinga does it again! This is unbelievable stuff. That's been the best yorker of the lot according to me, a top order batsman would have struggled to pick that, and Ongondo is no new, it was pacy, fiery, he could not get his bat down in time, the ball crashed onto the stumps. Wicket No. 4 for Malinga, all four wickets from yorkers. Ongondo b Malinga 0(1) Malinga to Ongondo, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Do we get to see another yorker?

KENYA:41.6  Malinga to Mishra, out Lbw!! The review goes in the favour of Malinga, much to the delight of the crowd! He should thank heavens though, it was a fiery, unplayable yorker, but however, Malinga's foot was on the line as he bowled that, he got the benefit of the doubt from the third umpire, and hawk eye confirmed that the ball was going on to clip the leg stump, Mishra departs for a duck after facing 13 deliveries! Mishra lbw b Malinga 0(13) Malinga to Mishra, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Oh my my! Malinga's foot is on the line, touch and go. Will it be a no-ball? Or is it sliding down the leg too?

KENYA:41.1  Malinga to Kamande, out Kamande Run Out!! That was a pretty easy decision for the third umpire! A crushing yorker from Malinga, looks like Kamande got some bat to that one as he tried to dig it to the on side, he was a goner otherwise, Malinga appeals and Kamande tries to sneak a single, Chamara Silva comes running in from short mid wicket and under arms it to the stumps, the ball was right next to the stumps and Kamande decided to go for a horror run, invites death and pays the price! Kamande run out (Silva) 1(3) Malinga to Kamande, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!A perfect yorker to start the over, LBW turned down, but is Kamande run out? The third umpire called, looks gone!Slinga Malinga is back into the attack

Malinga is back for Perera and Mendis will play instead of Herath.Kamande: We will bat first, the wicket looks good to bat well and entertain the crowd. We need to apply ourselves, we haven't done well in the first two games, we will bat and ensure that we give our bowlers enough total to defend the total.Mathews: We played well against Pakistan in the previous game but just fell some ten runs short. The team that bats first normally holds the upper hand and that's what happened. We were not clinical, but we batted and bowled well. There are a lot of positives to take out from that.Pitch report: The wicket is quite hard, there is a steady covering of grass, the ball will get slower and may assist turn later in the day. 270-280 will be a par score. The team that wins the toss will surely bat first.Hello and welcome, all you cricket lovers. After a beating against Pakistan, Sri Lanka would like to make amends and get their WC campaign running in the right direction when they take on Kenya at Colombo. Kenya have certainly been way below ordinary in their first couple of games and they would have a thing or two to prove by at least getting the basics right. This is Ajith, I will give you company along with Ganesh, Karthik and Pradeep. We'll be back with more updates. Don't go anywhere.Preview by Karthik LakshmananBefore the start of the World Cup, 2 teams from the subcontinent were termed hot favourites to lift the trophy - one was India, and the other Sri Lanka. Their opening games against Bangladesh and Canada respectively showed why. But a week later, rude wake up calls from England and Pakistan exposed weaknesses in their sides and proved that this is the most open World Cup played so far, with many teams having a chance to grab the coveted title. Both teams have a chance to get back on track as they take on relatively easier opponents in their next games. While India takes on Ireland later in the week, Sri Lanka plays Kenya in Colombo on March 1st.Team newsSri Lanka: The Lankans started their World Cup campaign in style by crushing Canada by a mammoth 210 runs in their opening game. The batting and bowling came together as they walloped the hapless minnows with an all round display. But their performance against an unpredictable Pakistani side would have brought them back to the ground. The bowling line up, without Lasith Malinga looked harmless on a flat batting pitch. The pacers lacked penetration and though the spinners - Muralitharan and Herath were economical - they were unable to pick up wickets in the middle overs. The Sri Lankan top order looks extremely strong, with Dilshan, Jayawardene and Sangakkara among the runs in the 2 games. But their long middle order will be a cause of concern. There was ample proof for this in the Pakistan game as the batsmen struggled to score runs once Jayawardene and Sangakkara departed. Arjuna Ranatunga wanted Sangakkara or Jayawardene to bat lower in the line up to strengthen their middle order. It would be interesting to see if the team management considers it.Kenya: It is a time when the minnows are doing their best to impress the ICC in the World Cups. Netherlands gave England a scare, and Ireland almost upset Bangladesh at home. But Kenya on the other hand are doing everything they can to justify the ICC's decision to restrict the number of teams in future World Cups. Nothing is going right for the African team. They started their campaign by getting whacked by the Kiwis in Chennai, losing the game in around 3 hours. They soon followed it up by another shoddy performance against Pakistan, and ended up losing the game by 205 runs. Their bowlers conceded 37 wides against Pakistan, while the batsmen have struggled to measure up to both pace and spin. To make things worse, there are off field controversies with differences between the coach and senior players. Kenya would be desperately hoping for a miracle to put up a decent performance against Sri Lanka at home.Head to Head:Not many in the Sri Lankan team would forget what happened in the 2003 World Cup game in Nairobi. Put in to bat, the Kenyans made a decent 210 and returned with the ball to dismiss Sri Lanka for 157, thus shocking the Lankans by 53 runs. Collins Obuya was the star for Kenya that day, picking up 5 wickets for just 24 runs in his 10 overs. Obuya is still there 8 years later, but a repeat of the 2003 game seems far from possible. Apart from this encounter, the 2 teams have met 4 other times, with the Lankans winning all of them.Quotes:"I don't mind losing to teams like New Zealand and Pakistan because they are obviously better than us but we should be competitive. We need to be seen to be fighting and scoring runs" - Cricket Kenya chief Samir Inamdar.
"We know all about the embarrassment of losing to Kenya after that debacle in Nairobi back in 2003 and they have some useful players in their ranks" Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardena.
