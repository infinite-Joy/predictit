INDIA:26.5 26.5S Raza to M Pandey, FOUR, India take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series with this win! All Pandey needed was a ball to finish the proceedings. Tossed up slightly wide outside off, Pandey leans forward, reaches to the pitch of the ball and drills the drive through the vacant cover region. The ball trickles away to the fence and Pandey, Rayudu punch their gloves in delight.

INDIA:26.4 S Raza to Nair, out Lbw!! Nair will be very disappointed. Instead of hitting the winning runs, he has to make the long walk back to the hut. Kneels down to play the big sweep off this very full delivery, fails to lay bat on it and wears it very low on the pad in line with off stump. The umpire was always going to raise his finger there and India lose their second wicket just 2 runs away from victory. Out comes Manish Pandey. Replays show it was crashing into middle and leg.

Cremer has plenty to say to his team. The Indian openers are out there as well..Welcome back. India are cruising for now and the only thing that remains to be seen is by how many wickets they'll win this game. Don't think they can pull off something similar to Zimbabwe, that is, to lose 6 wickets in 20 runs. Jokes apart, I will change my name if India are to lose this game.Both the Indian openers have gone well so far. Karun Nair was lucky to be caught behind on a no-ball off Chatara. Other than that, it has been rather clinical. KL Rahul is once again looking in great touch and Nair could not have asked for a better platform.

INDIA:4.4 Chatara to Nair, no ball, Nair is very lucky to be out there. He edged a short, wide delivery to the keeper in trying to cut it.

INDIA:0.1 Chatara to Rahul, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, Rahul shoulders armsRahul and Nair are at the crease. Rahul is on strike. Chatara will open the attackIndia are faced with another facile chase, and there shouldn't be too many hiccups to go 2-0 in the series. Or have i spoken too soon? Only time will tell. Out walk the Indian openers. Chatara to take the new ball. Two slips in place.Another disappointing performance by the Zimbabwean batsmen, after being in the driver's seat for a majority of the middle overs. Having lost the toss and put into bat on a gloomy overcast morning, the openers started off positively, but couldn't cope with the seaming conditions and the Indian bowlers did well to keep the ball in the right areas to create problems. But Vusi Sibanda and Sikandar Raza took on the bowlers and put up a fifty-run partnership in quick time. Sibanda in particular looked imperious and struck the ball sweetly. Just as things were looking to be slipping away from the visitors, Chahal triggered a collapse, snaring three wickets in the span of nine deliveries. From a comfortable 106/3, they folded up for a meagre 126. The power packed Indian batting line-up will fancy this chase. Do join us shortly for the Indian reply.3
ZIMBABWE:34.3 Axar to Muzarabani, out Lbw!! Ian Gould took his time before raising the finger. The slider that goes on with the arm, Muzarabani is beaten for pace as he fails to get any wood on the forward defence, is rapped in front of middle and the ball would have crashed into middle and leg-stump.

Tossed up just outside off, Sibanda goes for a wild slog sweep over mid-wicket, gets it off the toe-end and skies it towards long-on, Jadhav judges it to perfection.

ZIMBABWE:25.2 Chahal to S Raza, out Caught by K Jadhav!! Needless! Raza just had to rotate the strike with Sibanda playing so well. Instead he tries a rash shot and perishes in the process. A much required breakthrough for India. Chahal ends the 67-run stand. Floated up outside off, Raza clears his front leg and goes against the turn, smashes it straight down the throat of long-on. He would have been better off hitting it over extra cover or over long-off. S Raza c K Jadhav b Chahal 16(41) [4s-1]Chahal to S Raza, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

ZIMBABWE:19.3 Chahal to Sibanda, no ball, 1 run, the googly from Chahal and Sibanda doesn't pick it, gets an inside edge on the defensive shot, the ball rolls behind square on the leg-side. The bowler has also overstepped and there's a free-hit coming up

ZIMBABWE:18.6 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, well left! This one came in with the angle outside off. Raza first got in line but saw that it was not going towards his stumps, left it late. Well-judged by him
ZIMBABWE:18.5 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, back of a length delivery again, Raza stands tall and punches to the same fielder at cover

ZIMBABWE:17.5 Chahal to Sibanda, SIX, well flighted and Sibanda has made the most of it. Did not skip down the track, cleared his leg a bit and lofted it over, there was a man at long-on but the ball just carried over the fence

ZIMBABWE:16.3 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, and again. This time Raza gets it to fly off the top of his bat, was lucky that it did not carry to the fielder at backward point, similar to the previous delivery it was. In fact, Raza wanted a run as well, was sent back in time
ZIMBABWE:16.2 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, oh Raza is dancing there. What a ball, seam movement which got this one to straighten outside off, there was a lot of bounce as well. Raza just could not get behind the line to block and was beaten
ZIMBABWE:16.1 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, too high and probably doing too much as well. Bumrah got this one to cut in off the pitch, beat Raza's bat on the tuck and it hits him on the pad. The umpire does not oblige the lbw appeal as it was slightly high and would have probably gone over. The angle in would have put some doubts in the mind of the umpire too.Two slips for BumrahDrinks are on the field now. Zimbabwe have resisted so far. They were lucky when the ball beat the outside edge on a number of occasions. However, now that Bumrah is bowling and bowling pretty well, their approach will be interesting to see. What will make matters worse for them is Axar from the other end. He seems to be finishing his overs in no time, ask me how tough it is
ZIMBABWE:15.6 Axar to Sibanda, no run, now we are seeing the Axar we know, fired this one on the stumps. Sibanda was watchful in his defense

ZIMBABWE:15.1 Axar to S Raza, 1 run, flatter delivery outside off, Raza pats it through cover-point
ZIMBABWE:14.6 Bumrah to Sibanda, no run, what should I say? Photocopy of the previous delivery, once again Sibanda is beaten on the push
ZIMBABWE:14.5 Bumrah to Sibanda, no run, oh! Lucky for Sibanda, he played inside the line of the delivery, which held its line and beat his outside edge
ZIMBABWE:14.4 Bumrah to Sibanda, no run, shortish outside off, Sibanda wants to flash the cut and is beaten on it
ZIMBABWE:14.3 Bumrah to Sibanda, FOUR, short of a good length delivery on off and how well has Sibanda timed it. Gets on his toes and punches it past a diving backward point, the ball has enough legs to roll to the fence
ZIMBABWE:14.3 Bumrah to Sibanda, wide, wayward bouncer from Bumrah, hurled it well down the leg-side, was a bit high than he would have intended. Sibanda ducks and it has been called a wide
ZIMBABWE:14.2 Bumrah to Sibanda, 2 runs, waits for this back of a length delivery and steers it wide of third man, takes on the arm of the fielder there and comes back for the second as well
ZIMBABWE:14.1 Bumrah to Sibanda, FOUR, that will give Sibanda some confidence. He likes playing those pick-up shots, on a length from Bumrah and Sibanda whips it over mid-wicket. A couple of bounces before it crosses the fence
ZIMBABWE:13.6 Axar to S Raza, no run, this one keeps a bit low outside off, Raza defends it from his crease in an awkward manner
ZIMBABWE:13.5 Axar to S Raza, no run, another one, not that short. Raza played the trajectory and not the length, was beaten on the cut
ZIMBABWE:13.4 Axar to Sibanda, 1 run, quicker delivery hurling on the stumps with the arm, Sibanda was lucky to get his bat down in time, pushed through cover
ZIMBABWE:13.3 Axar to Sibanda, no run, slower through the air this time, Sibanda gets across and clips to mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:13.2 Axar to S Raza, 1 run, goes straight with the arm, Raza tucks to square leg
ZIMBABWE:13.1 Axar to Sibanda, 1 run, flatter delivery outside off, Sibanda pats it to cover for a singleAxar Patel is here. Slip in placeAxar Patel, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
ZIMBABWE:12.6 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, closer to off this time from that back of a length. Raza prods towards the line of the delivery and blocks towards cover. Nice over from Bumrah, asked a few questions
ZIMBABWE:12.5 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, goes straight outside off, Raza pushed at it, was inside the line of the delivery and got beatenLeg slip in place now
ZIMBABWE:12.5 Bumrah to S Raza, wide, Dhoni is agile. Isn't he? It was hurled down the leg-side and Raza missed the clip, Dhoni had to dive to his left to stop this one. Wide called
ZIMBABWE:12.4 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, seeing that Raza was gettin in line of those, Bumrah goes wide of off this time. Raza wanted him to change his line perhaps, lets it go
ZIMBABWE:12.3 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, almost a replica of the previous delivery, Raza gets across and tucks to mid-on
ZIMBABWE:12.2 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, angles this one and gets it to cut in on the stumps. Raza does well to smother it back to the bowlerTwo slips for him
ZIMBABWE:12.1 Bumrah to S Raza, no run, loosener from Bumrah. Warm-up delivery outside off, near the tramline, left aloneJasprit Bumrah, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
ZIMBABWE:11.6 D Kulkarni to Sibanda, 2 runs, Kulkarni has been bowling those pretty straight and this time has to pay the price, only a little though. Sibanda picks the whip off the middle and sends it over mid-wicket, there are not enough legs on it and will have to be content with a couple
ZIMBABWE:11.5 D Kulkarni to Sibanda, no run, too straight and Sibanda has no problems in getting behind the line of the delivery in defence
ZIMBABWE:11.4 D Kulkarni to Sibanda, no run, much closer to the stumps this time and it allows Sibanda to put his bat on the defence, the ball rolled towards the cover region
ZIMBABWE:11.3 D Kulkarni to Sibanda, no run, lovely from Kulkarni, draws Sibanda on the push with this outswinger and beats his bat with ease
ZIMBABWE:11.2 D Kulkarni to S Raza, 1 run, shortish outside off, strange looking shot from Raza, tries to fetch the flick from well outside off, did well to get it off the meat of the bat. Could not beat mid-wicket though
ZIMBABWE:11.1 D Kulkarni to S Raza, no run, well bowled. Seam movement off the deck from Kulkarni. Pitched on the stumps and moved away to square the batsman up, Raza does well to defend it in the end
ZIMBABWE:10.6 Barinder to Sibanda, no run, well short and wide of off, Sibanda wants to cut and is beaten
ZIMBABWE:10.5 Barinder to Sibanda, no run, slanted outside off, left alone by Sibanda
ZIMBABWE:10.4 Barinder to Sibanda, no run, fuller length delivery outside off, driven well but cannot beat mid-off
ZIMBABWE:10.3 Barinder to Sibanda, FOUR, since it came off the middle of the bat and went through mid-wicket, we are all praise for it. But it was a pull fetched well from outside off. Anyway, well short and too easy for Sibanda to effect the pull. Looked good in the end
ZIMBABWE:10.2 Barinder to Sibanda, no run, Sibanda dithered for a while before trying to poke at it outside off, the ball went straight with the angle. Lucky to have not edged it back to the keeper. Not much bounce on it though
ZIMBABWE:10.1 Barinder to Sibanda, no run, too full outside off, Sibanda jams it towards the fielder at coverSikandar Raza, right handed bat, comes to the creas
ZIMBABWE:9.6 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, out Lbw!! Was it all a ploy from Kulkarni to bowl those outside off? Maybe! Hit this one on a length which held its line. Since it was on the stumps so the line was never a problem, the only question would have been height but it seems fine there. Chibhabha was in his crease trying to work across the line, missed it completely and was rapped on the front knee roll. Would have gone on to hit the leg-stump. Chibhabha lbw b D Kulkarni 21(26) [4s-1]D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
ZIMBABWE:9.5 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, short again. Similar to the previous delivery, Chibhabha cuts and cuts well. But cannot find the gap, hit straight to the fielder at backward point
ZIMBABWE:9.4 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, wide of off again, short as well. Chibhabha tries to clatter the cut, does so. But cannot beat pierce the ring at cover
ZIMBABWE:9.3 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, 2 runs, back of a length around off. Chibhabha punches it, did not quite transfer the weight but has enough on it to fetch him a couple through extra cover
ZIMBABWE:9.2 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, 2 runs, not that short but Chibhabha was ready for the pull. The line was around off and Chibhabha had to fetch it from there to send it through mid-wicket for a couple of runs, was not timed all that well
ZIMBABWE:9.1 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, back of a length delivery with some away swing outside off. More of a Test match line, Chibhabha is happy to leave it
ZIMBABWE:8.6 Barinder to Chibhabha, leg byes, 1 run, the inward movement from Sran has created enough trouble today. Chibhabha once again is not in the line of the delivery and wears it high on his pad for an extra run, the ball would have slid down the leg-side
ZIMBABWE:8.5 Barinder to Chibhabha, 2 runs, nicely done this time. Allows the ball to swing in before working it through mid-wicket for a couple

ZIMBABWE:8.1 Barinder to Chibhabha, 3 runs, well played. Shortish delivery again, allows Chibhabha the time to cut it past point, Pandey from the ring chases it down after putting a dive near the fenceTelepathy has worked. Dhoni got the signals from my colleague Akshay and there was a gully in place during the previous over. Should have told you earlier
ZIMBABWE:7.6 D Kulkarni to Sibanda, no run, short of a good length outside off, Sibanda gets in line and defends towards backward point

ZIMBABWE:7.3 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, 1 run, no feet movement from Chibhabha, just goes with his hands on the drive. Got it off the outer part of the bat towards third man, it was in the air for a while but fell well before the man there
ZIMBABWE:7.2 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, 2 runs, there aren't many sights better than a back foot punch. And this time, Chibhabha effects that. Gets in the line of this back of a length delivery and punches through extra cover, could have timed it a bit better perhaps. Gets hunted well before the fence
ZIMBABWE:7.1 D Kulkarni to Sibanda, 1 run, gets across this time, Sibanda. Covers the line of the swing and pushes it off the inner part of the bat through mid-wicket for a single

ZIMBABWE:6.2 Barinder to Peter Moor, out Lbw!! For all his patience and good lines, Sran has been rewarded once again. This one deserved a wicket. Zipped in off the surface sharply and Moor was glued to his crease, trying to tuck it away. Was hit on the knee roll of the front pad. But he was jumping, so a replay would be interesting here. It might have gone over. I am not so sure, but the replays confirm that it was too high. Moor will feel aggrieved by that call from umpire Gould. Peter Moor lbw b Barinder 1(9)Barinder to Peter Moor, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
ZIMBABWE:6.1 Barinder to Chibhabha, 1 run, edged but away from the slip cordon. Akshay in the comm box wonders why is Dhoni not having a gully? Rightly so. This cut from Chibhabha would have definitely gone in the hands of gully, this one rolls to third man for a single
ZIMBABWE:5.6 D Kulkarni to Peter Moor, no run, similar delivery but this time Moor gets to put the bat behind it as he forces it towards cover-point
ZIMBABWE:5.5 D Kulkarni to Peter Moor, no run, beaten this time. Moor was not in the line of the delivery and pushed at it, the ball moved late and missed the edge of his bat. How fortunate he is to not have edged that?
ZIMBABWE:5.4 D Kulkarni to Peter Moor, no run, just hits the back of a length around off, Moor is watchful as he gets on his toes and gently pushes to extra cover
ZIMBABWE:5.3 D Kulkarni to Peter Moor, no run, and again! Once again no change of approach from Moor who lets this outswinger go through to the keeper
ZIMBABWE:5.2 D Kulkarni to Peter Moor, no run, outswing this time. Moor is wary of it. Does not flirt with it
ZIMBABWE:5.1 D Kulkarni to Peter Moor, no run, did it stay low? Perhaps! More than that it was the lack of swing from Kulkarni that caused some worry for Moor, who expected it to shape away and played for it. The ball went straight and over his off stump, was not that far away from the stumps though
ZIMBABWE:4.6 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, shortish from Sran slanted across, Chibhabha punches it off the inner part of the bat to the bowler

ZIMBABWE:4.3 Barinder to H Masakadza, out Caught by Bumrah!! It was coming, wasn't it? That's the end of Masakadza. He was never going to clear the field with all that swing on offer. Finds third man with ease. Masakadza takes a stride forward in trying to loft it over the infield. But all he could manage was to slice it off the outer edge of the bat towards third man, who takes an easy catch. H Masakadza c Bumrah b Barinder 9(17) [4s-1]Barinder to H Masakadza, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

ZIMBABWE:4.1 Barinder to Chibhabha, no run, goes on with the angle across the right-hander this time. There is enough doubt in his mind, and he won't fiddle at it
ZIMBABWE:3.6 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, Masakadza was tentative this time. Wanted to poke at the away swinger at first but decided to leave it late. Well thought move
ZIMBABWE:3.5 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, 2 runs, off the edge of the toe this time. Masakadza was early on the drive and the ball moved away a bit late to get the edge. Lucky for Masakadza that it went over the man at backward point, has time to come back for a couple
ZIMBABWE:3.4 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, away swinger again. Masakadza is not willing to play at it. Shoulders arms
ZIMBABWE:3.3 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, FOUR, on the up drive from Masakadza. The best thing was that he accounted for the outswing and then flayed the drive through cover. The outfield is not lightning fast, but it still rolls away to the fence. Top shot from Masakadza
ZIMBABWE:3.2 D Kulkarni to H Masakadza, no run, outswing again. Masakadza is not bothered to play at it. Leaves it as it was well outside off
ZIMBABWE:3.1 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, 3 runs, what a pick up shot from Chibhabha, just lofted the wristy flick off his pads. The line was on the stumps and it helped him effect it, the ball was in the air for a while but away from the man at mid-wicket, gets three with ease

ZIMBABWE:2.4 Barinder to H Masakadza, no run, this one changes its path from outside off. Hint of inswing but since it was too wide of off. There was no way, Masakadza was going to play at it
ZIMBABWE:2.3 Barinder to H Masakadza, no run, outswinger outside off, Masakadza does not bother with it, left alone
ZIMBABWE:2.3 Barinder to H Masakadza, wide, drifting this time. Got the inswing but from middle and leg and ball changed its trajectory and went down the leg-side. Masakadza missed the glance and it will be called a wide
ZIMBABWE:2.2 Barinder to Chibhabha, 1 run, length ball on the stumps, Chibhabha gently clips it towards the man at short mid-wicketLeg slip in place now
ZIMBABWE:2.1 Barinder to H Masakadza, 1 run, short ball and Masakadza was not ready for it, did not go back properly. Wanted to pull it from his crease, got a glove to it and went past Dhoni towards fine leg for a single. Nice surprise delivery from Sran
ZIMBABWE:1.6 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, almost, almost got the edge to it. Chibhabha was trying to play this outswinger away from his body, feet did not get in the line of the delivery. Lucky for him once again that he failed to lay bat on the cut, as this would have carried to the keeper
ZIMBABWE:1.5 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, no run, Kulkarni changes the line once again and bowls it well outside off. There is swing for him. However, it is the carry he will be worried about, lack of bounce again
ZIMBABWE:1.4 D Kulkarni to Chibhabha, FOUR, fabulous shot to get off the mark. Gets across on this length delivery and flicks it past a diving mid-on to his right. No chance for Bumrah there at mid-on

ZIMBABWE:0.1 Barinder to H Masakadza, no run, shape in straightaway from Sran. Big appeal for an lbw from Sran as Masakadza fails to put any bat on the flick, but the ball would have missed the stumps. No harm there for MasakadzaH Masakadza and Chibhabha are at the crease. H Masakadza is on strike. Barinder will open the attackOut walk the openers. Bumrah is in full sleeve jumpers, a pacer wearing those tells you how cold it is out there. Hamilton Masakadza is opening today, replacing Peter Moore. Desperate times call for desperate measures you see, the senior pro has taken the matter in his own hands. Sran will have the new ball. Play says the umpireThere is slightly less grass on the pitch this time. But it is the clouds overhead that will be a concern for the hosts. Indian quicks will relish the conditions on hand. Let's see how Zimbabwe change their approach today. They just cannot afford to lose. The series is on the line and it should bring the best out of them. Minutes away from the live actionTeams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Peter Moor, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Vusi Sibanda, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Elton Chigumbura, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Graeme Cremer(c), Tendai Chatara, Taurai MuzarabaniIndia (Playing XI): Lokesh Rahul, Karun Nair, Ambati Rayudu, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni(w/c), Axar Patel, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jasprit Bumrah, Barinder Sran, Yuzvendra ChahalCremer: "Coin is a bit lop-sided here it feels. We would have bowled first as well. I think it has to do with the the conditions. Craig Ervine has a hamstring issue and Sean Williams comes in his place. We will have to bat well as India are playing with the same squad."Dhoni: "We will bowl first. Slightly less grass, but the conditions. It is overcast, quite chilly. The fast bowlers should get help throughout, but it will be more in the morning. There are a couple of cracks and there could be uneven bounce. It looks a tough wicket and we will have to play well. It gets much warmer once you're inside the field. The fast bowlers are the ones who really need to keep themselves warm because you don't want them to be bowling with a stiff back. We are playing with the same XI."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldToss time!There's news coming in that the toss has been delayed by 10 minutes. So, we will have to wait a little longer to know what the winning captain decides to do.Pitch Report: "It's freezing cold. It's very, very cloudy. It feels like you're not playing in Africa, but England. There are a lot of cracks, plenty of them. They shouldn't open up much, but it's still a worry. Is it a good pitch or not? Don't know. I think I will bowl first because I don't know what to do," reckons Pat SymcoxWeather update: Our man at the venue, Prakash Govindasreenivasan, informs us, "Very chilly here in Harare. Been like this since last evening. There was no rain yesterday but lot of dark clouds this morning."Batting in Zimbabwe has traditionally been tough, but debutant KL Rahul's century the other day, proved how desperate he was to make a name for himself in the shorter format. Bowling, as expected, was top-class and captain Dhoni would be mighty pleased with the effort. One man who was not very pleased, albeit for different reasons, was Zimbabwe's interim coach Makhaya Ntini. Ntini wanted India to send their top team for the series. However, the kind of show his boys put up in the first game, they will really need to come up with something special to go past this Indian team. The toss and team updates are coming your way in a short while...08:00 Local Time, 06:00 GMT, 11:30 IST: Hello and welcome to the second ODI of the 3-match series between Zimbabwe and India. The visitors were impeccable in the first clash, registering a thumping 9-wicket win. The hosts were let down by their batting in the previous game and would want to improve on it to pose some challenge to the second-line Indian squad.Preview by Prakash GovindasreenivasanA KL Rahul century on debut and some fine execution of plans from the rest of the Indian side on the field proved one thing - Makhaya Ntini & Co. have a lot to ponder, and as the interim coach would've learnt it the hard way, India's decision to field a second-string team should now be least of his concerns.The inexperienced visitors put Ntini's pre-series disgruntlement over the lack of senior pros in perspective as they schooled a 'much experienced' home side to take an all-important 1-0 lead in the opening fixture of the three-match One-Day International (ODI) series. With just a day's break and a lot to work upon, as per batting coach Lance Klusener's admission, Zimbabwe have their backs to the wall ahead of Monday's fixture.All is, however, not lost for Graeme Cremer's side. If the first game was a glimpse of what is to follow in the series, then they're just some sensible batting away from putting on a competitive show. First and foremost on their agenda should be the need to adapt to early swing, specially generated by Barinder Sran, the left-arm pacer. The likes of Peter Moor and Chamu Chibhabha need not look too far beyond to find inspiration and the skill to tackle the bowlers on a two-paced surface. The undefeated 162-run stand between Rahul and Ambati Rayudu in the first ODI qualifies as a fine case study.On slow burners like Harare, there cannot be enough emphasis on needing to keep a steady head and not letting concentration waiver, irrespective of a lull in scoring. A dedicated effort towards that will help the hosts build partnerships that will in turn pave the way for a challenging total.After an ideal start to the series, India will look to carry on their good work from Saturday. With Zimbabwe batsmen having gotten the first taste of their bowling attack, the onus will be on Dhawal Kulkarni, Sran, Jasprit Bumrah, Yuzvendra Chahal and Axar Patel to keep the pressure going.When: June 13 at 09:00 AM Local Time, 12:30 PM ISTWhere: Harare Sports Club, HarareWhat to expect: Periods of cloud and sun are expected on what should be another fine day for cricket.Team news:India: Sanjay Bangar had hinted ahead of the first game that the management will always look to pick their best XI. Hence, a change to the winning combination seems unlikely.Zimbabwe: It remains unknown why Sean Williams didn't get a game in the first fixture. If the hosts are looking to chop and change a bit, his inclusion could add a lot of weight to a team in need of batting strength. If he is considered, Sikadar Raza could make way. One of the fast bowlers could also sit out in order to make room for Donald Tiripano, the 28-year-old pacer.Who said what:Lance Klusener: We want to draw a line in the sand from the way Zimbabwe have played in the past. We just need to find our balance and figure out how we're going to play. It's a tough team to do that against but nonetheless we'll be more prepared I guess from the batting point of view from the next game.Did you know:- If India win the second match, it will be the first ODI series win under MS Dhoni since October 2014 against West Indies at home.- The top-three for India averages 85.20 in 18 innings with six hundreds in 2016. In contrast Zimbabwe's top-three averages just 32.16 and strikes at a mere 66.09 per 100 balls.- Hamilton Masakadza is the highest run-getter for Zimbabwe in ODIs this year with 233 runs from four innings. Next best is 97 by Peter Moor.Teams:India (From): Lokesh Rahul, Karun Nair, Ambati Rayudu, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni(w/c), Axar Patel, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jasprit Bumrah, Barinder Sran, Yuzvendra Chahal, Faiz Fazal, Rishi Dhawan, Jayant Yadav, Mandeep Singh, Jaydev UnadkatZimbabwe (From): Peter Moor, Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza, Craig Ervine, Vusi Sibanda, Sikandar Raza, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Elton Chigumbura, Graeme Cremer(c), Tendai Chatara, Taurai Muzarabani, Neville Madziva, Donald Tiripano, Timycen Maruma, Wellington Masakadza, Tawanda Mupariwa, Sean Williams, Tendai ChisoroLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
