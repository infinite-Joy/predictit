Can they prevent England from winning their eighth consecutive ODI? This is Sid V to take you through for the England chase.We have an update from the ground. Apparently, during the break, there was a brief shower and the covers were in place. There are still some wet covers on the ground and the start has been slightly delayed. The match will resume at 3:40 PM local, 8:10 PM IST.Watson started his innings aggressively, but later on he was finding it difficult to get going by his standards. Warner, Forrest and Clarke didn't add much to the score. Bailey and Hussey were going strong and they strung a 78 run partnership until a brilliant piece of fielding from Finn got the latter out. England were poor in the field, as they dropped a couple of catches and misfielded a few times. But their bowling was right on target, as everyone except Dernbach got wickets. The pitch has slowed down a bit and England will find it hard to chase it down. Join us in about 30 minutes for the chase....4

For England, Anderson is not fit and Dernback might take his place.Hello and welcome to the 2nd ODI between England and Australia. The Aussies were completely outplayed in the first match as they couldn't play well against a disciplined English bowling attack. Morgan's innings was the turning point as it helped England to post a decent total. Australia's bowling was not up to the mark as they concededed too many runs towards the end. They will look to put up a much improved in this match. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info....Preview by Gokul GopalFollowing a close win in the opening ODI, England will be looking to press forward when they take on Australia in the second match of the series at The Oval. Australia, meanwhile, will be keen to register their first win of the series and get their campaign back on track.England:England, who have a chance to overthrow Australia from the top position in the ODI rankings if they manage a clean-sweep, started the series on the right note with a 15-run win at Lord's. England's top order batsmen, barring Ravi Bopara, were amongst the runs as the hosts put up a challenging total. Eoin Morgan impressed the most with an attacking 89 while Jonathan Trott chipped in with an useful half-century. The openers were in good form too with Alastair Cook and Ian Bell starting well before falling in the forties. Skipper Cook's only disappointment would probably have been that he and Bell could not convert their start into a bigger score. He will look to improve upon his own performance and also hope for a good showing from the rest of his batters heading into the second ODI.In the bowling department, it was the seamers who were amongst the wickets in the first ODI, with James Anderson, Steven Finn, Tim Bresnan and Stuart Broad picking up two wickets each. Despite couple of good partnerships by the Australian batsmen during the course of the game, the England bowlers did not give up attacking and their persistence resulted in the visitors losing wickets at regular intervals. Cook will be expecting a similar performance from his bowlers in the second match and will also hope that Anderson and Bresnan, who were a touch expensive in the first game, come up with a more economical spell with the ball.Australia:Despite half-centuries from David Warner and Michael Clarke, the Aussies ended up short of the target at Lord's mainly due to the failure of some of the batsmen who could not convert their starts. Australia also missed a substantial partnership. Although their were a couple of fifty run stands, one involving Warner and one Clarke, they lost many wickets in between those partnerships. While Shane Watson failed at the top, the middle order, which includes the likes of David Hussey, Steven Smith and Matthew Wade, could not support their skipper, who appeared waging a losing battle. Clarke would have also been disappointed with his own batting as he could not stay till the end to see his team through. The skipper will expecting his batters to quickly fix these chinks and come up with better contributions in the remaining games.Clarke will also be hoping for a better performance from his bowlers as most of them went in excess of 5 an over. Shane Watson was the most expensive, giving away 65 runs from his 10 overs while Brett Lee too had an average outing, picking up just one wicket while conceding 57 runs from his 10. Pat Cummings also did not impress in his outing. Only Clint McKay managed to maintain an economy rate of 4.3. The bowlers need to stick to better line and lengths if they are to restrict the England batsmen and make an impact.Team News:Surrey fast bowler Stuart Meaker was drafted into the England squad as cover for James Anderson, who was struggling with his groin in the opening game. If England decide not to risk playing Anderson, the 21-year old Meaker is likely to get a game. Australia, meanwhile, are unlikely to tinker their line-up unless they decide to bring in Peter Forrest in place of Steven Smith.Quotes:Australia are not the number one ODI side in the world for no reason, and we are going to have to play some exceptionally good cricket to keep beating them: Steven Finn insists that England are not thinking about the 5-0 sweep.I think their bowlers are pretty gettable. They didn't execute their skills enough with the 'death' bowling: David Warner says England's bowling attack can be handled as long as the Australia do not lose quick wickets.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), James Anderson, Jonathan Bairstow, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Jade Dernbach, Steven Finn, Craig Kieswetter(w), Eoin Morgan, Samit Patel, Graeme Swann, Jonathan TrottAustralia (From): Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Pat Cummins, Xavier Doherty, Peter Forrest, Ben Hilfenhaus, David Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Clint McKay, James Pattinson, Steven Smith, Matthew Wade(w), David Warner, Shane WatsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
