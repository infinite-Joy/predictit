PAKISTAN:6.6  Finn to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, probing lines outside off, Misbah lets it go to the keeperMisbah-ul-Haq, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:6.5  Finn to Younis Khan, out Caught by Kieswetter!! Finn wins the battle! There was a small little battle building up between Younis and Finn but it is the bowler who has the last laugh. And he has to thank Kieswetter for that too.. what an excellent catch! This was again in good lengths outside off, Younis was trying to defend but the ball nipped in slightly, took the inside edge and flew to the ;eft of Kieswetter who flew across and took it in the air. Excellent bowling, excellent catching, important wicket. Younis Khan c Kieswetter b Finn 15(18) [4s-2] Finn to Younis Khan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:6.4  Finn to Younis Khan, no run, once again in good areas around off, Younis pushes it to point, who needlessly has a shy at the bowler's end
PAKISTAN:6.3  Finn to Younis Khan, no run, back of a length and around off, Younis defends to the off side
PAKISTAN:6.2  Finn to Younis Khan, FOUR, beautiful shot! Younis Khan looks in superb form here. This was not too full but Younis stretched forward and drove it with a straight bat, Finn dives, and then the man at mid off dives but both can't stop it.. this is an excellent battle between bat and ball. Between Younis and Finn.
PAKISTAN:6.1  Finn to Younis Khan, no run, short of length and straight, Younis hops and looks to work it across the line but gets an inside edge onto the pads

PAKISTAN:5.1  Anderson to Younis Khan, 1 run, good length and around off, Younis Khan stays back and steers it to third man for one
PAKISTAN:4.6  Finn to Imran Farhat, no run, excellent delivery to end the over, angles this away from the left hander and nips away after pitching, Farhat follows the movement and pushes but gets beaten
PAKISTAN:4.5  Finn to Younis Khan, 3 runs, sloppy (and a bit funny) fielding. Younis clips this between mid wicket and mid on, there was only 2 but KP and Samit make a mess while chasing it, KP gets to the ball first and flicks the ball back, but it goes well past Samit Patel.. the batsmen make it 3
PAKISTAN:4.4  Finn to Younis Khan, no run, solid again. Gets neatly forward and meets the ball with a straight bat, solidly defended
PAKISTAN:4.3  Finn to Younis Khan, no run, good bowling and good batting. Fast stuff outside off, Younis doesn't poke away from the body and lets it go, Finn is getting a lot of bounce and carryFinn has to abort his run up as Younis Khan has some problems behind the bowler's arm..

PAKISTAN:2.2  Finn to Shafiq, out Lbw!! 2 in 2 for Finn! What a start this! Almost a carbon-copy of the previous dismissal, with only slight differences. Finn bowls this from close to the stumps and gets it to nip in after pitching, Shafiq got a decent stride forward but could not make contact with the ball, gets struck right in front of his middle stump. There was only one way that ball was going, and that was towards the stumps. Finn is on a hat-trick now, and Pakistan are in early trouble. Shafiq lbw b Finn 0(1) Finn to Shafiq, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Asad Shafiq, right handed bat, comes to the creaseAnother lbw appeal. Again given out. And he won't review it!!
PAKISTAN:2.1  Finn to Hafeez, out Lbw!! Well deserved wicket for Steve Finn. He has been bowling straight right from the first ball and gets his man now. Another fast, full and straight ball which nips in slightly after pitching, Hafeez gets half-forward and pushes but fails to make contact, only an inside edge could have saved him but he didn't get any bat on it, wisely decides against the review and walks off. England strike early, that's a good start for the hosts. Hafeez lbw b Finn 5(11) [4s-1] Finn to Hafeez, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Hafeez has been given out lbw. Will he review it? That looked pretty plumb. He won't review it.

PAKISTAN:1.3  Anderson to Hafeez, no run, beaten! Superb outswinger that. Angles in and then shapes away, Hafeez was completely squared up as the ball moves from middle and past his bat, Hafeez has a smile on his face - he knows how good a ball that was
PAKISTAN:1.2  Anderson to Imran Farhat, leg byes, 1 run, a bit of in-swing this time, curves in and goes off the pads to square leg for a leg bye
PAKISTAN:1.1  Anderson to Imran Farhat, FOUR, that is a stylish way to get off the mark! Excellent start for Farhat, but not so good from Anderson. Starts with a half volley and allows Farhat to drive, he does so with a good stride forward and places it between the bowler and mid off with a straight bat.. excellent shotJames Anderson, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:0.6  Finn to Hafeez, no run, good leave. Finn bowls this in good areas just outside off, gets good carry to Kieswetter as Hafeez leaves. Good over from Finn, despite the boundary
PAKISTAN:0.5  Finn to Hafeez, no run, stump to stump stuff again from Finn, Hafeez stays back and works it to the on side
PAKISTAN:0.4  Finn to Hafeez, no run, an appeal for lbw but the bounce and the inside edge saved him. Finn holds back the length a bit, Hafeez is stuck on the crease and gets an inside edge onto his pads
PAKISTAN:0.3  Finn to Hafeez, FOUR, too straight this time. Strays on the pads and Hafeez accepts the gift, flicks it past the man standing at square leg and gets off the mark with a boundary, that also shows what a good pitch this still is
PAKISTAN:0.2  Finn to Hafeez, no run, back of a length and angled in, Hafeez stays back and works it to the on side, mid wicket and mid on converge to prevent a single
PAKISTAN:0.1  Finn to Hafeez, no run, on target first ball, starts with a very full one on the stumps, Hafeez defends it to the off sideHafeez and Imran Farhat are at the crease. Hafeez is on strike. Finn will open the attackWelcome back. Pakistan have to get 261 to start the series on a winning note. It is very gettable, but they have to work hard. Steven Finn has the ball, finally!Saeed Ajmal shows the ball to the cameras as he walks off the field. He, along with Alastair Cook, were the stars of the innings. Afridi's twin strikes threatened to take the game away from England, but Cook, along with Bopara, steadied the ship and built a solid platform. However, Ajmal totally blasted the platform in the final few overs with his maiden 5 wicket haul. England were looking good for a score in excess of 270, but lost their way in the final few overs. This is still a good score though, and Pakistan will have to work hard to get them. Join us in half an hour for the chase.4
ENGLAND:49.6  Riaz to Swann, no run, what a superb last over that. Ends it with another well disguised slower ball, Swann misses the heave and can't steal the single as Umar Akmal is quick behind the stumps. England end with 260, which could have been a lot more had they batted better in the death.
ENGLAND:49.5  Riaz to Swann, FOUR, unlucky for Wahab. That is a genuine edge but Swann collects four to third man, maintains it very full on the off, Swann looks to drive but gets a thick edge to third man.. useful runs these!
ENGLAND:49.4  Riaz to Swann, no run, excellent slower ball. Swann had no clue about that one! Closes his eyes and slogs but the ball comes on only after the shot is finished and goes to the keeper.. excellent stuff from Wahab!
ENGLAND:49.4  Riaz to Swann, wide, not so good this time. But a harsh call from the umpire I guess. Sprays it just over the wide indicator line outside off, but the umpire reckons it is wide enough to be called
ENGLAND:49.3  Riaz to Samit Patel, 1 run, in the slot but very straight from Riaz, Samit Patel slaps it down to long on for one, this is good bowling from Riaz
ENGLAND:49.2  Riaz to Swann, leg byes, 1 run, Swann looks to make room but Riaz follows him, Swann adjusts and looks to heave but it goes off the pads to the on side for a single
ENGLAND:49.1  Riaz to Swann, no run, superb start to the final over though, a pacy yorker just outside off, Swann can't jam it down but wants a single, but Samit Patel sends him back rightlyThe highly inconsistent Riaz will bowl the final over..
ENGLAND:48.6  Umar Gul to Samit Patel, FOUR, shot! Samit Patel is getting some useful runs for England here. This was full and outside off, Samit makes room and slaps it hard over the fielder at backward point, ends the over with an one-bounce boundary
ENGLAND:48.5  Umar Gul to Samit Patel, 2 runs, again goes straight down the ground but hasn't timed it too well. Full and straight, Samit Patel drives this hard past Gul and collects a couple
ENGLAND:48.4  Umar Gul to Samit Patel, FOUR, that's the best place to hit - straight down the ground. Slower ball from Gul but that was too wide outside off, Samit reaches out and lofts it flat-batted over Gul for a boundary.. good batting
ENGLAND:48.3  Umar Gul to Swann, 1 run, direct hit and he was gone! Swann defends to backward point and calls for a single, Samit Patel responds and luckily for him, Hafeez fails to hit direct at the batting end
ENGLAND:48.2  Umar Gul to Samit Patel, 1 run, well bowled, yorker length just outside off, Samit digs it out and runs it to third man

ENGLAND:47.5  Riaz to Swann, 1 run, holds back the length slightly, Swann makes room and slaps it over covers, goes on the bounce to the man in the deep
ENGLAND:47.4  Riaz to Swann, FOUR, lovely shot, but I must say it was poor fielding too. Half volley on the pads, Swann shuffles across slightly and whips it off his pads over mid wicket, Shafiq runs across from deep square leg and does not even bother to put in a dive even though the ball was pretty close to him..all these runs count!
ENGLAND:47.3  Riaz to Swann, 2 runs, drags this slightly short and gives him width, Swann stays back and steers it past backward point for a couple
ENGLAND:47.2  Riaz to Swann, no run, good stuff from Riaz. This was defended softly to the on side, Swann tries to steal a single but Riaz charges in and prevents it.. alert and quick stuff from the bowler
ENGLAND:47.1  Riaz to Samit Patel, 1 run, full and outside off, Samit Patel drives it to sweeper cover for one
ENGLAND:46.6  Ajmal to Swann, no run, spins in to his pads and strikes him in front of leg stump, ends an excellent spell from Ajmal. He didn't get a wicket in his first 5 overs but has triggered a mini collapse towards the end. He gets huge cheers from the crowd and he acknowledges them..Graeme Swann, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:46.5  Ajmal to Broad, out Caught&Bowled!! Soft dismissal. And guess what? Ajmal has taken 5 wickets. That's not a surprise, but the fact that this is his 1st 5 wicket haul in ODIs is a big, big surprise. Better late than never though. Anyway, getting back to the dismissal, this was another quicker one, Broad gets forward and lamely chips it back. The last few overs are not going the way England wanted them to.. Broad c and b Ajmal 1(2) Ajmal to Broad, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!
ENGLAND:46.4  Ajmal to Samit Patel, 1 run, floated around off, Samit Patel pushes it to point for one
ENGLAND:46.3  Ajmal to Broad, 1 run, slow through the air on the middle and leg, Broad sweeps this to deep backward square legStuart Broad, left handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:46.2  Ajmal to Alastair Cook, out Bowled!! 4th wicket for Ajmal! Quicker one from round the stumps, Cook tries to sweep but the ball goes past his bat even before he can get down, such was the pace on the ball as it strikes leg. Ajmal roars in delight, he looks a bit angry too, but what a knock from the England captain! A much needed, inspirational performance from the skipper on what has been a tough tour for his team. Alastair Cook b Ajmal 137(142) [4s-14] Ajmal to Alastair Cook, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
ENGLAND:46.1  Ajmal to Alastair Cook, 2 runs, flighted up outside off, Cook drags it from there and hits it between deep mid wicket and long on for a couple

ENGLAND:45.4  Riaz to Samit Patel, 1 run, full delivery outside off, Samit stretches and square drives it to sweeper, off the mark with one
ENGLAND:45.4  Riaz to Samit Patel, wide, another extra from Riaz. He has been inconsistent today..sprays this down the leg and concedes a run, Samit will be unhappy for missing out on a scoring opportunity though
ENGLAND:45.3  Riaz to Samit Patel, no run, back of a length and rising on the leg stump line, Samit stays back and blocks it
ENGLAND:45.2  Riaz to Samit Patel, no run, beauty! Beats him completely with a fast, away moving delivery around off, Samit was stuck in the crease as he tried a lame poke, but was lucky to miss the edge

ENGLAND:44.5 Ajmal to Kieswetter, out Caught by Riaz!! Had to happen. You could almost see it coming. Nicely flighted on the leg side, Kieswetter makes room and goes for a wild slog, only manages a top edge which is taken at short third. Ajmal has his third, and England are losing their way in the death overs. Kieswetter c Riaz b Ajmal 9(19) Ajmal to Kieswetter, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ENGLAND:44.4  Ajmal to Alastair Cook, 1 run, a lot of width outside off, Cook slaps it square of the wicket and collects one to sweeper
ENGLAND:44.3  Ajmal to Alastair Cook, FOUR, superb shot! Nobody moved. And the best thing is, it's a proper, cricketing shot. Goes on his knees and sweeps this hard, picks it from outside off and splits the 2 men in the deep on the leg side.. excellent batting, he has to go for his shots as Kieswetter is struggling
ENGLAND:44.2  Ajmal to Kieswetter, 1 run, flat delivery from round the stumps, Kieswetter goes on his knees and half-pulls it to deep backward square leg

ENGLAND:43.5  Riaz to Alastair Cook, no run, Cook tries to be cheeky but that's not his strength. Goes for the pre-meditated scoop over short fine and misses it completely, gets struck on the pads outside off. He wants to steal a single but Riaz was quick and alert
ENGLAND:43.4  Riaz to Alastair Cook, no run, much straighter and fuller, Cook drives well but can't beat extra cover
ENGLAND:43.4  Riaz to Alastair Cook, wide, rubbish ball. Sprays this very very very wide outside off and concedes an extra, England will accept those with glee
ENGLAND:43.3  Riaz to Alastair Cook, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, Alastair Cook drives it to deep backward point, runs well and makes it 2, good effort from the batsman batting for 43 overs!
ENGLAND:43.2  Riaz to Kieswetter, 1 run, there comes the attempted pressure release. Comes down the track and looks to slog it over the off side, only manages a mishit that goes high and lands safely before sweeper cover. Kieswetter was lucky there
ENGLAND:43.1  Riaz to Kieswetter, no run, beaten. Kieswetter is struggling to pick Riaz. Short and nipping away around off, Kieswetter goes on the backfoot and pushes away from the body but misses
ENGLAND:42.6  Shahid Afridi to Kieswetter, 1 run, another quick, skiddy one to end the over, Kieswetter pulls it to deep backward square leg. That ends Afridi's spell - slightly expensive but he gave Pakistan the twin strikes

ENGLAND:41.3  Riaz to Alastair Cook, 1 run, Cook can't do much, this was in the slot but he swats it along the ground to long on, Riaz won't be too unhappy with that
ENGLAND:41.3 Riaz to Kieswetter, no ball, 1 run, Riaz has problems with the no balls. It just won't stop. Oversteps and bowls short, Kieswetter pushes to point for one. Free hit coming up.

ENGLAND:41.1  Riaz to Kieswetter, no run, fast, full and outside off, Kieswetter throws his bat at it but misses. Very close to being called a wide, Riaz gets away with itWahab Riaz [2.0-0-18-0] is back into the attack. He was expensive early on, can he get it to reverse now?
ENGLAND:40.6  Shahid Afridi to Kieswetter, 1 run, mix up but Kieswetter is safe. Plays this to short third man and hesitates for the run, goes through after seeing Cook charge in but Ajmal's wide throw at the bowler's end allows Kieswetter to complete the run easily, Pakistan have been sloppy on the field today

ENGLAND:39.3 Ajmal to Eoin Morgan, out Lbw!! Too cute, too early. Bye bye Morgan. Ajmal gets this doosra to spin in from outside off, Morgan, probably playing for the off spinner, tries to reverse sweep and was struck on the back-pad right in front of the middle stump. All 3 reds - pitching in line, impact in line and striking leg - so Morgan has to go. Pakistan fight back in the batting powerplay. Eoin Morgan lbw b Ajmal 2(8) Ajmal to Eoin Morgan, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Morgan is given out lbw. Will he review it? Yes he will.  Looks pretty close, and hawk eye sends Morgan back to the pavilion.

ENGLAND:38.1  Umar Gul to Alastair Cook, FOUR, edged and four to third man. No luck for Gul, he has a "what can I do" kind of look on his face. Decent ball that - a good length delivery around off, Cook looks to cut but it was too close to him, manages an edge that goes fine to the third man fence
ENGLAND:37.6  Ajmal to Eoin Morgan, no run, doosra from Ajmal, spins in from outside off and brushes Morgan's pads as he shoulders arms, successful over ends
ENGLAND:37.5  Ajmal to Eoin Morgan, no run, loopy and straight, Morgan blocks it this time

ENGLAND:37.3  Ajmal to Eoin Morgan, no run, given air on the off, Eoin Morgan gets forward and blocks itEoin Morgan, left handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:37.2  Ajmal to Bopara, out Stumped!! Batting powerplay strikes. After playing so well, Bopara charges down madly and throws his bat at this straighter one, misses it completely and is stumped by a mile. Umar Akmal, who missed a stumping chance early on, makes no mistake this time. Can't blame Bopara though, he had to go for his shots. A fine contribution comes to an end.

ENGLAND:37.1  Ajmal to Bopara, no run, flighted up from round the stumps, Bopara works it to mid wicketDrinks are on the field now

ENGLAND:36.5  Umar Gul to Alastair Cook, 1 run, low full toss wide outside off, Cook stretches and steers it to third man
ENGLAND:36.4  Umar Gul to Alastair Cook, FOUR, superb shot. Just a push, that. Cook picks up the slower ball and just punches it on the up, places it to perfection between extra cover and mid off for a boundary, Younis Khan gave chase and put up a dive near the ropes but in vain
ENGLAND:36.3  Umar Gul to Bopara, 1 run, full again but lots of width outside off, luckily for Gul, Bopara mishits the drive to mid off, just a single

We are playing two seamers. Everybody is sticking to the basics and they are giving some good performances. We just want to bat better. We have struggled in the batting and this ODI series gives us a chance to bat well. Shahid Afridi is a wonderful player and he contributes well with the ball in ODIs.Cook: I will bat first as it is a good wicket. Bresnan misses out today. I am looking forward to opening the batting with KP. He got us off to a good start in the World Cup. We need to learn how to rotate the strike and we hope to bat freely. We start afresh and we can put pressure on Pakistan.Pitch Report: This is a dry pitch. There are a lot of cracks but this pitch has a nice sheen on it. Nick Knight reckons that it will be a batting paradise and it will be a trial by spin for England. The average score is 251.Pakistan have been wonderful with the bat and the ball but have struggled in the fielding. England will be looking to exploit this weakness as they look for a turn-around in this tour. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.There are some changes in the England squad. Tim Bresnan comes back after missing the Test series due to an elbow injury. Ian Bell and Andrew Strauss have returned home. Kevin Pietersen, who had a torrid time in the Tests, will open the batting.Welcome to the first of the four ODIs between Pakistan and England from Abu Dhabi. Pakistan have been on a high after whitewashing England 3-0 in the Tests. They have been in exceptional form even in the ODIs. Since January 2011, Pakistan have played 33 ODIs, with 25 victories and seven losses. England have not maintained their consistency in the ODI format and Pakistan will be looking to exploit this aspect.Preview by Gokul GopalHaving suffered a 0-3 blanking in the Test series, England now head into the ODIs eager to make amends and regain some of their lost pride. On the other hand, Pakistan who have been in splendid form in all forms of the game, will look to add more to their wins tally.Pakistan: While they have been on top of their game in the Test format, the World Cup semi-finalists have also been very successful in the One-day arena. Since January 2011, Pakistan have played 33 ODIs and have lost only 7 matches, including a loss to India in the 2011 World Cup. Since 2011, Pakistan have secured series victories against Sri Lanka, New Zealand, West Indies, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Ireland apart from winning six games in the World Cup. They also won the only ODI against Afghanistan recently.Coming to the current series, the Pakistan squad for the five ODIs against England is a very balanced one with the right mix of fine batsmen, quality allrounders and world class bowlers. While Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq bring their experience into play in the middle order, Pakistan also have talented batsmen like Imran Farhat, Asad Shafiq, Umar Akmal and Azhar Ali. The presence of all-rounders like Mohammad Hafeez, Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik provides the added strength to both batting and the bowling departments although Afridi of late is better known for his exploits with the ball than the bat. In the bowling division, Pakistan have plenty to choose from - fine bowlers like Saeed Ajmal, Abdur Rehman and Umar Gul are the main pillars in the bowling department while the likes of Aizaz Cheema, Junaid Khan and Wahab Riaz can also be counted upon to deliver. Overall, Pakistan have a quality side which knows how to perform well in Asian conditions and unless England do something different from the Test series, Misbah's team are clearly the favourites to take the series.Recent games: Pakistan played against Afghanistan in an ODI and won by a comfortable margin of 7 wickets with 77 deliveries remaining. Shahid Afridi was the star with the ball, picking up 5/36 while Younis Khan (70*), Imran Farhat (52) and Misbah (40*) did well with the bat.England: England have been a quality Test side in the last couple of years, barring the series loss against Pakistan. However, the same cannot be said of them in the 50-over format as they have been struggling to feature as one of the top sides in ODIs. Out of 30 ODIs since Jan 2011, England have lost 16 and have only won eleven. In the World Cup, England won 3 matches and lost 3 with one tied game against India. As far as bilateral series are concerned, England managed a series win against Sri Lanka, winning at home against India and losing to the same side while touring the sub-continent and losing to Australia.Looking at England's line-up for the series against Pakistan, the arrival of young blood like Craig Kieswetter, Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow makes the batting order look sightly refreshing when compared to the Test series. While Alastair Cook, Jonathan Trott and Kevin Pietersen have an important role to play at the top of the order, Eoin Morgan, who has been a quality ODI player, occupies a crucial position in the middle order.As far as allrounders are concerned, England have Stuart Broad and Tim Bresnan, who have served the country well with both the bat and the ball in the past. The spearheads in the England bowling line-up are Graeme Swann and James Anderson while skipper Cook can also choose from the likes of Steven Finn, Samith Patel and Jade Dernbach. Overall, England have a well-balanced ODI side but considering their not-so-good form in the limited overs format and their inability to perform in Asian conditions, Pakistan hold edge in this series.Recent games: England recently played a practice match against the England Lions at Abu Dhabi. After bowling out the Lions for 91, England set themselves a nominal target of 231 to get some batting practice, which they achieved in 45.5 overs. Finn and Dernbach picked up 3 wickets apiece while Trott (75*), Cook (68), Pietersen (41) and Bopara (36) found form with the bat.Numbers Game:6: The number of ODIs that England have lost in the UAE. They have played a total of 13 ODIs and have won 7.107: The number of runs Shahid Afridi requires to become the 7th Pakistan player with 7000 or more ODI runs.Teams:Pakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdur Rehman, Aizaz Cheema, Adnan Akmal(w), Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq, Imran Farhat, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Gul, Umar Akmal, Younis Khan, Wahab Riaz, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Hammad AzamEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Ravi Bopara, James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Jonathan Trott, Tim Bresnan, Jonathan Bairstow, Danny Briggs, Jos Buttler, Jade Dernbach, Craig Kieswetter(w), Samit PatelLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
