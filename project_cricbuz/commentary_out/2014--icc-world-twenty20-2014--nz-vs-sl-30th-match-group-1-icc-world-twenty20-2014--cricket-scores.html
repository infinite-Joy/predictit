Guptill is on strike. N Kulasekara will open the attackWelcome back..Boult: "Obviously, it is pretty satisfying. The team has done one heck of a job to restrict Sri Lanka to a low total. Half the job done. It was a skiddy wicket. We tried to manipulate the swing early on. It's pretty wet out there. This is my first night game. We would have taken 119 at the start of the game. It is up to the batters now."Sri Lanka never got going after being asked to bat first. Kusal Perera was a tad unlucky, but Dilshan and Sangakkara, for all their experience played in a shocking manner. The middle order was put under pressure, Mahela, Thirimanne and Mathews fell trying to lift the scoring rate. Thisara and Senanayake biffed some blows during the end overs, but New Zealand will take 119 on any day. Boult was the star performer with three wickets, and the rest chipped in with useful scalps. NZ will fancy this chase, but cricket is a funny game. Join us in a while for the chase.1

Mills will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. This is a winner take all match, with South Africa already through to the semis. Who will join them? We will get to know in some time.Pitch report: "There is a cool breeze blowing along. There will be some dew but not much. The pitch is on the slower side. If the ball stays dry, the slower bowlers will get something out of it. The batsmen should not aim too high. 160 will be a good score on this pitch. It will be a good toss to lose", reckons Russel Arnold.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Angelo Mathews, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga(c)New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Brendon McCullum(c), Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Trent Boult, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghanMalinga: "This is a good feeling for me and I am looking forward to do my best for the country. I was struggling with my knee a couple of months ago but I am in good rhythm. The top-order batsmen are in good touch. We are looking forward to score well and try and defend it later. The last game there was a lot of dew but today there is not much. Lakmal, Prasanna not playing."McCullum: "We got to increase our performance a little bit, we've played okay so far but we have to play very well to beat a side like Sri Lanka. We will bowl first. Still plenty of time for the dew to arrive. Chasing here isn't the worst thing and we'll look to keep them to a par total. My back is alright and we are going in with the same team. We are confident."New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to fieldNew Zealand on the other hand had their skipper Brendon McCullum among the runs and with Kane Williamson doing well at the top, need to tackle the Sri Lankan attack, which is filled with a lot of variety, sensibly. Right then, we've seen the dew factor has a considerable amount of influence on the result of the game. Teams bowling second have literally had to bowl with a wet ball and the captain winning the toss, irrespective of the pitch condition, wanted to close his eyes and say 'we are having a bowl.' Will it be the same story tonight as well? We'll find out that and more in a short while.So then, we are down to the final game of Group 1 and what a cracker of a contest we have on the cards. It's a winner-takes-it-all contest between New Zealand and 2012 runners-up Sri Lanka. Whoever comes up trumps here will book a place in the semi-finals. Sri Lanka will be without the services of their original skipper Dinesh Chandimal as he's been banned for one game for his side's slow over-rate against England. So the side will be led by Lasith Malinga and he'll hope that this will not be the final T20I appearance for Sri Lankan legends Kumar Sangakkar and Mahela Jayawardene, who have announced that this will be their final tournament.PreviewNew Zealand: It's a virtual quarter-final when New Zealand take on Sri Lanka in a Group 1 Super 10s game in the T20 WC in Chittagong on Monday. South Africa are already through to the semis and it now remains to be seen which of New Zealand and Sri Lanka, both with four points each, is the second side to enter the last-four.New Zealand got off to a lucky start against England, winning on Duckworth Lewis, but faced a reality check against South Africa when Dale Steyn's sensational last over stopped them in their tracks. However, with players like Ross Taylor and the most successful batsman in T20 Internationals, Brendon McCullum in the ranks, the Black Caps will be a potent force. New Zealand certainly have the fire-power to get the better of Sri Lanka but it could all get down to nerves in a high-profile clash of a high-profile tournament.Sri Lanka: The sub-continental giants will miss the services of skipper Dinesh Chandimal after he was suspended for one match after a slow over rate in a defeat to England. Lasith Malinga will lead in Chandimal's absence and it could be a great chance to assert himself as a leader in the limited format.Sri Lanka too have some destructive players in T20 cricket and a defeat Monday evening could mean the end of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumara Sangakkara's T20I careers - both senior batsmen had said before the start of the T20 WC, that this tournament would be their last.Despite entering the twilight of their careers, both men have been in sublime form. While Sangakkara was majestic in the Asia Cup, Jayawardene showed his class with a blistering 51-ball 89, albeit in a losing cause against England.Malinga will obviously be key to Sri Lanka's success but another man itching to make some impact would be Ajantha Mendis, the mystery spinner, who went for 52 runs off his four overs, without a wicket against EnglandQuotes:As captain I want every single player to prove his skills in tomorrow's game - Lasith MalingaTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Angelo Mathews, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith Malinga(c), Ajantha Mendis, Rangana Herath, Seekkuge Prasanna, Suranga LakmalNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Brendon McCullum(c), Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, Tim Southee, Anton Devcich, Ronnie Hira, Colin MunroLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
