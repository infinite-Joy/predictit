But Stoinis was confident and Dharmasena after discussing with Gough went to the third umpire. Replays were evident that it bounced in front of Wade. Lucky escape for StokesStoinis goes up for a caught behind shout. But did it carry? Smith has reviewed it. Umpire Dharmasena consults with umpire Gough and they send it upstairs. Not sure if this is Australia's review. Looks like the umpires themselves have sent this upstairs. Anyway, "It is a fair delivery. Can you go to front on spin vision please? Split screen please? Is that the best you have? Front on to finish. Kumar there is enough evidence to suggest that the ball bounced. It is not a fair catch," says third umpire Joel Wilson.

Jason Roy is on strike. J Pattinson will open the attackThe players are out in the centre. Pattinson will open the proceedings with the ball. There are two slips in place.England made exactly 300 in the last game, but they will be chasing that total this time around. With Starc rested, let's see how John Hastings bowls today. We saw Ali and Rashid getting some turn from the pitch, but Agar was left out for this game in place of Marcus Stoinis, who is also a medium-pacer. The onus in the spin department will now be on Maxwell. Let's see whether Australia can win the series today or whether England take the series to the final one-dayer at Old Trafford.Just in the nick of time though, Liam Plunkett picked up two wickets in a single over before Hastings and Wade gave a fine exhibition of power-hitting. Australian pacers might get the new ball to swing and it won't be easy to overhaul this target. Remember, despite losing the last game at Old Trafford, Australia lead the five-match series 2-1.Earlier, David Willey, playing in his first game of the series, accounted for the first three wickets to fall. He swung the new ball both ways and dented Australia's top-order. However, Bailey and Maxwell held the innings together. Maxwell, in particular, checked in a wide array of shots. He took a heavy toll off Rashid and tonked him for two sixes and a four in his 4th over. However, it has to be said that he was dropped twice in his innings. On the other hand, Bailey played a steady hand. He mainly looked to pat the ball into gaps and keep the scorecard ticking.Glenn Maxwell and George Bailey notched up fine fifties to pilot the tourists to a substantial total. However, England to some extent pulled things back by taking a cluster of wickets around the 40th over. In fact, if it wasn't for those lusty blows from John Hastings and Matthew Wade, the visitors could have fallen apart. The duo put on an enterprising stand to lift Australia's spirits. Wade even cracked a vital fifty.When Australia lost three wickets for 5 runs around the 40-over mark, things were not looking promising for the visitors, but this brilliant 50-ball 84-run partnership has given them a very good total. In fact, these two scored 77 runs in the last 6 overs.4

All three games in the series have been won by the side batting first. Will it remain that way? Or can the home side change that? Willey to take the new ball in Finn's absence. Just a lone slip in place. Off we go...Teams:England (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jonathan Bairstow(w), Moeen Ali, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Mark WoodAustralia (Playing XI): Joe Burns, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, John Hastings, Pat Cummins, James PattinsonMorgan: "We would have batted as well. Certainly the wicket looks dry, if we can restrict Australia to a decent score, it would be great to bat in the afternoon. Two changes for us, Steve Finn has been rested, Chris Woakes is injured, so Mark Wood and David Willey are playing. The reason behind resting Finn is we don't want to get to a stage where we are reliant on one or two bowlers in the side. Willey brings a lot of swing early on, he's a sort of a lad who loves to take responsibility. It's a must-win game for us."Smith: "We are going to bat. I think the wicket looks quite dry. Hopefully we can start well with the bat and take their two spinners out of the game. We didnt't play them well in the last game. Marcus Stoinis debuts in place of Ashton Agar. John Hastings is in for Mitchell Starc, who has been rested. Starc has played throughout the summer, he deserves the rest. This is an opportunity for Hastings. Hopefully Maxi (Maxwell) and Finchy, who have played here for Yorkshire, can get a few runs on this wicket."Australia have won the toss and have opted to batWith David Warner and Shane Watson out injured, Australia looked below par in the last game. However, one can also not discount the fact that England are without three of their star players - Joe Root, Stuart Broad and James Anderson. England though found a suitable replacement for Root in the form of James Taylor. Batting at number 3, the Nottinghamshire batsman has made 40+ scores in the three games of the series so far, including his maiden century in the very last game. He will again be looking to make a big score today. Stay tuned for the toss and the teams.Considering how the Australians have a history of never backing down, only a fool can write them off. They will be looking to make amends after their loss and you can expect a good fight from both the teams today. Chris Woakes has been ruled out for the final two games with a thigh injury and one of the three - Mark Wood, David Willey, Reece Topley, is expected to replace him today. For Australia, there's news coming in that Marcus Stoinis will be making his ODI debut today.England will be brimming with confidence right now and even though Australia hold the advantage with a lead of 2-1, a win for the Englishmen here will provide a beautiful set-up for the finale of the tour, the final ODI at Old Trafford. However, don't rule Steven Smith's men out. They do have the firepower to finish the series today. It will be interesting to see what the toss has to offer. The team that has batted first went on to win the game as well. With the game starting at 10:30 local, it will be interesting to see whether the captain who wins the toss decides to bat first here as well.With a win in the third ODI, England have kept their hopes of winning the series alive. Australia, who had completely outplayed the hosts in the first two ODIs, struggled to chase England's 300 down and fell short by 93 runs at Old Trafford. Hello and welcome to our coverage of the fourth ODI between England and Australia.Preview:After James Taylor's maiden century in Manchester helped England narrow the 2-0 series deficit to 2-1, the Eoin Morgan-led side will hope to consolidate further on Friday, in their quest for survival. Steven Smith's Australia will be keen to regard the third ODI loss as just a minor aberration and aim to seal the series in Leeds.Having conceded the highly-coveted urn, the visiting side will want to leave no stones unturned in wrapping up the series on Friday and cut short the euphoria in Leeds following Yorkshire's historic County Championship victory on Wednesday.Date: September 11, 2015Time: 15:00 IST, 09:30 GMTVenue: Headingley, LeedsWeather: Breezy with periods of sunshine. Maximum temperature of 19 degree CelsiusEnglandTaylor's series-saving effort in Manchester came as a birthday present for skipper Eoin Morgan, who turned 29 on Wednesday. After enduring a lean patch during the World Cup, Morgan will be pleased with his own form with the bat, scoring 185 in three innings (only eight short of Taylor - the leading run-scorer of the series so far). In two out of three fixtures so far, the highly-touted limited-overs opener Alex Hales has managed stroke-filled starts but has failed to consolidate. His opening partner, Jason Roy, however, has impressed with two fifties. The middle-order pairing of Morgan and Taylor is in fine nick while Ben Stokes has displayed his ability to attract a lot of Aussie focus onto himself - willfully or otherwise. In the bowling department, leg-break bowler, Adil Rashid has led the proceedings for the hosts with seven wickets so far - just one short of leading wicket-taker Pat Cummins. England's ploy of playing a second spinning option in Moeen Ali has also paid off as the off-spinner has bagged four wickets and tested the Aussie batters on several occasions. With Chris Woakes ruled out due to thigh injury, it will be interesting to see who takes his spot in the pace department alongside Steven Finn and Liam Plunkett. Mark Wood, who was dropped after the first ODI, could return to the side. The think-tank could also consider bringing in left-arm medium-pacer David Wiley.Probable XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan (c), Ben Stokes, Jonathan Bairstow (wk), Moeen Ali, Liam Plunkett, Mark Wood, Adil Rashid, Steven Finn Australia:With two clinical victories under their belt, Australia has been the far better side in the limited-overs series so far. Their loss in Manchester was by a massive margin but Friday's game provides another opportunity to seal the series before it heads to the finale. Australia endured a rare middle-order failure when none of Steven Smith, George Bailey or Mitchell Marsh could convert their good starts into match-winning knocks in Manchester. Smith, however, will be delighted by Aaron Finch's successful return to the side. The leader of the bowling attack, Mitchell Starc, too, experienced an off day in the third ODI, conceding 79 runs in 10 overs and will aim to swiftly make amends. James Pattinson took Nathan Coulter-Nile's spot but returned with figures of none for 36 in six overs. The former, however, could be expected to hold down his spot for one more game before the management reverts to Coulter-Nile. The onus of taking wickets rests on the young shoulders of Pat Cummins, who leads the bowling chart in the series so far. In the spin contingent, Ashton Agar, who made his debut in Manchester, is expected to get another game.Probable XI: Joe Burns, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith (c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade (wk), Ashton Agar, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, James PattinsonTeams:Australia (From): Joe Burns, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), Ashton Agar, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, James Pattinson, Marcus Stoinis, Peter Handscomb, John HastingsEngland (From): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jonathan Bairstow(w), Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Steven Finn, Mark Wood, Sam BillingsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
