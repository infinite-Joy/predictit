I believe every Indian will remember that match. Harris will open the bowlingAccording to the D/L method, the target for India is 218, which means that only one run more has been added to the target.Vinay Kumar jolted the Australian top order with some quick wickets as Australia got off to a slow start.

The pitch looks dry and there might be some turn. I watched the T20 games and there are some good players in the team. I hope the team carries the good form in this series. We need to play some good cricket. Matthew Wade and Dan Christian are playing today.Dhoni: We will bowl first as the wicket looks good. The sides have chased down well at this ground. We need to restrict Australia to a low score. Sehwag has been rested. It is important to do well and we need to do the basics correctly.India have won the toss and elected to fieldMore news coming in: Virender Sehwag might miss this match due to injury. Rohit Sharma could play in this match. However, we are awaiting official confirmation.Just in: Brett Lee, who was in top form during the Big Bash final bowling constantly in excess of 145 kmph has been ruled out of the CB series with a broken foot. He is doubtful for the West Indies ODI series as well. That's bad news for Australia.Pitch report: Ian Chappell has the honors today of doing the pitch report and he reckons that it is a typical Australian wicket - pretty hard and with a fair amount of grass. It may slow down later on in the evening and there are chances of rain as well as the day goes on.A warm welcome to the opening game of the CB series between Australia and India at the MCG. There is rain forecast for later in the evening but as of now the conditions look fine for some cricket. India registered their first win of the tour a couple of days back and look a vastly different side in the shorter formats. Do stay tuned for the toss and the teams.Preview by Saurabh SomaniThe victory in the second T20 couldn't have come at a better time for team India, who seemed to have forgotten the art of winning a game abroad. That win, however, is sure to give the team some of the lost confidence back, and means that the upcoming tri-series will not have one team that is completely down and out. The spectators can thus expect a well-fought series after the disappointingly one-sided Test matches, when Australia and India take on each other in the first match.IndiaThe Indians will be a mightily relieved lot after putting a win up on their erstwhile blank score-board, but the cobwebs are far from cleared. They are back to playing the format that they seem the strongest in currently, so that will be of some comfort - but more than the physical skills, it will be the mental scars of continuous defeat that need to heal quickly. That they hadn't yet gone completely was evident in the Twenty20 that the team won, with the chase being a nervy affair till the end. However, the important point was that the team did win, and can hope that the victory will mark the turning of a corner.India's selection of the final eleven is likely to cause some headaches with the re-entry of Sachin Tendulkar in coloured clothing. They had so far gone in with five batsmen, Dhoni, the all-rounder in Jadeja, and four bowlers for the two Twenty20s. Of the five batsmen - Sehwag, Gambhir, Kohli, Raina and Rohit - none seem droppable, which means either Jadeja or one of the bowlers will have to make way. None of those options are ideal, and maybe the team management will decide to drop a batsman, but it is a tricky call. The man to sit on the bench could well be Ravindra Jadeja - star of India's only win on tour and recent IPL millionaire - which would be a harsh call on the youngster.AustraliaAfter selecting a team filled with rookies for the Twenty20 matches, Australia are back with the familiar faces for the tri-series. The bowling attack looks considerably altered from the one that terrorized India in the Tests, but in Clarke, Ponting and Hussey - the core of the batting has returned. The Australians will be feeling on a high overall, with the recent successes they have enjoyed in spite of the format being different. Not that they have done badly in ODIs - they are in fact ranked Number One in the world still. One change from the Test squad that will be welcomed is the inclusion of Matthew Wade - who had two fine knocks in the Twenty20s and looks a better bet right now than the struggling Haddin.Australia's attack should be led by Brett Lee and Ryan Harris, but whether Mitchell Starc or Clint McKay is the third seamer remains to be seen. In David Hussey and Daniel Christian, they also have a couple of hard-hitting all-rounders, who will lend depth to the batting and add options to the bowling, while David Warner at the top is as destructive as they come. Christian and Hussey though, will want to make most of the opportunity they have before Shane Watson returns.Final WordThis is the opening match of the series, and both teams will therefore have plenty of opportunities later in the tournament if they lose this. Nevertheless, it is vital from both teams' point of view, to start with a win. Australia will not want to break their momentum after a successful summer, while India need a victory to firmly establish a fresh start after their recent losses.Teams:India (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Gautam Gambhir, Ravindra Jadeja, Zaheer Khan, Virat Kohli, Praveen Kumar, Parthiv Patel, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, Virender Sehwag, Rohit Sharma, Rahul Sharma, Sachin Tendulkar, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay Kumar, Umesh YadavAustralia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Daniel Christian, Xavier Doherty, Peter Forrest, Ryan Harris, David Hussey, Michael Hussey, Brett Lee, Clint McKay, Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc, Ricky Ponting, Matthew Wade(w), David WarnerLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
