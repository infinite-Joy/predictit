Malinga will open the attackWe are all set for the first ball, few dark clouds hovering around the stadium....Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith MalingaEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, James Anderson, Harry GurneySri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldHello and welcome to the first ODI at the Oval. Sri Lanka started off the tour well with a win in the only T20 game. That and the return of the senior players like Mahela and Sanga should give them the confidence. England have a lot of work to do. The new team management is still working on getting the right combination. They too will bolstered by the return of their premier bowler, James Anderson. With the World Cup less than a year away, these matches will serve as a rehersal for the main tournament. Stay tuned as we bring you the toss and team compositions....Preview: The five-match ODI series is bound to be seen as the start of the preparation for the World Cup in Australia early in 2015. With less than a year to go, both England and Sri Lanka will try to look at as many options before they finalise on the right men.England:The new set-up under Peter Moores will be severely tested straight up as they take on a team that has not lost an ODI all year. England will begin their "new era" in the absence of Kevin Pietersen and Jonathan Trott in the batting line-up. Those two have been key performers and will definitely be missed. However, despite their absence, England have a lot of quality in the batting department. Alastair Cook and Ian Bell will be expected to give them a solid platform. Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler and Joe Root, between them, contain a healthy mix of youthful exuberance and the wisdom of experience.The bowling department will feel the pinch of missing out Graeme Swann but will look to start well in familiar conditions. James Tredwell is expected to be the lead spinner and James Anderson will spearhead the pace attack. Tim Bresnan fills in the all-rounder slot in the absence of the injured Stuart Broad. England will be looking for the bowling unit to gain some confidence before they zero in on the right personnel for the future.Sri Lanka:The tourists will be high on confidence after clinching the lone T20I at The Oval. Playing the first ODI at the same venue will come in handy. Having won the Asia Cup just before their T20 WC triumph, the Lankans have been in great form in limited overs cricket in recent times. The batting unit will be led by the old guard - Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan. The trio will have to be backed up by Angelo Mathews, who seems to have turned a curve in batting in ODIs. Captaincy has sat well with the all-rounder whose personal form has flourished with the added responsibility. It also presents an ideal chance for Sri Lanka to test out which of the younger lot adapt to the foreign conditions and come good in terms of temperament.Sri Lanka's bowling, as always, contains a lot of flair with Lasith Malinga leading the way. Nuwan Kulasekara could be a very important member as well with his talent in swinging the new ball. Ajantha Mendis' mystery spin could also be a lethal weapon against the English batsmen.Quotes:We just want to get out there and play some cricket, and start whatever's going to happen, the journey of the next year or so - Alastair Cook can't wait to start with the 'new era.'We are most concerned with how we perform in English conditions to meet the challenge - Marvan Atappatu, the Sri Lanka coach, has his focus affixed on the task at handTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Chaturanga de Silva, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Thisara Perera, Ashan Priyanjan, Sachithra Senanayake, Mahela Jayawardene, Kushal Janith Perera, Lasith Malinga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara, Dhammika PrasadEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jos Buttler(w), Eoin Morgan, Chris Woakes, James Tredwell, Joe Root, Chris Jordan, Harry Gurney, Michael Carberry, Tim Bresnan, Ravi Bopara, Ian Bell, James Anderson, Gary BallanceLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
