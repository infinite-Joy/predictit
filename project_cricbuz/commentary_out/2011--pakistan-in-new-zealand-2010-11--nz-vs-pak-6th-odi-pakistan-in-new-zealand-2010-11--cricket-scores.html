There is a some moisture in this wicket and the ball will seam around at the start. There is a good grass covering and the pitch is looking hard. It is a good decision to bowl first.Taylor: It is a good wicket and we look forward to batting first. Oram misses out and Woodcock comes into the team. Southee also makes a comeback. It does not help when injuries plague the squad, but it is important to win. I am quite happy with the form that I showed in the previous game. It is important to win this game and sustain momentum for the World Cup. Bennett has been outstanding in this series.Afridi: The pitch is different and the boys are feeling a lot confident. Misbah and Riaz are resting. We have won the series, but we need to win this game to ensure momentum.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to fieldHello and Welcome to the final match of the New Zealand summer between the Kiwis and Pakistan. It has been a wonderful comeback from Pakistan after their thrashing in the first ODI at Wellington. Both the batsmen and bowlers have helped the team bounce back in style and have built serious momentum for the World Cup. Pakistan will be looking to end their tour on a high with a victory at Auckland. New Zealand, on the other hand, continue to find victory elusive. After breaking their losing streak in the first ODI, they have gone back to their losing ways and have succumbed to another series defeat. New Zealand will be looking to end their summer on a high and salvage some pride with victory in the final ODI today. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates....Preview by Karthik LakshmananPakistan's tour of New Zealand was touted as the 'Redemption series'. Pakistan had last won an ODI series in November 2008, and New Zealand had just come out of a horror tour to the sub continent. Now, after 2 Tests and 5 ODIs, the home Team still searches for redemption, while the visitors have done more than redeem themselves.
You can never doubt Pakistan's potential. For a team that boasts of a batting line up with Abdur Razzaq at No.8, and bowlers like Umar Gul, Wahab Riaz and Shahid Afridi, they had severely underperformed over the last two years. More than anything, the tour of New Zealand has made Pakistan realise how dangerous they can be in this format of the game. After what seems like ages, everything is going right for Pakistan. Both their openers have scored tons, the middle order has a solid batsman in the name of Misbah Ul Haq, and the lower order consists of 2 all rounders who would walk into any team in the World - Afridi and Razzaq. With captaincy issues settled and a series win in the bag, Pakistan would want to cap off their tour on a high.
New Zealand, on the other hand, have gone from bad to worse. After a whitewash in Bangladesh and India, the home series against Pakistan was their best chance to gain some winning momentum ahead of the World Cup. But their downward slide has continued. While their bowlers have done reasonably well, their batsmen have let them down. Martin Guptill and Ross Taylor have got starts but failed to convert them into match winning knocks, Jesse Ryder has struggled with injury and form, and Brendon McCullum doesn't seem dangerous down the order. With only one match to go before the World Cup, New Zealand would hope to give themselves something to cheer about before getting on the flight to India.Team news: Pakistan: With the series already won, Pakistan might look to test their bench strength. Saeed Ajmal, who may play a big part in the World Cup, may get a game tomorrow.New Zealand: The kiwis would be hoping for Vettori to recover in time for the final game.What they say.."It doesn't make a difference whether Misbah leads the side or I lead the side because we both are playing for our country": Shahid Afridi"At the moment we are getting ourselves into a good position and not capitalising. The batters can take a good look at the way the Pakistanis have played.": Ross TaylorTeams:New Zealand (From): Jesse Ryder, Martin Guptill, Jamie How, Ross Taylor(c), Scott Styris, Brendon McCullum(w), James Franklin, Jacob Oram, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Tim Southee, Kane Williamson, Hamish Bennett, Luke Woodcock, Daniel VettoriPakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Shoaib Akhtar, Abdur Rehman, Asad Shafiq, Saeed Ajmal, Tanvir Ahmed, Sohail TanvirLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
