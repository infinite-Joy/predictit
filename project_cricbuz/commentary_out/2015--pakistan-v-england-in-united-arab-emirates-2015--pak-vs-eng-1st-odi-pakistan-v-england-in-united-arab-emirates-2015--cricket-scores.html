PAKISTAN:24.2 Moeen Ali to Shoaib Malik, out Caught by Jason Roy!! Something happened. Oh yes. Malik's trudging off. Seemed so impassive. That's as soft a dismissal as they come. Flatter delivery on the stumps, Malik tucks it in the air and straight to short mid-wicket. Can't work out how he made the error really. Might have been early into the stroke and well in front of the body. But the bottom line is that England have an opening.

PAKISTAN:17.3 Adil Rashid to Hafeez, no run, teased up around off, Hafeez pushes to short cover
PAKISTAN:17.2 Adil Rashid to Hafeez, FOUR, that should have been stopped. Moeen Ali does all the hard work by making good ground, seems like his knee got stuck in the turf while diving, and the ball sneaks through to the ropes
PAKISTAN:17.1 Adil Rashid to Hafeez, 2 runs, did I see a different release from Rashid? Seemed to be released much quicker out of the front of the palm. Hafeez was down the track making some room as well, drives crisply through the covers. Two for the taking before deep cover tidies up

Was in the mid-70s right through the TestsDrinks are on the field now! For those who missed, Younis Khan's swansong is over. The veteran came out to a standing ovation, and a few minutes later walked back to one. Looked nervy right through. Topley got the new ball to swerve in the air early on and was rewarded with 3 early blows. Over to these veterans now. Rashid to continue

PAKISTAN:3.4 Topley to Younis Khan, no run, brilliant bowling. Inswing, inswing and now slanted away. Younis chases with his hands and no feet. Beaten on the outside edge

PAKISTAN:3.2 Topley to Bilal Asif, out Lbw!! What a shambolic attempted defence. Certainly not equipped to play the swinging ball. Short of length delivery which veers back in sharply after pitching in line with middle-stump, skids on and doesn't bounce as much. Bilal is playing for the straight one. Beaten on the inside edge by a huge way and struck on the knee-roll. OUT. Younis Khan for his final ODI innings now. Bilal Asif lbw b Topley 2(7)Topley to Bilal Asif, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Topley appeals, and appeals, now down on his haunches. Raise the finger. No. Have to go for the review. Misses bat by a mile, HawkEye shows it would have hit off stump high up.

PAKISTAN:1.5 Topley to Azhar Ali, out Lbw!! That's plumb in front. Don't tell me Azhar Ali is going to review this. He is having a chat with his partner for the review, so that's a sign that he's not hit this. No captain, please don't waste the review and thankfully he doesn't. England get the early wicket they wanted. Nothing but a full ball swinging back in, Azhar Ali plants his front foot across the line and tries to work it on the on-side, misses and the ball hits him right in front of middle and off. In fact that is the first ODI wicket for Topley. Azhar Ali lbw b Topley 8(10) [4s-2]Topley to Azhar Ali, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!

PAKISTAN:0.1 Willey to Azhar Ali, FOUR, off the mark in grand style. Full and swinging back in, the line was slightly down the leg-side, Azhar Ali clips it uppishly to the right of square leg and it runs away for fourTwo slips in place.Azhar Ali and Bilal Asif are at the crease. Azhar Ali is on strike. Willey will open the attackAll set for the chase. What will be the approach? Bang, bang or block, block? The sensible thing obviously would be to find a middle path and keep the strike rotating18:47 Local Time, 14:47 GMT, 20:17 IST: I just have this funny feeling that we might not have seen the last of it. The wicket is very sluggish and Pakistan will have to bat well to overhaul what looks a modest total. The new ball should be the best time to bat on. And that's where England got it wrong. Three wickets to the pace bowlers when the ball isn't misbehaving much at all. What were they doing? Anyway, Morgan got together with a very busy Taylor to build. They were involved in an excellent partnership showing no evidence of any discomfort. Very impressive stuff from both of them who were magnificent in their own right flowing to their respective half-centuries. But once Pakistan broke through the duo, England never really recovered. Lost the last 7 wickets for a meagre 69 runs. These uncanny low totals. Have a tendency to clutter the chasing team's approach. Let's see how it goes. Back in around 30 minutes..4
ENGLAND:49.4 Riaz to Topley, out Woakes Run Out!! That's the end of that. England finish with 216. Woakes actually played a handy knock to get them here. Tries to sneak in a bye after Topley missed, had to get on strike to be fair on him, just inches short of the crease after Sarfraz effects a direct-hit with an underarm effort. Woakes run out (Sarfraz Ahmed) 33(49) [4s-1]Riaz to Topley, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!

ENGLAND:48.3 Irfan to Willey, out Bowled!! Bingo! Actually was the most hittable ball of the over. Length and right in the slot to be whacked, Willey has an almighty heave at it, doesn't bounce as much as he thought, whizzes beneath the inside edge to clatter off-stump. Willey b Irfan 13(24)Irfan to Willey, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!

ENGLAND:47.1 Riaz to Woakes, no run, another lovely yorker from Riaz, Woakes digs it out off the bottom of the bat, then bounces on the pitch before settling in Sarfraz's glovesWe have gone upstairs for a caught-behind appeal. Basically to check whether it's a bump ball or not. Oh yes, sure is! NOT OUT
ENGLAND:46.6 Anwar Ali to Willey, no run, no pace whatsoever, the batsmen are struggling to get the bowling away. On a good length just outside off, Willey aims inside out with an expansive drive but ends up dragging it back towards the bowler off a thick inside edge
ENGLAND:46.5 Anwar Ali to Willey, no run, length ball slanted across, cracked straight to short cover
ENGLAND:46.4 Anwar Ali to Willey, no run, Willey loads up for a good 'ol mow across the line to a good length delivery, it just doesn't get up from the pitch, scoots under the inside edge on the bounce to the keeper

ENGLAND:45.5 Riaz to Willey, 1 run, brilliant bowling at the death. Oopsy, has Riaz done something to his ankle! Looks in some discomfort. Yorker dug out on the crease, the batsmen set off, so does Riaz and aims a kick onto the stumps, all he does is roll his ankle over the ball. Won't make a good footballer. He lays on the ground for some time prompting Waqar to point at his watch. Get on with it
ENGLAND:45.4 Riaz to Woakes, 1 run, Woakes had given up and would have been on his bike with a direct hit! Pushed to cover and sets off, the fielder collects and shies at the non-striker's end but can't hit bull's eye
ENGLAND:45.3 Riaz to Woakes, no run, so slow this surface is. Banged in halfway, Woakes is surprised by the tennis ball bounce as it gets too big on him. The lack of pace allows him to thrust his head out of the way in time
ENGLAND:45.2 Riaz to Woakes, 2 runs, the backward point fielder rushes in looking to prevent the single, ends up missing the ball altogether leaking an extra run. Sloppy. Woakes had dropped it with soft hands and the batsmen pushed hard inducing the misfieldSwitches to round the wicket for the right hander..

ENGLAND:44.4 Irfan to Woakes, 2 runs, driven straight back down the pitch, no way Irfan is bending his 7 foot frame, uses his feet to stop but all he does is kick it away wide of mid-on who was left wrong-footed originally moving in the opposite direction
ENGLAND:44.3 Irfan to Woakes, no run, that angle is proving a menace in these final overs. Woakes feels he has it covered on the drive but no. Beats him
ENGLAND:44.2 Irfan to Woakes, 2 runs, full and angling away, Woakes drives away from the body with no feet and slices it off a thick edge. Third man has a lot of work to do and the batsmen are back for the second
ENGLAND:44.1 Irfan to Willey, 1 run, oooh, Willey was winding up for a booming drive. Fairly full delivery just outside off, he goes with hard hands but only manages a thick inside edge behind square

ENGLAND:43.4 Yasir Shah to Willey, no run, drifting with the arm across off, beats the outside edge of Willey who was playing for some turn

ENGLAND:41.6 Riaz to Willey, no run, oh no! Willey is hit near the stomach and he's feeling the pain. I think it hit the ribcage as well. He's down on the ground and quickly calls for the physio.

ENGLAND:9.4 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, let me tell you, this was no half-volley. Just a fraction full outside off, might have been the cutter, Morgan gets a good stride into the ball and creams the cover drive piercing the off-side field
ENGLAND:9.3 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, the back of a length off-cutter, Morgan picks it early and defends off the back foot
ENGLAND:9.2 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, slightly short, enough width, Morgan chops it off a thick inside edge back towards the keeper. Has fluffed his cut plenty of times already
ENGLAND:9.1 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, down the track and bang! Last over of the first powerplay and Morgan looking to make use. Anwar Ali is medium pace at best so not much of a risk. Length ball angled across off, Morgan leaves enough room to swing his arms, and hammers it over mid-on on the up
ENGLAND:8.6 Shoaib Malik to James Taylor, no run, Taylor skips down, gets close to the pitch of this quickish delivery and clips it to short mid-wicket
ENGLAND:8.5 Shoaib Malik to Eoin Morgan, 1 run, floated up on this occasion, Morgan eases the push down to long-off, Malik tries to stop the ball but too far away
ENGLAND:8.4 Shoaib Malik to Eoin Morgan, no run, bit slower through the air compared to his previous balls, a hint of spin as well from a length on off, Morgan opens the bat face slightly after moving half-forward to defend into the off-side
ENGLAND:8.3 Shoaib Malik to Eoin Morgan, no run, "darting them in," says Bumble on air. Very quick on the stumps, Morgan is circumspect on the back foot
ENGLAND:8.2 Shoaib Malik to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, darted onto the pads, Morgan sinks low on one knee and shovels the sweep behind square. Rockets away to the fence
ENGLAND:8.1 Shoaib Malik to Eoin Morgan, no run, oh dear! Just the ninth over and look at that. Doesn't bode well. Pushed quicker and flatter from round the wicket, Morgan is committed to the back foot, the ball just refuses to get up from the pitch, does well to get his bat down low and keep it outShoaib Malik, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
ENGLAND:7.6 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, leg byes, 1 run, might have rolled his fingers across this one, the off-cutter was delivered on a back of a length down leg, Morgan is kept waiting on his glance. Finally, ends up missing it and the ball dribbles away off the pads behind square
ENGLAND:7.5 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, on a length and angled across the left-hander, Morgan forces forward into the push towards cover
ENGLAND:7.4 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, a very full off-cutter, Morgan squeezes the drive to mid-off
ENGLAND:7.3 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, pulls his length further back, the line is on off, Morgan gets his back foot defence off the inside half of the bat to mid-on
ENGLAND:7.2 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, Morgan would have been very worried when he hit that. Goes threateningly in the air, and teasingly wide of a scrambling mid-wicket fielder. Back of a length delivery on leg, perhaps stops in the pitch due to which he was early into the tuck, scoops it up but wide of the outstretched hands of the fielder
ENGLAND:7.1 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, on a back of a length around the fourth stump, Morgan gets right behind the line to offer a straight bat
ENGLAND:6.6 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, short of length delivery in the channel, solidly done off the back foot
ENGLAND:6.5 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, weeee! Comes out completely wrong from the hand. Beamer, luckily the line is outside off, Taylor is startled but throws his bat at it anyway. Misses
ENGLAND:6.4 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, opts for the much conventional option on this occasion, raises his arms nice and high to leave
ENGLAND:6.3 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, jumping over to off, awkward way to fend at a short of length delivery leaving him, the bat face turns while he was at it, takes his bottom hand off and drops it on the pitch
ENGLAND:6.2 Irfan to Eoin Morgan, 1 run, short of length delivery on the hips, Morgan hops and works it wide of mid-on
ENGLAND:6.1 Irfan to Eoin Morgan, 2 runs, yes, Morgan will get a fair share of these. Bouncer aimed at the badge, Morgan anticipates and moves into position early, controls the pull behind square by rolling his wrists on top of the ball. Fine leg moves across and slides to stop
ENGLAND:5.6 Anwar Ali to James Taylor, no run, again the bottom hand coming into play, length ball on middle and off, he turns it gently to the on-side
ENGLAND:5.5 Anwar Ali to James Taylor, FOUR, nice turn of the wrists. Fuller length delivery but erring in line, Taylor leans forward, meets it well in front of the body, not the ideal way to play. Where he did well was to roll the wrists on the ball to send it through along the turf through mid-wicket. Skims away
ENGLAND:5.4 Anwar Ali to James Taylor, no run, full around off, driven firmly back down the pitch, Anwar makes a half-stop preventing a certain boundary
ENGLAND:5.3 Anwar Ali to James Taylor, no run, pitched fuller around off, Taylor moves across and works it firmly to the right of mid-on. The fielder hurries across to field
ENGLAND:5.2 Anwar Ali to James Taylor, no run, Taylor's head nearly fell over, was angled in on a length on middle, he does well to offer a straight bat in defence to keep it out. Might have been in trouble if he looked to close the face
ENGLAND:5.1 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, 1 run, slightly short but again not much bounce from the pitch, Morgan chops it behind backward point off a thick inside edge while looking to cut
ENGLAND:4.6 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, short of length delivery angled across off, jumps in the crease to and blocks it towards cover
ENGLAND:4.5 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, pitches it further up invitingly, Taylor is drawn forward, drives firmly to the left of mid-on who sprints across and stops with a dive
ENGLAND:4.4 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, almost a carbon copy of the previous delivery, Taylor is fairly comfortable to keep it out on the back foot
ENGLAND:4.3 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, slightly behind a length around off, Taylor hops and blocks
ENGLAND:4.2 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, short of length delivery cramping Taylor for room as he was looking to cut, checks his shot to cover-point. Meanwhile, Irfan issued an official warning for running on the deck
ENGLAND:4.1 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, a tad full on off, Taylor trots forward and presents the full face of the bat to drive to mid-off
ENGLAND:3.6 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, back of a length delivery around off, punched to mid-off
ENGLAND:3.5 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, gets this one away! Similar line, similar length, Morgan wasn't going to miss out on this occasion. Crunches it in front of square and whistles away
ENGLAND:3.4 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, back of a length and wide of off, the width was there but maybe the lack of bounce messes up the timing of Morgan's cut. Chops it straight to backward point
ENGLAND:3.3 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, pushed across Morgan on a length, the English skipper wants a moment of calmness now. Enough of the craziness. Shoulders arms
ENGLAND:3.2 Anwar Ali to James Taylor, 1 run, angling into the pads on a length, Taylor is away with a neat flick down to fine legJames Taylor, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:3.1 Anwar Ali to Hales, out Caught by Younis Khan!! My oh my! What on this good Earth is going on. It's pace doing all the damage. Back of a length delivery around the fifth stump line, did nothing off the deck, nothing that I could spot anyway. Hales rocks back and aims a firm punch through the covers, just played down the wrong line as simple as that. Gets a thick edge which dips to the left of Younis. The oldie has still got it, moves smartly, fumbles the first time but hangs on for dear life as it didn't pop up too far. Then a boyish smile after being mobbed by his mates. Hales c Younis Khan b Anwar Ali 10(7) [4s-1]Anwar Ali to Hales, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
ENGLAND:2.6 Irfan to Eoin Morgan, FOUR, lobs up and just over the keeper. This is a very nervy start. Short of length on the body, Morgan was expecting this, but is through the pull too early. Catches him on the fore-arm and spoons over the leaping keeper. Umpire didn't spot it and gave runs
ENGLAND:2.5 Irfan to Eoin Morgan, no run, Morgan is sitting back here. Fairly full, Morgan hangs back and offers a straight bat. Any movement and he was in trouble
ENGLAND:2.4 Irfan to Hales, 3 runs, on a length on the pads, Hales picks it off through mid-wicket. Didn't have a lot of power behind it and the ball is chased down
ENGLAND:2.3 Irfan to Hales, no run, straightish on this occasion, length is full, Hales gently clips it towards mid-wicket
ENGLAND:2.2 Irfan to Hales, no run, continuously pegging away on a short of length, this one is slanting away wide of off, Hales looks to cut but only finds the toe-end of the bat through to the keeper on the bounce
ENGLAND:2.1 Irfan to Hales, no run, short of length delivery on off, Hales leaves it on length, didn't cover his stumps and the ball safely bounces over the top
ENGLAND:1.6 Anwar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, leaving Morgan on a length, left aloneEoin Morgan, left handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:1.5 Anwar Ali to Root, out Lbw!! What a start this is. First Roy, and now the dangerous Joe Root. His reluctance to come forward ends up costing big time. A good length delivery pitching around off and jagging back a fair degree, Root was pinned on the crease aiming a push to mid-on with a straight bat, the movement beats the inside edge and hits the flap of the front pad. And England lose their sole review as well. Was more in hope rather than anything else. Not very smart. Root lbw b Anwar Ali 0(7)Anwar Ali to Root, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Root has been pinned LBW. He however wants a second look. His reaction didn't suggest an inside edge as he looked nervously at his partner. No, no bat. The only question appears to be height. No chance I would say on this sluggish pitch. Yes, clipping the top of leg.
ENGLAND:1.4 Anwar Ali to Root, no run, fraction fuller on a similar line, forward with a firm push to mid-off
ENGLAND:1.3 Anwar Ali to Root, no run, back of a length delivery in the channel, Root hangs back and punches to cover
ENGLAND:1.2 Anwar Ali to Hales, 3 runs, stiff start from Ali. Labouring into the crease, strays on the pads, Hales clips it behind square. Irfan, at fine leg, has a lot of ground to cover. Not ideal after bowling an over. Does well and bends low to stop
ENGLAND:1.1 Anwar Ali to Hales, FOUR, full, too full. Hales leans into the drive, not much feet, cracks it straight of mid-on. The fielder gives chase but doesn't have a cat in a hell's chance on this outfieldAnwar Ali, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
ENGLAND:0.6 Irfan to Root, no run, hitting the pitch again, Root moves back and across and steers to point. Ideal start for the hosts
ENGLAND:0.5 Irfan to Root, no run, testing stuff. Angling away on a similar short of length, Root pokes away from the body, the ball leaves him with the angle and beats the edge
ENGLAND:0.4 Irfan to Root, no run, short of length delivery at off-stump, Root rises on his toes and drops it beside the pitch with soft hands
ENGLAND:0.3 Irfan to Root, no run, overpitched in the channel outside off, Root is chained to the crease and only goes with his hands attempting a limp drive, mistimes it to cover-pointJoe Root, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:0.2 Irfan to Jason Roy, out Bowled!! Boom. Irfan crashes timber with his second ball! And what a ball. Delivered on a good length and angled across from over the wicket, the ball pitches in line with middle and leg stump and straightens a shade, enough to go right through the gate of Roy who had committed on the drive, never in balance as he was on the walk. Goes on to knock over the top of off. Jason Roy b Irfan 0(2)Irfan to Jason Roy, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
ENGLAND:0.1 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, right up there just outside off, Roy is slow in leaning into the drive, only manages a thick inside edge onto padJason Roy and Hales are at the crease. Jason Roy is on strike. Irfan will open the attackPakistan are trotting out onto the field in their eye-catching parrot greens. Out come the English openers in Jason Roy as Alex Hales. The seven-footer Mohammad Irfan is at the top of his mark and rehearsing his action. They are now showing footage of Younis Khan being given a guard of honour by his teammates when he walked out. Okay, on we go..A translated transcript of Younis Khan's interview by Ramiz Raja, "I have waited for the last 7-8 months. I feel that players like me should bow out with honour. Not a sudden decision. Was thinking about it for those 7-8 months. In 2011, I started contemplating about leaving after a good series but didn't get an opportunity as such. We have lads likes Rizwan, who can easily replace me. Gave out vibes in our last team meeting. Those close to me had a fair idea. I'm very proud that you picked me for this team when you were in the PCB. What an honour it was to share the dressing room with the likes of Wasim Akram, Moin Khan on debut. I kept playing my way right through shutting out all the negativities. I thank all my friends and colleagues. Don't want to be recognized as a leading run-scorer or something like that, but as a pure Pakistani and a team-man."TeamsPakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Bilal Asif, Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik, Babar Azam, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Mohammad IrfanEngland (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Reece TopleyThose who watched the toss closely on TV must have noticed a poppy on Morgan's collar. Every Englishman would be sporting it today to mark Armistice Day.Azhar: "He has been a tremendous role model for us (talking about Younis). We want to win this one for him. The track looks very good and we also wanted to bat first. We'll look to restrict England to a low total. Just one change from the warm-up game, Ahmed (Shehzad) is not playing and is replaced by Bilal (Asif)."Morgan: "We are going to have a bat. Looks pretty good (the pitch, what else). Nice reasonable covering of grass and some cracks. Hopefully, it plays well. It's a new look team. This series presents a different challenge which hopefully we will overcome. Same team as the warm-up game."England have won the toss and have opted to batAll set for the toss.."Very dry looking surface here, very little dry grass. Hard work for the seamers who would be looking for reverse as soon as possible with the abrasiveness on offer. Plenty in it for the spinners. Batsmen gotta be greedy today. When you come in, won't be easy to get going straightaway," opines Nick Knight in the pitch report14:20 Local Time, 10:20 GMT, 15:50 IST: Actually, both Englishmen spoken off below are fighting their own battles. Morgan was left concussed by a Mitchell Starc bouncer and spoke extensively about his physical state in the lead-up. Should be a mental test of character in how he braces himself for some sure-shot chin music. Buttler, on the other hand, is in the middle of a shocking phase. Was 'rested' midway through the ODI series against Australia and dropped for the final Test here. Has the full backing of his skipper though.14:10 Local Time, 10:10 GMT, 15:40 IST: Live pictures coming in from the stadium and as expected, not a cloud on the horizon. We are done and dusted with a very one-sided Test series and now time to move on. Will be a completely different contest. All England need to do is look back at their previous tour here. Whitewashed in Tests, they returned the favour back with aplomb in the 50-over format. A completely new-look to their lineup which is led by Eoin Morgan. With 151 ODI caps, he is the most experienced player only followed by his vice-captain Jos Buttler with 61. These numbers are glaring.14:00 Local Time, 10:00 GMT, 15:30 IST: Good afternoon folks. Let me get straight to the big news coming in. Younis Khan has decided to hang up his boots in the ODI format. Today will be his final ODI. Not a big surprise to be honest. He didn't feature in the team post World Cup. There was pre-series talk of him wanting to leave on a high. And here it is. Hasn't been in the best of touch in coloured clothing with just one ton in over 7 years. A wise move to prolong his Test career if you ask me. All those in the vicinity, drop by at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, catch a glimpse of the man before he wanders off into the sunset. Preview Pakistan and England last squared off in a One-Day International (ODI) back in 2012. Since then, both sides have grappled with limited success in the format, particularly in the multi-team events and where they have found themselves often languishing in the middle of the rankings table; 2015, however, has been an eye-opener for both the sides. Following another unflattering World Cup campaign, both teams have adopted a positive brand of cricket with special emphasis on youth.Pakistan, under Azhar Ali, bounced back from the ignominy of a 3-0 whitewash in Bangladesh to win the ODI series against Zimbabwe (home and away) and Sri Lanka (away). In the process, they just about sneaked above West Indies to the eighth spot in the ICC rankings, sealing qualification to the 2017 Champions Trophy.England, for so long a middling ODI side, have been given a fresh lease of life under Eoin Morgan. Since their debacle in Australia, they have run both the World Cup finalists - New Zealand (won 3-2) and Australia (lost 2-3) - close.Besides hosts England, seven other top-ranked sides as of September 30, 2017, will qualify directly for the ten-team World Cup in 2019. The only way Pakistan can move up the order is by winning matches against the higher-ranked sides. Pakistan, currently ranked eighth as compared to England's sixth, will be hoping they do not repeat their below-par performances that saw them get blanked 4-0 when these sides met in 2012."We know the importance of this series and have to do well to build the side for the future, especially with the Champions Trophy 2017, rankings and the 2019 World Cup all in the mind," Waqar Younis, Pakistan's head coach, said ahead of the series opener in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday (November 10). "We have shown good progress with some exciting youngsters."Once again, spin will be Pakistan's chief mode of attack against England. Yasir Shah comes into the series on the back of another impressive showing in Tests - 15 wickets from two games at 21.53. He will be ably assisted by Bilal Asif, whose action was cleared by ICC last week, and Shoaib Malik. Wahab Riaz and Mohamamd Irfan will lead the pace attack that also has the likes of Rahat Ali and Anwar Ali.The return of Younis Khan is most anticipated as it could be the veteran's last ODI assignment. Younis is expected to slot into the No. 4 position and along with the in-form Shoaib Malik, should add experience and solidity to the middle-order, with youngsters Aamer Yamin and Mohammad Rizwan bringing in the flair.For the visitors, captain Morgan showed no visible signs of discomfort on his return to the field in the warm-up game against Hong Kong. He had suffered a mild concussion after being hit on the head by a Mitchell Starc bouncer in early September. With his ability to change the tempo of an ODI innings at will, Morgan serves as the crucial link between the top and the lower-middle orders in the England setup.England, however, will miss the services of the hard-hitting all-rounder Ben Stokes, who suffered a shoulder injury in the Dubai Test. Chris Jordan, who returns to the ODI squad for the first time after the series against New Zealand could be called upon to partner Chris Woakes and Reece Topley in a three-prong medium-pace attack with Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali taking up the spin duties.Both Pakistan and England have tuned up for the series-opener in Abu Dhabi with comfortable warm-up wins against Nepal and Hong Kong respectively. If the pitch plays anything like it did on the first four days of the Test match, the teams can brace themselves up for another high-scoring encounter.Teams:England (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Sam Billings, James Taylor, Chris Jordan, Reece TopleyPakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Azhar Ali(c), Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan, Mohammad Rizwan, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Wahab Riaz, Bilal Asif, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Irfan, Zafar Gohar, Anwar Ali, Babar Azam, Rahat Ali, Aamer YaminLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
