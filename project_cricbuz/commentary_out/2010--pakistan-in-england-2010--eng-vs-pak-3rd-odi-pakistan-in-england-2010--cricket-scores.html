However, it will be safe to associate these two terms with Pakistan, as their tour of England lurches from one disaster to another. After being clean-swept 2-0 in the T20s, they now face the prospect of going down the same line in the ODIs as England look to clinch the series at The Oval. Pakistan came close to winning the second ODI, but some calm thinking from the England lower order pushed them to a tense victory in a high scoring match. Pakistan's main problem has been all-round consistency. If the batting clicks, then the bowling misfires and vice versa. In fact, the only consistent factor with Pakistan has been their sloppy fielding. From the start of the tour, the Pakistani fielders have dropped numerous catches and given away plenty of cheap runs. In fact, such is the situation that whenever the ball comes near a Pakistani fielder, he is almost expected to misfield it. If Pakistan have to put up a fight, they must first take their catches and field well because as the saying "catches win matches". The batting has finally started to show some spark in the series. Kamran Akmal has been aggressive with at the top and he has gotten off the team to great starts. His good form, however, has not been complimented by others in the team. The middle order has stroked some well-made 30s or 40s but none have gone on and made the big score. It is this inability to convert starts that continues to plague the Pakistani batsmen. Asad Shafiq, who made his debut in the Asia Cup against Bangladesh, was the only other batsman who looked in good touch as he stroked a confident fifty. As far as the bowling is concerned, Pakistan have been clearly affected by the absence of Asif and Aamer. The bowling has looked weak and barring Akhtar and Ajmal, none of the other bowlers have stood up and delivered the goods. Umar Gul has struggled for rhythm ever since coming back from injury while the other two spinners, Hafeez and Shahid Afridi, have given away plenty of runs. Mohammad Irfan, the much talked about tall pace bowler, had a horror debut at Chester-le-street as he was unimpressive with the ball and in the field. England, on the other hand, have fewer problems in their setup. Their batting looks in wonderful touch with Strauss and Trott being the stars in the batting line-up. Trott has further enhanced his reputation and is making this summer his own. Steve Davies has been a wonderful addition to the England top order following Kieswetter's loss of form. His aggressive starts have given the other England batsmen plenty of confidence. The only weak link in the chain is the middle order. Morgan and Collingwood have not done much with the bat, but they have the ability to turn things around when given an opportunity. Michael Yardy, in the lower middle order, has been a revelation. His calm outlook and mature thinking have enabled him to get England over the line in close matches. He did it in both the T20s against Pakistan and again in a tense match at Leeds. The bowling looks alright, but they would have been a bit worried by the pasting that they have got in the first two ODIs. Bresnan and Broad will be particularly worried as they have given away the most number of runs in both these ODIs. Swann, Anderson and Yardy have been steady, with the spinners doing a decent job in the middle overs. England will be relying on these bowlers to put pressure on a Pakistani side that is desperate for a win.There is only one consolation for Pakistan as they play this match at The Oval. It is at this venue where they defeated England in the test match in August by 4 wickets and notched up a rare high point in their troubled summer. They will be looking for a similar result this time around on Friday.Teams:England (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Steve Davies(w), Jonathan Trott, Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Michael Yardy, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Luke Wright, Ryan Sidebottom, Ajmal ShahzadPakistan (From): Kamran Akmal(w), Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Yousuf, Asad Shafiq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Fawad Alam, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Irfan, Shahzaib Hasan, Azhar Ali, Abdul Razzaq, Wahab RiazLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
