ENGLAND:17.4  Seelaar to Pietersen, out Caught by Borren!! My word he has a problem against left-arm spinners and he has perished to that breed once again. All types of them have got him, from the best to the worst. He had done all the hard work and has thrown it away with a soft punch drive to short cover, he checked his drive and found the Dutch skipper take a sharp catch to his right.

ENGLAND:11.6  Westdijk to Strauss, FOUR!!, The only positive you can find from that ball was that it swung in the air, but only made it easier for Strauss to play his patented tuck off the pads, beating short fine, similar ball and similar shot, and a cry of anguish from Westdijk who clearly is not impressed with his efforts with those last two balls

ENGLAND:10.6  Loots to Strauss, FOUR!!, Terrific shot, short and wide outside off, Strauss had all the time to place his cut wide of sweeper cover, poor effort from the man there, he had to move a couple of yards to his left and he did not even put in a slide or a dive
ENGLAND:10.5  Loots to Strauss, 2 runs, Lots of confusion between the two and both the batsmen have a smile at each other after all that has happened, it was tucked to deep square, Strauss and Pietersen nearly collided with each other, it was a weak throw on the bounce and that allowed Strauss to make his ground, it was referred to the third umpire who conveyed the decision

ENGLAND:7.2  Westdijk to Pietersen, FOUR!!, If Westdijk had got his left hand to that he would have missed the rest of this WC, good that he did not, put his hand out and then saw the ferociousness of that off drive and bailed out, the ball sped away to the fence at the rate of knots as Ravi Shastri would say
ENGLAND:7.1  Westdijk to Pietersen, no run, good length and swung away a tad, Pietersen lets it go, the keeper standing up did well to collect

ENGLAND:6.5  Bukhari to Pietersen, 1 run, driven to mid off, who is at the edge of the circle, Pietersen was in even if the throw had hit the stumps, which it didn't

ENGLAND:3.2  Westdijk to Pietersen, FOUR!!, 2 in a row he won't miss, walks down the wicket and thumps the length ball on middle with a beautiful flick off the bat wide of square leg, the ball just raced across the outfield which has quickened under the night sky

ENGLAND:0.6  Bukhari to Strauss, FOUR!!, Strauss has come out with a positive intent to go after the bowling, those balls on the pads certainly help too, clipped to the right of short fine leg, and England have started off confidently, they needed that after all the poor work with the ball and in the field earlier on
ENGLAND:0.5  Bukhari to Strauss, no run, good diving stop to his left at backward point, square driven and the fielder saved some runs for his side

Borren has set an attacking field too, two slips await for Strauss as he flashed at a ball which was very full outside off and missed, it went under the bat and the keeper dived to his right to prevent any runsStrauss and Pietersen are at the crease. Strauss is on strike. Bukhari will open the attackRyan ten Doeschate: I was not very sure whether to go for the attack right from the start or leave it at the end. The deck is a very good one to bat on and I suppose we have posted a very challenging score, one which we feel can defend.Ryan ten Doeschate has improved upon his burgeoning reputation with an excellent innings here. Netherlands have gone about their batting rather professionally after having opted to bat first. Borren, their captain, played very sensibly and his neat cameo gave them the late flourish required. There was no help for the England bowlers from the track even as they toiled away in vain and the hapless fielding did not do them any good either. The bizzare and rather chaotic fielding in the end overs showed that England have been rattled by this score and their batsmen will have to be on top of their game when they come out to bat. Can Netherlands pull off an upset and give the associate nations something to cheer about? Join us shortly for what promises to be an exciting run chase.4
NETHERLANDS:49.6  Anderson to Bukhari, no run, a toe crushing yorker on the leg stump, Bukhari digs it back down the wicket, that's the end of it, they get 292 in the end.

LOL!

NETHERLANDS:11.4  Swann to Barresi, out Stumped!! How many times has Swann done this? Countless is the answer. A wicket in his first over. Draws Barresi forward with a beautifully tossed up delivery, it straightens outside off and Barresi's backfoot is on the line as he misses the ball, Prior is quick to whip the bails off and the third ump gives it out after a lot of replays. But the right decision and sloppy work from Barresi who should never have dragged his backfoot out of his crease. That is an elementary mistake. Barresi st Prior b Swann 29(25) [4s-6] Swann to Barresi, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!England have gone up for a stumping chance against Barresi. Prior looks to be very confident. Looks like his confidence is justified as Barresi's foot is on the line. Dharmasena is the TV umpire. He is having a lot of looks at the replays.

NETHERLANDS:8.3  Bresnan to Barresi, no run, nasty, nasty short delivery and Barresi almost had his head blown away, but he did well in the end to sway out of the way, it was coming in towards his chest and Barresi left it alone

NETHERLANDS:6.2  Bresnan to Kervezee, out Caught by Prior!! Good bowling by Bresnan does the trick for England, who needed that badly. Saw Kervezee backing away to leg and followed him with a sharp short of length delivery, it cramped him for room and Kervezee ended up by gloving his pull to Prior Kervezee c Prior b Bresnan 16(25) [4s-2] Bresnan to Kervezee, THATS OUT!!

NETHERLANDS:5.4  Broad to Barresi, no run, back of a length on off stump, Barresi defends compactly off the backfoot
NETHERLANDS:5.3  Broad to Barresi, FOUR!!, that is a much better shot, back of a length outside off, Barresi just played the upper dab/cut over backward point, used Broad's pace and then guided it over the infield, Broad is complaining to Strauss about something, he does that all the time
NETHERLANDS:5.2  Broad to Barresi, FOUR!!, Can't call that a dropped chance, will be very cruel to Prior if we did that, it flew off the edge as Barresi went hard at that, both Prior and Strauss at slip were confused as to who should go for the catch, Prior by instinct threw his right hand at it, but it had gone over his hand in a flash, Broad is not impressed though
NETHERLANDS:5.1  Broad to Kervezee, 1 run, fullish outside off, Kervezee backs away to leg, throws his bat at it, it runs off the thick outside edge to third man

NETHERLANDS:4.2  Bresnan to Kervezee, no run, an over ambitious appeal from Bresnan and England as the ball struck Kervezee on the pads, but it was sliding well down the leg side, maybe an inside edge onto the pads, not sure though, England rightly do not take the referral

NETHERLANDS:3.3  Broad to Kervezee, no run, another bumper, much shorter and well directed too, Kervezee again lets it go by ducking under it, good bowling by Broad who has realised that it is better to bang it in hard rather than pitch it up on this batting beauty

NETHERLANDS:2.4  Anderson to Kervezee, FOUR!!, and as soon as Strauss does that, Kervezee goes over mid on, one bounce over the ropes, it looked to the naked eye that he did not time that, but it had the timing and the power to get to the fenceNow both the slips are out as Strauss sees the futility of putting them in. Now a short cover is placed and the fine leg has come a lot finer.

NETHERLANDS:1.5  Broad to Kervezee, FOUR!!, that is a good shot, Broad errs in line, only slightly though, but Kervezee is good enough to whip that away stylishly to fine leg, the fielder was too wide and he had no chance

Getting runs on the board will be the key. I was there in Australia, 6-1 was bad, the players were not ready to play and they were in poor form. KP has been picked out of the lot to open the innnings, I don't have any problems with that. But, it is a high risk situation.Collingwood: ODI cricket is not rocket science, we want to put the opposition under pressure. We didn't do well tactically in the ODI series against Australia. A nice outing against Pakistan in the warm up game was good for me, hopefully I will come back to form. It is good to have Swann back. He is one of the best spinners in the world at this moment.Netherlands have won the toss and elected to batStrauss: The wicket is not going to change, we would want to start well with the new ball. Swann comes back in, we are very excited to get some momentum going our way early on. Very excited about the change of role for KP. Yardy is not playing, Swann is in.Peter Borren: We would like to bat first, we have had a very good preparation coming into this WC. Guys are raring to go and we would like to make the most of it. The wicket looks really good for batting. We want to put runs on board and hopefully put England under some pressure. We have some experienced guys as well.Team news coming up, England won't play Yardy today. England are going batting heavy, Bopara will play at No. 6 and Prior will follow.Pitch report: The wicket looks magnificent, it will be a high scoring game. The grass is nicely rolled, the ball will come onto the bat, and it is a win the toss bat first pitch feels Ian Botham.Hello folks, welcome to the live coverage of the Group B league game featuring England and Netherlands from Nagpur. Will England's move of getting Kevin Pietersen to bat at the top of the order work out for them? Will Ryan ten Doeschate, the man with a batting average of over 68, spring some surprises? Don't go away, this is Ajith bring you all the action along with Ganesh, Pradeep and Srivathsa. We will be back with more updates.by Karthik LakshmananIt's a time when the minnows are made to feel left out in world cricket by the governing body. The ICC, by deciding to restrict the number of teams to 10 in the future World Cups, has openly stated that the associate members are not good enough to compete at the international level. In the light of this, the minnows have more incentive than ever to prove the ICC wrong. And however one sided the matches may have been so far, it's a sure bet that England won't take the minnows lightly ahead of their clash with Netherlands, even if the ICC does.Team NewsEngland: England's preparations to the World Cup have been woeful. Post Ashes, everyone expected them to thrash the Aussies in the CB series, but before they realised what hit them, they found themselves down and out. The tour to Australia, which started emphatically with a historic Ashes win, ended on a bitter note as the visitors were thumped 6-1 by the home team. If the pre- World Cup season was bad, their start in the warm up matches was no better. Up against a lowly rated Canada team, England just about managed to eke out a narrow 16 run win in their first warm up game. The batting order barring Trott and Prior failed against the slow bowlers and managed just 243. The reply with the ball started in predictable manner as the bowlers had Canada tottering at 28-5 at one stage. But a spirited knock from Cheema and some ordinary bowling in the middle overs nearly cost England the match.
England would take confidence from their all round performance against Pakistan in their next warm up game. Kevin Pietersen's success at the opening position, Collingwood's return to form and some useful contributions from the middle order saw them put up a stiff target. The bowlers backed the batsmen and the Poms completed a comprehensive win.
Injuries to key players, inconsistent performances and an eternal feeling of home sickness has plagued the team's build up to the World Cup. But Graeme Swann's return after injury, Stuard Broad's 10 wickets in 2 warm up games, and a promising opener in Kevin Pietersen augurs well for England ahead of their World Cup campaign.Netherlands: Netherlands don't have much to boast about their performances in the ODI arena. They lost three consecutive warm up games - two in Dubai against Canada and Zimbabwe and one in Sri Lanka against the Lankans. But their thrilling last over win against Kenya in their last warm up game, powered by ten Doeschate's spirited performance which yielded 98 runs, should raise their spirits ahead of their World Cup campaign. The other minnows in the World Cup are yet to prove the ICC wrong, and Netherlands would be keen to do that.Head to Head:England and Netherlands have met twice, once in the 1996 World Cup and once in the 2003 edition. England comprehensively defeated the Dutch in both the meetings. However, the last time the two teams met on an international stage was in the World T20 in 2009, when England slumped to a shock defeat. That match will be uppermost on both sides' minds.Quotes: "We have contrasting styles and that will make it hard for the bowlers to adjust to us. I'm very excited batting along side Kevin and I think he can flourish." - England captain Andrew Strauss on Kevin Pietersen's promotion in the batting order.
"We won one match each at the last two World Cups and we definitely want to improve that record," - Netherlands batsman Tom Cooper.
