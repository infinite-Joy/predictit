PAKISTAN:44.6 Rubel to Ajmal, out Junaid Khan Run Out!! Great piece of fielding as Junaid departs because of his laziness. The third umpire gives the verdict in favour of Bangladesh. Coming back to the ball, it was a yorker outside off, Ajmal squeezes it out towards point and sets off, Junaid was out of his crease too. Ajmal decides not to take the single and Junaid stops, turns and runs back as Sabbir was charging in from point, he picks the ball and fires in a direct-hit at the non-striker's end. The third umpire took his time and decided that it is out as Junaid didn't drag his bat in. He tried planting his bat inside the crease, but the stumps were disturbed just moments before he grounded his bat. Junaid Khan run out (S Rahman) 0(0)Rubel to Ajmal, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!The third umpire has been pressed into service for a run-out decision. Junaid probably put his bat inside the crease just in time to save himself there. Wait a minute! It looks closer than it appeared to be in the first replay. It's a very close one. The umpire is checking it frame by frame, he wants to be sure about this decision. Here comes the decision and Junaid has been given out. He walks back disappointed

PAKISTAN:44.2 Rubel to Rizwan, no ball, what was that? A beamer from Rubel that almost took Rizwan on its way, the batsman did well to get out of the way. The umpire gives an official warning for that as well. Rubel apologises to the batsman as it must have slipped out of his hand

He decides to review it. Rubel's front foot foot is fine and the batsman didn't get any bat on that. Is the ball going down leg or is it hitting leg stump? Even if it's clipping, the onfield decision will stay. The Hawk-Eye is taking a lot of time for some reason. The Bangladeshi players wait and the decision is out.

The batsmen should be watchful, runs will come as the innings progresses, the team winning the toss might opt to bowl first,' reckons Athar Ali KhanTeams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan(c), Nasir Hossain, Sabbir Rahman, Abul Hasan, Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Taskin AhmedPakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Azhar Ali(c), Haris Sohail, Saad Nasim, Fawad Alam, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Mohammad Rizwan, Wahab Riaz, Junaid Khan, Saeed Ajmal, Rahat AliBangladesh have won the toss and have opted to batBoth teams have had their share of administrative wrangings and the series will provide them a much needed distraction from events which are out of their control. There's some early team news from the Pakistan camp. Mohammad Rizwan, the wicket-keeper batsman and Saad Nasim, the all-rounder, are set to make their ODI debuts for Pakistan.On the other hand, hosts, Bangladesh are a confident unit. They put up their best ever performance in the World Cup scalping England before eventually losing to India in the quarter-final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Mashrafe Mortaza led an inspired show from the Tigers, but he will be missing today, serving his one-match ban for slow over-rate during the Q/F match against India.13:45 Local Time, 07:45 GMT, 13:15 IST: It's the beginning of a new era in Pakistan cricket. Misbah-ul-Haq and Shahid Afridi announced their ODI retirements at the end of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Saeed Ajmal, who missed the sport's biggest tournament after his action was found to be illegal, returns after having rectified his bowling action. Azhar Ali, who wasn't considered good enough to be a part of the 15-member WC squad has been named as the captain. Wicket-keeper batsman, Sarfraz Ahmed, will be his deputy. Also returning to the team is Mohammad Hafeez, who missed the World Cup with an injury.Preview:If one looks at Bangladesh's record against Pakistan, it is abysmal. In 47 international matches spread across formats, Bangladesh have registered just one victory and it came in an ODI 16 years ago during the 1999 World Cup match in Northampton. They have lost 25 consecutive ODIs against them since that day. In the list of bogey teams, Pakistan's name is right on top for Bangladesh. However, in a fresh season, it is time for a new beginning.It is a new era for Pakistan. With Misbah-ul-Haq retiring from ODIs after the end of the World Cup, the team will be led by Azhar Ali, who last played an ODI two years ago. During his time, Azhar has demonstrated a cool head and the tourists will be hoping for some stability in his leadership.Already, players from both camps are having their say. Shakib Al Hasan said this series was the best opportunity for Bangladesh to register a win over Pakistan. In the opposition camp, allrounder Mohammad Hafeez pointed out that Pakistan have the resources but cautiously stated that Bangladesh are an improved team. On paper, Pakistan are favorites to continue the dominance but Bangladesh will be determined to snap this losing streak. The home team have already made the right start after a BCB XI defeated a full strength Pakistan team by one wicket during a warm-up match in Fatullah on Wednesday.Venue: Shere Bangla Stadium, MirpurDate: April 17, 2015Time: 14:30 localTeam news:BangladeshShakib Al Hasan, who was playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 8, will come back to lead the team in the first ODI after Mashrafe Moratza was ruled out due to a knee injury. The team will also see Rony Talukdar making his ODI debut. Talukdar was the most consistent performer in the Bangladesh domestic circuit last year when he scored 714 runs in the Dhaka Premier Division while he also made 777 runs in the National Cricket League games. He will partner Tamim Iqbal as Bangladesh search for stability at the top. The batting will once again revolve around the trio of Shakib, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah, who became the first Bangladesh player to score consecutive centuries in the World Cup.Probable XI1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Rony Talukdar, 3 Soumya Sarkar, 4 Mahmudullah, 5 Shakib Al Hasan (c), 6 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7 Sabbir Rahman, 8 Nasir Hossain, 9 Rubel Hossain, 10 Abul Hasan, 11 Taskin AhmedPakistanThe scoreline for Pakistan already reads 3-0. They have lost three players heading into the series. Sohaib Maqsood was ruled out due to a fractured wrist while Sohail Khan, who impressed in the 2015 World Cup, will miss the series due to a back injury. During the warm-up game in Fatullah, Yasir Shah sustained a hand injury which required stitches, thus ruling him out for the ODI series.However, in addition to a new captain, Pakistan will also welcome back Junaid Khan, who missed the World Cup due to a knee injury and Saeed Ajmal, who will play his first international match after remodelling his action. The team will also see some fresh faces in 22-year-old Mohammad Rizwan, the back-up keeper to Sarfraz Ahmed and also 19-year-old Sami Aslam, who captained the Pakistan U-19 team in the 2014 World Cup. The presence of Junaid and Ajmal will be reassuring for a team that has struggled in bilateral series. In the last 13 ODIs, they have won just three games. Pakistan will aim to improve their record in bilateral ODIs in a new season.Probable XI1 Mohammad Hafeez, 2 Sami Aslam, 3 Haris Sohail, 4 Azhar Ali (c), 5 Sarfraz Ahmed (wk), 6 Asad Shafiq, 7 Saad Nasim, 8 Wahab Riaz, 9 Saeed Ajmal, 10 Junaid Khan, 11 Rahat Ali/Ehsan AdilQuotes"We break down mentally when we lose a practice match abroad. Pakistan might be having the same thought process, which will have some effect on the first game. We will try to play better cricket." - Bangladesh legspinner Sabbir Rahman fires a psychological salvo at Pakistan following a win by the BCB XI over them in Fatullah on Wednesday."It might look easy to beat them but they never been as easy. For the last 2-3 years, they have developed into a good team." - Pakistan allrounder Mohammad Hafeez has urged his team not to take Bangladesh lightly.Teams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Azhar Ali(c), Haris Sohail, Saad Nasim, Fawad Alam, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Asad Shafiq, Wahab Riaz, Junaid Khan, Saeed Ajmal, Rahat Ali, Sami Aslam, Mohammad Rizwan, Ehsan AdilBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Rony Talukdar, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan(c), Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Abul Hasan, Mominul HaqueLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
