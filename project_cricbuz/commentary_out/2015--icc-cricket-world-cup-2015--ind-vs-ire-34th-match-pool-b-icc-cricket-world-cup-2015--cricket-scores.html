INDIA:36.5 36.5K O'Brien to Kohli, FOUR, India have recorded their fifth consecutive win in this World Cup. Kohli dispatches this with utter disdain. Full and outside off, he walked down the crease and hammered it past the cover fielder, long-off had no chance of cutting that off
INDIA:36.4 K O'Brien to Kohli, no run, again, full and outside off, Kohli jams it on the wicket, the ball bounces over the stumps, lucky that it didn't go back onto the stumps
INDIA:36.3 K O'Brien to Kohli, no run, too full and outside off, Kohli takes a step out of the crease, reaches out and squeezes it to backward point
INDIA:36.2 K O'Brien to Rahane, 1 run, full and outside off, Rahane leans into the drive and creams it to sweeper cover
INDIA:36.1 K O'Brien to Kohli, 1 run, Kevin O'Brien has hurt his hand. Bowls a juicy half-volley, Kohli drills it to the left of the bowler, O'Brien sticks his hand and tries to deflect it onto the stumps as Rahane was backing up, the ball was well wide of the stumps and the batsmen scamper across for a runKevin O'Brien [6.0-0-36-0] is back into the attackIndia are one hit away from sealing the game.
INDIA:35.6 Cusack to Kohli, 1 run, keeps the strike with a steer to short third man
INDIA:35.5 Cusack to Kohli, FOUR, cracking shot! Short and outside off, Kohli stands tall and cracks the cut to deep backward point, not a muscle moved in the field as the ball whistled across to the fence
INDIA:35.4 Cusack to Rahane, 1 run, shortish and outside off, Rahane dabs it to backward point, Kohli once more calls for a quick single, he gets there even as the fielder fires a throw at his end, mid-wicket doesn't back up in time, but there was the fielder in the deep
INDIA:35.3 Cusack to Rahane, no run, good length ball on off, Rahane gets behind the line and defends down the wicket
INDIA:35.2 Cusack to Rahane, FOUR, lovely shot! Rahane allowed the ball to arrive, opened the face of the bat and used the pace of the bowler, third man was inside the circle and he had no chance of cutting that off
INDIA:35.1 Cusack to Kohli, 1 run, short of length on off, Kohli shuffles across a touch and tucks it to deep square leg
INDIA:35.1 Cusack to Kohli, wide, splays it well down leg, Kohli stays inside the line and lets it go, wide called
INDIA:34.6 J Mooney to Rahane, FOUR, edged and four! The third man fielder was square and the ball went very fine. It was full and on the fourth stump line, Rahane was looking for the flick, closed the bat face early and the leading edge runs away fine
INDIA:34.5 J Mooney to Rahane, no run, slower and close to off, Rahane gets forward and turns it gently to short mid-wicket
INDIA:34.4 J Mooney to Kohli, 1 run, another good looking cover drive, comes well forward, presents the straight bat and drives it towards cover, the fielder dives to his right and parries it to long-off
INDIA:34.3 J Mooney to Rahane, 1 run, on a length just outside off, Rahane looks to drive and gets an inside edge onto the pad, the ball rolls away in front of point, Rahane looks at Kohli, who responds and sprints through for a quick single
INDIA:34.2 J Mooney to Rahane, no run, tails back in from a length, Rahane stays rooted to the crease and is rapped on the pads, he missed the nudge through the on-side. Luckily for him, the impact was around off and the ball struck him a bit high on the padLoud shout for LBW and Porterfield signals for the review. Dharmasena was not interested. No issues with the no-ball, Mooney is fine with the front foot. Is height a factor? There is no wood on that. It hit him above the knee roll. Hawk-Eye shows impact as umpires call and it is also just clipping the top of the stumps. The onfield decision remains.
INDIA:34.1 J Mooney to Rahane, no run, good length ball, bit of shape away outside off, left aloneWilson continues to stand up to the stumps for Mooney..
INDIA:33.6 Cusack to Kohli, no run, tad short and outside off, Kohli mistimes the punch to cover, he is disappointed. The bottom hand coming into play there as went too hard at it
INDIA:33.5 Cusack to Rahane, 1 run, pitched up on off, Rahane drives it straight down the ground, long-on runs to his left and keeps it to a singleJadeja is padded up and not Raina. The way these two are going, doesn't look like he will get a hit.
INDIA:33.4 Cusack to Kohli, 1 run, back of a length around off, Kohli punches it wide of cover, for a single
INDIA:33.3 Cusack to Kohli, FOUR, bad delivery and Kohli says thank you very much. Short and well wide of off, Kohli had all the time to pick his spot, he cuts it between backward point and short third man
INDIA:33.2 Cusack to Rahane, 1 run, full and slanting in, Rahane leans forward and wrists it to long-on
INDIA:33.1 Cusack to Kohli, 1 run, short of length on off, Kohli eases it off the back foot to the right of the bowler, Cusack can't get there and the duo go through with the runAlex Cusack [6.0-0-23-0] is back into the attackDrinks are on the field now. India are cruising comfortably, they might as well take the batting powerplay and finish it off. Well, looks like they read my mind, the umpire signals for the powerplay..One has to give it to Porterfield for still keeping a slip for the very expensive Thompson. What else can Porterfield do? The Indians are batting so well, that even 400 looks chasable on this wicket. Maybe he wants to show that he still trusts his young bowler against some of the best batsmen in the world. But Thompson hasn't helped his skipper by bowling too full and giving the batsmen the room to drive and loft.
INDIA:32.6 J Mooney to Rahane, no run, punched off the back foot to cover
INDIA:32.5 J Mooney to Rahane, FOUR, it keeps getting better and better and better. This one is on a bent knee, width offered by Mooney and Rahane got forward to cream the drive, cover dived in vain again and this time sweeper didn't even bother to chase it down
INDIA:32.4 J Mooney to Rahane, no run, full and on the pads, flicked straight to the fielder at mid-wicket
INDIA:32.3 J Mooney to Rahane, no run, length ball, turned towards square leg, Rahane says no to Kohli for the quick single
INDIA:32.3 J Mooney to Rahane, wide, was that a ploy to get Rahane out stumped on the leg-side? But Rahane never moved, down leg, Rahane flicks and misses. Wilson whips the bails off, good glovework standing up
INDIA:32.2 J Mooney to Rahane, FOUR, now Rahane gets into the act. He gets forward and slightly reaches out, but times the drive so well, that he beats cover to his left and the sweeper to his right. Came right off the middle of the bat. So easy on the eye too
INDIA:32.1 J Mooney to Rahane, no run, pushed to cover off the front foot
INDIA:32.1 J Mooney to Rahane, wide, shortish and well outside off, Rahane reaches out to cut and misses. Wide calledJohn Mooney [4.0-0-28-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:31.6 S Thompson to Rahane, 1 run, pushes this to long-on, and retains the strike with that run
INDIA:31.5 S Thompson to Rahane, FOUR, that is a fine, fine late cut by Rahane. Rahane opens the face of the bat and delays the cut, then plays it very late and sends it wide of third man, running and diving across to cut it off, it was all in vain eventually
INDIA:31.4 S Thompson to Kohli, 1 run, back of a length and outside off, straightens too, Kohli pushes at it, gets it wide of the diving point

INDIA:30.6 K O'Brien to Rahane, no run, length ball, nudged towards square leg, no chance of a quick single as the fielder gets in quickly
INDIA:30.5 K O'Brien to Rahane, FOUR, when the Indians are playing so well, half-volleys are like a red rag to a bull, that's what O'Brien does and he is punished. Rahane just timed that past Kohli and mid-on had no chance
INDIA:30.4 K O'Brien to Kohli, 1 run, pitched up outside off, driven off the front foot to sweeper cover
INDIA:30.3 K O'Brien to Kohli, 2 runs, so nearly four to just an open-faced dab, Thompson at third man initially felt that it was an easy couple and then realised he had to sprint, which he did and then put in the full length dive, saved two runs. Good effort. But again pristine timing from Kohli
INDIA:30.2 K O'Brien to Kohli, no run, Kohli gets forward and then has to defend the length ball back to the bowler, O'Brien flicks the ball back to the keeper
INDIA:30.1 K O'Brien to Kohli, no run, shortish outside off, cut straight to the fielder at point. Hit hard, but not in the gap

INDIA:29.4 S Thompson to Rahane, no run, pitched up outside off, Rahane gets forward and drives, very well, but straight to the fielder at cover
INDIA:29.3 S Thompson to Kohli, 1 run, now a picture perfect off-drive as he walks forward and meets the ball on the rise, down to long-off
INDIA:29.2 S Thompson to Kohli, 2 runs, back of a length outside off, rising too, Kohli controls the cut and gets it to the left of the diving point fielder, they take two
INDIA:29.1 S Thompson to Kohli, FOUR, arrogance. Sheer arrogance from Kohli. Another step forward out, then almost takes it on the half-volley, drilled to the right of Rahane and gave mid-on no chance. How well-timed was that? The bowler too is impressed by that, puffs his cheeks out and just walks back to his mark
INDIA:28.6 K O'Brien to Kohli, 1 run, on a good length and Kohli gets forward to play a sweet off-drive, to long-off

INDIA:28.2 K O'Brien to Rahane, 1 run, full and on middle, wristed wide of mid-on
INDIA:28.1 K O'Brien to Kohli, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Kohli pushes away from the body and gets a sort of an outside edge, but safely to third man
INDIA:27.6 S Thompson to Rahane, no run, on a good length and outside off, left alone
INDIA:27.5 S Thompson to Kohli, 1 run, length outside off, punched off the front foot, beats the diving cover who parries it to long-offAjinkya Rahane, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:27.4 S Thompson to Dhawan, out Caught by Porterfield!! Excellent catch and Kohli pats Dhawan on the head as he walks past him. Dhawan wanted to finish the game off as soon as possible, went for the leg-side hoick, was early into the shot, the leading edge seemed to be landing in no-man's land, but Porterfield ran back from cover and held on with both hands over his shoulder. Never an easy catch that, but Porterfield made it look easy. Tumbled down and then got up to be surrounded by his mates. Dhawan walks off to a standing ovation from the Seddon Park faithful - 11,000 odd and something. Dhawan c Porterfield b S Thompson 100(85) [4s-11 6s-5]S Thompson to Dhawan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:27.3 S Thompson to Kohli, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Kohli drives to sweeper cover, just a single
INDIA:27.2 S Thompson to Kohli, SIX, Kohli has had enough of Thompson. A step or two out and then thunders the length ball over long-on. What power in that hit, only bottom-hand doing the trick, a flat hit as the spectators had to duck for cover. Kohli certainly made a statement there
INDIA:27.1 S Thompson to Kohli, no run, Kohli gets forward and plays a strong bottom-handed cover drive, but straight to the fielder at cover
INDIA:26.6 K O'Brien to Kohli, 1 run, worked to deep backward square leg, Kohli retains the strike with that runDhawan got there with a clip through square leg, shuffles across and takes it on the full, exposed his stumps but managed to put it away. Raises the bat and takes the helmet off. His trademark celebration with both arms stretched out wide. Brilliant innings once again from him
INDIA:26.5 K O'Brien to Dhawan, 1 run, there it is! 100 for Dhawan. His second hundred in this World Cup and how his fortunes have turned! Eighth overall in ODIs. Was this the same Dhawan who struggled so miserably against Australia all summer? Back then, he couldn't buy a run. Was even dropped for the last Test at Sydney. People were behind his back, some even questioning his place in the World Cup 15. Some wanted Murali Vijay to take his place in the final 15. What a way to respond to your critics. There is something about ICC tournaments and Dhawan! It certainly spurs him on
INDIA:26.4 K O'Brien to Dhawan, no run, Dhawan is looking a tad nervy, in the last 5-10 minutes. This one is on the stumps, Dhawan drops it near his feet and looks for the impossible run, no chance as Kohli rightly sends him back
INDIA:26.3 K O'Brien to Dhawan, no run, slower delivery from O'Brien, Dhawan gets forward and wrists it, but short mid-wicket dives to his right and keeps Dhawan on 99Now he is on 99. The crowd know that and they are making quite a noise as they egg Dhawan on

INDIA:25.3 S Thompson to Kohli, wide, Kohli charges Thompson, the bowler bowls it full and outside the guideline, wide called. The bowler doesn't like the call

INDIA:23.2 S Thompson to Rohit, out Bowled!! End of Rohit and some joy for the beleaguered Irish. Hint of nip back in for Thompson, Rohit was trying to run it down to third man, played with an angled bat and the inside edge clattered into leg stump. Rohit has missed out on an easy World Cup 100 against a very average Irish attack, on a belter. Rohit b S Thompson 64(66) [4s-3 6s-3]S Thompson to Rohit, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:23.1 S Thompson to Rohit, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, Rohit gets forward and drives to deep extra cover, placed well in the gap and it's a couple of runsStuart Thompson [1.0-0-18-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:22.6 K O'Brien to Dhawan, FOUR, one more boundary and Dhawan is tearing this Irish attack to pieces. Full and on the stumps, clipped uppishly over the diving mid-wicket fielder, beats deep mid-wicket and long-on, trying to get to the ball. Just a hit away from notching up his second hundred of the World Cup
INDIA:22.5 K O'Brien to Dhawan, no run, Dhawan is playing with a smile on his face now, shuffles across and looks for the paddle once more, but O'Brien bowled this outside off, it was a full toss and since Dhawan had moved so much, he changed his stroke and guided it straight to the fielder at point, O'Brien stares at the smiling Dhawan

INDIA:22.1 K O'Brien to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan is toying with the pedestrian Irish attack. This one is a pre-meditated stroke once again, kneels down and paddles a low full toss to the fine leg fence, O'Brien could do nothing there
INDIA:21.6 Dockrell to Dhawan, 1 run, rocks back and cuts fiercely from the stumps, to sweeper cover, retains the strike with that run
INDIA:21.5 Dockrell to Dhawan, SIX, Dhawan is making this look ridiculously easy now. This is a one-handed six. One-handed! Down the track and the bottom hand came off as he lofted it way over long-on, the ball kept going and going for yet an another six for the Delhi man
INDIA:21.4 Dockrell to Dhawan, 2 runs, Dhawan makes room and then goes inside out on a bent knee, he lost balance as he played the shot, still it almost went for a boundary, the sweeper cover runs to his left and prevents the boundary
INDIA:21.3 Dockrell to Rohit, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Rohit gets forward and drives to long-off
INDIA:21.2 Dockrell to Rohit, no run, nudged to short fine, Rohit wasn't even looking at Dhawan, Rohit was looking at the ball, Dhawan wants the strike and runs a few paces forward, but then retreats, before the throw comes in to his end. Rohit tells Dhawan to wait

INDIA:20.2 K O'Brien to Dhawan, no run, slower delivery on the stumps, pushed to cover
INDIA:20.1 K O'Brien to Dhawan, SIX, that's Gordon Greenidge, left-handed style says Deano on air and he is dead right. Look at the bravado of Dhawan, he is signalling six to the umpire. That is the confidence of the man, who couldn't buy a run when he stepped foot on Australian soil four months back. He moves across off even as K O'Brien was running in, then nonchalantly lifts one leg up in the air and then pulls it flat over backward square leg, the ball hits the glowing ad board on the bounce, but it definitely went over the ad-cushions. Third umpire confirms the sameKevin O'Brien, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackThis is India's third highest opening stand in World Cups, tells my colleague, Sidhant Maheshwari

INDIA:19.3 Dockrell to Dhawan, SIX, Dhawan is now having fun! Skips out and then swings across the line, more of a Sourav Ganguly-esque shot that, against the left-arm spinner, the ball went a long way back into the grass banks at deep mid-wicket
INDIA:19.2 Dockrell to Rohit, 1 run, floated up outside off, Rohit is lured forward, isn't to the pitch as the ball drops, but still manages to steer it in front of point

INDIA:17.3 Cusack to Dhawan, 1 run, back of a length outside off, softly punched to sweeper cover
INDIA:17.2 Cusack to Dhawan, no run, shortish outside off, cut straight to the fielder at cover
INDIA:17.1 Cusack to Dhawan, no run, what happened there? Dhawan shuffled across way outside off and then scooped it straight into the keeper's helmet. That must have stung and Dhawan shows good sportsmanship by patting Wilson. The ball drops on the off-side, wouldn't have mattered even if it had been caught as it would've been called a dead ball. The laws state that once it's caught after it hits a fielder's helmet, it can't be given outHowever, once he got set, Dhawan thumped Cusack for a couple of boundaries. It could be said that early on in the innings, Dhawan struggled for touch due to the lack of pace from Ireland's slew of medium pacers. Dhawan certainly thrives on pace on the ball. He also took a heavy toll of some ordinary bowling by Stuart Thompson to thump him for a four and a six. Thompson looked rusty as this is his first game in this World Cup. Dhawan then cracked a well-deserved fifty. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: Rohit Sharma presented the full face of the bat to play some glorious drives. In particular, the on-drive he essayed off Alex Cusack's bowling was a sumptuous stroke. He also lofted John Mooney over mid-off for a six. On the other hand, Shikhar Dhawan had his fair share of luck. Mooney dropped a caught and bowled chance and William Porterfield dropped a tough chance too.Drinks are on the field now. I'm more than happy that drinks came at the right moment. It was getting unbearable to listen to the commentary on air, with all the stuff about food, table cloth and blah blah being spoken ad nauseam
INDIA:16.6 Stirling to Dhawan, 1 run, eased to long-off, single taken
INDIA:16.5 Stirling to Dhawan, FOUR, now finesse! Pre-meditates the paddle, kneels down low and gets it fine, fine leg had no chance

INDIA:16.2 Stirling to Dhawan, 1 run, fifty for Dhawan. He continues his good run. 13th fifty for him in ODIs. He gets there with a flick to deep mid-wicket. A raise of the bat and a smile from Jinks is all we get to see

There are two slips in place.Rohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. J Mooney will open the attackJamie Alter brings this update from the ground. "Some grey clouds hanging over one end of the ground. Could be a factor later on, especially if Ireland's seamers get busy."Ashwin: "I thought they batted pretty well when they started. We had to pull it back, but we were confident that if we get a couple of quick wickets, things would change and that's what happened. It's a very good pitch. We've restricted them to a score that we would like to chase. Knowing MS (Dhoni), I don't think so (asked if it was pre-planned by Dhoni to bowl a lot spinners). It's an instinctive decision from him. They were struggling to push the ball for singles and that's why he got in more spinners. It was more about varying the pace for me on this surface. It is a conscious effort from me to bowl a lot slower, I have decided to bowl that way. I knew the wickets will come because of the five fielders inside the ring as batsmen will look to go over the top. All these ICC tournaments are about momentum and hopefully we will bat well and chase this down easily."For a brief period, Niall O'Brien and Andrew Balbirnie raised genuine hopes of taking Ireland to a sizeable total, but losing the wickets of Balbirnie, Kevin O'Brien and Niall O' Brien at a crucial juncture of the innings didn't help their cause. For India, Ashwin continued his rich vein of form by bowling with control and took two wickets. Raina too did a commendable job in the middle overs. The Indian unit would be confident of chasing down this target. On the other hand, Ireland have an uphill task on their hands.Umesh Yadav and Shami erred by bowling short on a flat deck and the batsmen duly took advantage of it. Both Stirling and Porterfield used the pull shot to good effect. They also played some stirring back foot punches. However, once the spinners were introduced into the attack, Ireland lost their way. Stirling was out to a soft dismissal and their key batsman, Ed Joyce, played a poor shot to lose his wicket to Raina. Mohit Sharma then sent Porterfield back to the pavilion after he constructed a fine fifty.However, the bowlers made a superb comeback in the end overs by picking up a slew of wickets. In particular, Mohammed Shami snaring the wicket of Kevin O'Brien gave India the upper hand. Earlier, Stirling and William Porterfield gave a glimpse of their ability to play cracking shots on the back foot to put the Indian seamers under pressure.Despite Niall O'Brien's enterprising knock, the Indian bowlers took wickets at regular intervals to bowl out the opposition for a below par total. This is the first time, India have cleaned up the opposition for five successive times in ODIs. In fact, after Ravichandran Ashwin, with subtle variations of drift, did a tremendous job to keep the batsmen in check and snaffle the key wicket of Paul Stirling, Niall O'Brien, played with fearlessness to take on the spinners. When MS Dhoni introduced the part-timer, Rohit Sharma, Niall O'Brien decided to up the tempo and scored a couple of boundaries. He then used the paddle sweep to place the ball into gaps and collected boundaries off Suresh Raina. He also clouted Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja for sixes.Thanks to Sanjay Manjrekar for this stat. This is the first time that India have bowled out their opponents in 5 consecutive ODIs.4

This is what he told Ambati Rayudu, the substitute fielder, who was fielding at cover when Suresh Raina was bowling to William Porterfield. He says in Hindi: 'Paer dekh zara, uska paer dekh kaise hil raha hain, uske hisaab se anticipate kar, volleyball ki tarah khada hua hain beach pe'The English translation of the above lines is - Look at how he is moving his feet, you have to anticipate where the ball will go, you are just standing there like you are playing a volleyball game on the beach.The batting powerplay yielded 41/2 for Ireland

He isn't just in fine form in this tournament, but ever since he was praised by Shane Warne for his ability to tackle his box of tricks on a rather difficult track and score 70 against Hampshire at the Rose Bowl in Southampton in May 2005, he has been known as one of the better players of spin in the Ireland set-up. But the credit has to go to Ireland, as they have recovered well.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 21.4 overs: The Indian spinners tightened the screws on the Irish batsmen and were able to keep the opposition in check. The track is offering a bit of grip and Ireland have been tentative against the spinners. Ravichandran Ashwin has been in superb form in this World Cup and he yet again flummoxed the batsmen with his flight and guile and bowled parsimoniously. Suresh Raina also made his presence felt by taking the key wicket of Ed Joyce. With the batsmen struggling against spin, MS Dhoni also introduced Rohit Sharma into the attack. It was Niall O'Brien, who decided to take on the part-timer, Rohit, and essayed a couple of boundaries. He also thwacked Ashwin for a six down the ground. However, Dhoni missed a stumping chance off Raina's bowling to give William Porterfield a reprieve. But he didn't survive for long as Porterfield was dismissed by Mohit Sharma. O'Brien though, has looked in very good touch.Drinks are on the field now . Can we make this a 60-over contest? India have bowled 39 overs in just 2 hours and 20 minutes.
IRELAND:38.6 Ashwin to Balbirnie, out Caught by Shami!! Flighted ball from Ashwin, Balbirnie goes for the sweep but gets a top edge, short fine leg runs to his left and just about manages to hold onto the ball.

IRELAND:38.5 Ashwin to N O'Brien, leg byes, 1 run, oh no! India don't have the review. Ash fires this full, O'Brien was actually looking to sweep, but didn't offer a shot, he was hit just outside off stump, but because he didn't offer a shot, it should have been given out as it was certainly going on to hit the stumps, Dharmasena was the umpire and he inexplicably shook his head and walked away, India were stunned. But maybe the umpire forgot that the batsman didn't offer a shot there, India didn't have the review to challenge the call

IRELAND:17.3 Raina to N O'Brien, no run, on a yorker length and on the stumps, O'Brien keeps it outNiall O'Brien, left handed bat, comes to the creasePorterfield's opening partner, Paul Stirling, is another batsman, who is good at playing the pull and the cut. Mohammed Shami tried a short ball and Stirling too used the pull to thump him for a six. He and Porterfield also essayed fine back foot punches. It was surprising to see the Indian pacers banging it short to batsmen, who are fine back foot players and on a deck that is flat. In short, after playing at the WACA, the Indian seamers struggled to make the adjustment with the new ball. MS Dhoni then introduced the spinners into the attack, and Ravichandran Ashwin was able to stem the run flow to some extent and was rewarded with the wicket of Stirling. Stirling won't be happy with that soft dismissal. Suresh Raina then cleaned up Ed Joyce by pushing it through and Joyce paid the price for looking to play the cut shot.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17.2 overs: Ireland started their innings on a very good note. It was William Porterfield, who slashed at a short and wide delivery from Umesh Yadav to collect Ireland's first boundary. He then used the pull shot to clout Umesh for a six on the back foot. Porterfield, who plays for Warwickshire, is known for his ability to play well on the back foot in the County circuit. With that wicket, the players have taken drinks
IRELAND:17.2 Raina to Ed Joyce, out Bowled!! Cleaned up by Raina. He roars in delight. Fired in and skidded on flatter, Ed Joyce was on the back foot and making room to cut, it was an ill-advised shot, and the ball clatters into middle. The stump is uprooted. After a good start, Ireland have lost two quick wickets. Ed Joyce b Raina 2(9)Raina to Ed Joyce, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
IRELAND:17.1 Raina to Ed Joyce, no run, full on the stumps, pushed to cover
IRELAND:16.6 Ashwin to Ed Joyce, 1 run, fraction short and on the stumps, Ed Joyce gets back and punches it to long-on
IRELAND:16.5 Ashwin to Ed Joyce, no run, dances down and since the length is on a yorker length, he squeezes it out
IRELAND:16.4 Ashwin to Ed Joyce, no run, skips out and since he isn't to the pitch of the ball, defends
IRELAND:16.3 Ashwin to Ed Joyce, no run, Ed Joyce comes down the track and then plays across the line, his flick finds mid-on
IRELAND:16.2 Ashwin to Ed Joyce, no run, that turned and bounced over the off stump as Ed Joyce pushed his bat inside the line, can safely say that Joyce didn't know much about that delivery. Again flight, dip and turn for Ashwin

IRELAND:15.6 Raina to Porterfield, no run, flicked straight to the fielder at mid-wicket

IRELAND:15.3 Raina to Porterfield, no run, loud shout for lbw, but India don't take the review. Kettleborough rejecting the appeal. Skidding on and Porterfield is rapped on the pads, on the back foot, would've missed leg. Replays show it was just clipping leg, umpire's call
IRELAND:15.2 Raina to Porterfield, no run, Raina cramps Porterfield for room, hit back to Raina
IRELAND:15.1 Raina to Porterfield, no run, punched to short coverSuresh Raina, right-arm off break, comes into the attackEd Joyce, left handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:14.6 Ashwin to Stirling, out Caught by Rahane!! When he hit that, I thought it was a six. But Stirling has picked out Rahane at long-off. Beautiful flight from Ashwin, it hangs in the air and then dips on Stirling, who chipped the lofted shot straight to the fielder. Maybe he should've gone for it whole-heartedly rather than playing a tame neither-here-neither-there stroke. Stirling c Rahane b Ashwin 42(41) [4s-4 6s-2]Ashwin to Stirling, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

IRELAND:7.6 Shami to Stirling, 1 run, another slash and shouts of 'catch' but well wide of point and a single to third man
IRELAND:7.5 Shami to Stirling, FOUR, Stirling picks the off-cutting slower delivery from Shami, it sat up short and Stirling slashed it up and over cover-point. Can't afford to give width on this pitch. Not sure how many times I will say that today
IRELAND:7.4 Shami to Stirling, no run, Shami digs it in short and forces Stirling to hop back and defend
IRELAND:7.3 Shami to Stirling, no run, looked like the slower delivery, outside off, Stirling drives with an open face and finds Jaddu at point
IRELAND:7.2 Shami to Porterfield, 1 run, on the pads, Porterfield tucks it to deep square legOnly a slip and a short mid-wicket now. Deep square leg back
IRELAND:7.1 Shami to Porterfield, no run, Porterfield tries to hit that too hard, completely mistimes it back to Shami
IRELAND:6.6 Mohit Sharma to Porterfield, 3 runs, good stop by Jaddu. It was short and wide outside off, Porterfield carved that over point and Jaddu running back put in the slide and pulled it back. The third ump has a look and reckons it's a safe stop
IRELAND:6.5 Mohit Sharma to Porterfield, no run, another back of the hand slower delivery from Mohit Sharma, down leg once more, Porterfield misses out, it runs off the thigh pad and Dhoni collects
IRELAND:6.4 Mohit Sharma to Porterfield, no run, pitched up outside off, width was there, Porterfield threw his bat at that and missed. There was no real appeal from the Indians, even as I heard something
IRELAND:6.4 Mohit Sharma to Porterfield, wide, back of the hand slower delivery from Mohit Sharma, but slips it down leg, wide called
IRELAND:6.3 Mohit Sharma to Porterfield, FOUR, look at the outfield. It's like a billiards table. Kept running away from the chasing Kohli. Superb back foot punch from Porterfield, timed that so well and beat Kohli at mid-off
IRELAND:6.2 Mohit Sharma to Porterfield, no run, two false strokes in a row, full and outside off, Porterfield went for the big cover drive, the inside edge rolls to mid-wicket

IRELAND:5.5 Shami to Stirling, no run, full and on the stumps, flicked to mid-onA slip has been taken out now and an extra man placed on the off-side. Four now there
IRELAND:5.4 Shami to Stirling, FOUR, stand and deliver from Stirling. On-the-up and just powered that through cover. On a good length and outside off and Stirling didn't miss out. He looks to be in the mood todayPorterfield wants a new bat
IRELAND:5.3 Shami to Porterfield, 1 run, punched off the front foot wide of mid-off, quick single taken
IRELAND:5.3 Shami to Porterfield, wide, way too short and Dhoni has to leap high to prevent any extra runs. Does so and gloves it with one hand
IRELAND:5.2 Shami to Porterfield, no run, back of a length on off, Porterfield defends it near short cover
IRELAND:5.1 Shami to Porterfield, no run, nicely driven off the front foot, but mid-off gets down swiftly to his left and stops any runsIreland have made a very positive start. Sourav Ganguly reckons that this is the best any opening pair has played against India in this World Cup. And that includes games versus Pakistan and South Africa, not to forget West Indies
IRELAND:4.6 Mohit Sharma to Stirling, FOUR, beautiful shot. Fraction short from Mohit Sharma, outside off too and Stirling stood up tall to force that through cover, no chance for the chasing fielder

IRELAND:4.3 Mohit Sharma to Porterfield, 1 run, angling in, Porterfield defends and the ball runs off the inside half of the bat to deep backward square legNow round the wicket with two slips still in placeDhoni has turned to Mohit Sharma, in order to bring some control. Very early though

There was a chance of another run as the ball ricocheted away, but they are happy with oneMohit Sharma, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
IRELAND:3.6 Shami to Stirling, 1 run, good drop and run single. Pushed into the gap at short mid-wicket, Porterfield was a bit slow off the blocks, but they complete the single very easily
IRELAND:3.5 Shami to Stirling, no run, back of a length outside off, Stirling shoulders arms
IRELAND:3.4 Shami to Stirling, SIX, Stirling has gotten off the mark with a magnificent pull shot. Dug in short, sat up nicely for Stirling to pull and he met the ball brilliantly, sending the ball into the deep mid-wicket area. He is a very good puller and cutter, and we just saw evidence of that there
IRELAND:3.3 Shami to Stirling, no run, pitched up outside off, was there for the drive, but Stirling mistimes it to mid-off
IRELAND:3.2 Shami to Stirling, no run, short of length on off, defended to cover
IRELAND:3.1 Shami to Porterfield, 1 run, Mohit does well and prevents the second. Punched wide of him at mid-off, he races across and then slides to pick the ball up and throw it back to the bowler's end
IRELAND:2.6 U Yadav to Porterfield, 1 run, pushed in front and wide of mid-off, quick single taken

IRELAND:2.4 U Yadav to Porterfield, no run, angles this one outside off, left alone
IRELAND:2.3 U Yadav to Porterfield, FOUR, now he unfurls a fabulous off-drive. Alastair Cook-esque. From Porterfield. He leans forward and just pushes the very full ball past mid-off, the fast outfield is on display as the ball races away. Yadav has bowled short and full and has been punished both times
IRELAND:2.2 U Yadav to Porterfield, SIX, that is a cracking pull. Maybe Porterfield knew the short ball was coming. He was in position very early and sent the pull way back into the grassy banks over deep square leg. Connected with the shot, from the meat of the bat. A statement of intent from the Irish captain early on
IRELAND:2.1 U Yadav to Porterfield, no run, swing for Yadav, but wrong line, starts middle and goes down leg, Porterfield can't connect on the flick, the ball rolls off the pad and Dhoni collects
IRELAND:1.6 Shami to Stirling, no run, pitched up outside off, Stirling gets forward and defends solidly to cover

IRELAND:0.5 U Yadav to Porterfield, no run, back of a length outside off, rising too, Porterfield shoulders arms. Carries nicely to Dhoni
IRELAND:0.4 U Yadav to Porterfield, FOUR, Porterfield gave that everything and it has flown to the third man fence. Width outside off and Porterfield slashed, got a thick edge that went over the slip cordon, two bounces and over the ropes. Porterfield is off the mark with that shot
IRELAND:0.3 U Yadav to Porterfield, no run, back of a length outside off, Porterfield stands tall and defends to cover
IRELAND:0.2 U Yadav to Porterfield, no run, back of a length and on the hips, Porterfield misses the nudge and is hit on the stomach

Porterfield is on strike. U Yadav will open the attackThe players are out there in the middle. Lots of beating of the drums. Porterfield on strike. Umesh the bowlerThe teams make their way out for the anthems. "Ireland's Call" will be followed by India's "Jana Gana Mana."Pitch Report: "The pitch looks very good. It looks flat. There is a hint of grass but because of the sun, I don't think it will be an issue. Maybe, when the sun goes down the fast bowlers might get a bit of assistance. It should be a very good battle. I think we are in for a very good game with lots of runs today," reckons Sunil Gavaskar.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit SharmaIreland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Andrew Balbirnie, Niall O'Brien, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, George Dockrell, Alex Cusack, Stuart ThompsonIreland have won the toss and have opted to batDhoni: "The conditions are slightly different, the outfields are smaller over here (talking about the difference in conditions between New Zealand and Australia). But, from the last tour what we have learned is, the wickets are pretty good. It comes on nicely and it remains the same. There is not a lot of changes apart from the fact that you have to adjust to the outfield being slightly smaller when you compare it to Australian soil. We were looking to bowl first. In this tournament so far there have been fair instances where we have put runs on the board. The last game was the only one where we chased (Dhoni forgot about the game against UAE), so it gives us another opportunity to chase a score. I think this is to some extent is the slowest New Zealand wicket. It's one place where the spinners get a bit of assistance. It's not a lot of assistance, but still they love to bowl over here. Apart from that, it's a good atmosphere whenever we play in New Zealand, it's a lovely beautiful place. We are going in with the same squad. We just want to go ahead with the good work that we have been doing. Also at the same time, it gives the team that settled time. They need to do what they need to do, but at the same time it gives them good exposure."Porterfield: "It's a great place to be, obviously three from four (wins). We are looking forward to today and we will be trying for two points. We are going to bat first. Looks a pretty good surface, so get out there and make first use of it with the bat. It's obviously another big game, two points up for grabs. We had a look at India. It's been a slightly shorter turnaround between games for ourselves, but that can be a good thing as well, the way we are going. We have to start well now and continue our good form. We have made one change, McBrine misses out and Thompson comes in."Our man, Jamie Alter, is at the ground and he says it's sold out, "Warm afternoon here in Hamilton, the CWC theme song is playing on the PA, the Indian fans have been here for a while, decked up in all sorts of outfits, Sudhir Gautam has blown his conch shell, taken photos with fans, and there are a scattering of Ireland supporters too. A good afternoon for cricket."William Porterfield - "Obviously, we've got to try to restrict them with the ball and take wickets." Porterfield's mantra to win against IndiaQuotes: Mohit Sharma - "If you are a fast bowler, you do tend to bowl bouncers." Talking about his repeated use of the short ball in this tournamentWeather update: Conditions for the game are expected to be fine. It may be a bit overcast, but there is no rain predicted on the day of the match.Ireland: Andy McBrine may play as the second spinner considering the small dimensions of the ground at Seddon Park. So that means Ireland too may go in with an unchanged side for this game.Pre-match team news, India: India are likely to go in unchanged from their previous game. Having already qualified for the quarter-finals, India could've tested their bench strength but Dhoni isn't too keen on doing that."It's a nice position to be in. It's one we want to be in. The quarter-finals is a goal we set ourselves before we came here, so we're in a nice position now, but it doesn't count for anything if we don't keep getting good performances," said Porterfield.Some news from the Irish camp ahead of the game, with captain William Porterfield terming this match "like any other game." "We've gotten into each game with two points up for grabs, and tomorrow isn't any different," he told reporters on Monday. "We've approached each game with great clarity and great professionalism really from our point of view, and we've prepared very well. It's a quicker turn around now from this game than from what we've necessarily had before, but it's a good place as I said before, that we're in, and we've got to start fresh tomorrow and come start time. So like any other game we're going into it looking for a win, and we're looking to make it four out of five tomorrow."One man who has quietly slipped into his role without any fuss is the vastly under-rated Indian seamer Mohit Sharma. He has six wickets in four games at a superb economy of 3.90 to support Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. "My role is very simple. When Shami and Umesh create that pressure, I have to maintain that pressure. I have to maintain that pressure for Ashwin and Jadeja too," he said on Monday. "The way Shami and Umesh bhai are bowling has helped me a lot. They have been bowling really well and have been able to exert a lot of pressure up front. My job is to maintain that pressure, so that Ashwin and Jadeja are benefitted from it later. So it helps me a lot that the batsmen are under pressure and my job then will be to bowl to my strengths; that I have been doing for the last 10 years. I just have to maintain my line and length and bowl according to the wicket."Dhoni wanted Jadeja to come to the party, saying "Jadeja will have to step up. I feel his slot is very important if he starts scoring runs consistently for us." He continued - "Even though Jadeja is not performing really well as a batsman, he still gives you that comfort at six or seven and it looks like a slightly better side. We also have to keep in mind the over rate because a lot of people dig into the stats. Someone told me whenever we have played with four fast bowlers, 90 percent of the time we lose and 100 percent of the time the captain gets banned. It becomes a difficult one, but at the same time as I said, hopefully the spinners, they would have learned from the last outing in New Zealand."India were tested for the first time in the tournament after three convincing wins. It was a good workout for the Indian side ahead of the knockouts. Sourav Ganguly certainly feels the same way. He had this to say, writing in his column: "It was a very good win for India against West Indies yesterday and when I say it was a very good win, there are reasons for it. The wins against South Africa and Pakistan were brilliant, but it was a hard-fought win yesterday. When you go through such a long tournament, you need this type of win to actually get the train back on track or the team back on track. I think India were outstanding yesterday. They lost the toss for the first time against a big team and I thought it was a good test for India. This World Cup has been all about teams batting first, putting big scores on the board and putting the scoreboard pressure on the team batting second. So, from that point of view, it was a very good workout for India."If the Indians thought they were in for an easier time, they had to think again. The West Indies, inspired by Curtly Ambrose's pep-talk at the start of India's innings, came out and bowled with fire and brimstone. They had India 6 down with still 49 needed. But MS Dhoni and Ravi Ashwin - with some help from Jason Holder, who inexplicably bowled Samuels and Dwayne Smith when, the situation was crying out for Jerome Taylor - steered India home to make it four out of four.So had enough of Ireland? Let's move on. Let's focus on India for a bit. On the back of three consecutive wins which included two over Pakistan and South Africa, India came into their game against West Indies at Perth as firm favorites. West Indies were bundled out for 182 as none of their batsmen showed application on a pacy and bouncy pitch. Only Jason Holder showed grit and made his second consecutive fifty of the tournament.Alex Cusack, though held his cool and took the last two wickets to make it three wins out of four for Ireland. They sit on 6 points and face India and Pakistan in their last two games respectively. A win in either of those two games will ensure qualification for the quarter-finals. But two tough games to come. But as William Porterfield said, their destiny is in their own hands.What happened in Ireland's last game against Zimbabwe? Ed Joyce continued his superb form by scoring a hundred and was assisted by Andrew Balbirnie with 97. A huge score of 331 was posted by the Irish. Brendan Taylor and Sean Williams fought for Zimbabwe. Sean Williams' catch by John Mooney was the turning point of the game. That catch had controversy written all over it as replays showed that Mooney's foot was touching the ad-cushions when he completed the catch. But Sean Williams had left the field of play - as soon as he got out and didn't wait - and that was the end of the story. Mupariwa battling on gamely, gave Ireland some nervy moments with 16 runs off 4 balls in the 49th over. That left Zimbabwe needing 7 off 6 balls in the final over.Now let's take a look at how Ireland have done in this tournament so far. Ireland once again showed why they are such a fine side, winning against West Indies after giving away 304. They comfortably chased that down, winning with 25 balls to spare. That set them up nicely for the remaining fixtures and sent a message that they were one of the serious contenders for a quarter-final spot.March 2nd, 2011 was Ireland's greatest night on a cricket field. Can they go one better? Can they slay another giant? This time - it's India who are waiting as we welcome you all to our coverage of the game being played at Seddon Park, Hamilton. If Ireland win today, they are assured of a place in the knockouts. What better incentive than that, to go out and play the game of your lives. So let's get started and rolling then.Have a read and understand this. During the 2011 World Cup, the ICC had decided to have only a 10-team World Cup for 2015. That meant no place for the Associates or any of the "minnows". Ireland's win over England played a significant part in ICC changing its decision. Eventually the 2015 World Cup was played by 14 nations, giving the likes of Ireland another chance to showcase their giant-killing skills."It's annoying in the extreme, but I'm not taking anything away from Kevin O'Brien and the performance of his life," Swann added. "It's the best knock I've seen in a long time. If a guy gets 100 off 60 balls [sic], a guy gets 100 off 60 balls. There's not a lot you can do, except say we should have bowled differently - and in the next game we will do. If we start panicking and thinking we're the disgrace that half the people on Twitter thought we were last night, there's no point in us playing."It was a completely different reaction from the England camp and understandably so. One man who was left shell-shocked by the result was Graeme Swann. "If we are going to win this World Cup - which we truly believe we can - we've got to go out and prove it, and we do that first and foremost in the field," said Swann. "Four or five days ago, the whole world was saying 'Oh my God, England can win' this - because we didn't get destroyed by that invincible Indian team. We know the fickle nature of the world, and we're going to ignore that and just carry on and play the best cricket we can."Ireland's winning captain, William Porterfield said the team was yet to understand the enormity of their achievement. "We got to let this sink in still," he said. "We've all grown up dreaming of moments like this in a World Cup, and we're going to enjoy this time with our family and friends and have a couple of drinks."Kevin O'Brien's father, Brendan "Ginger" O'Brien, was a happy man and he told the Belfast Telegraph this: "It's a hugely proud moment for me and I'm delighted for him. He had a couple of ducks recently but it is a hard game and he has come back well. We knew the wicket was good, the outfield very quick. Alex and Kevin were fantastic."The Irish Times's Emmet O'Riordan was all praise for Kevin O'Brien, introducing him like this - "Crash, bang, wallop. Hello world, I'm Kevin O'Brien and I can hit a cricket ball." Continuing on - "It was brutal in its nature, the pick of England's bowlers belted to all parts of the stadium to huge cheers from both the Irish contingent of about 200 fans and the locals, who enjoy both an underdog and a big-hitter. Kevin O'Brien jarred his knee and ankle fielding a drive from Strauss in the covers. Tough as old boots, O'Brien junior was up and running after a blast of the magic spray, although after what transpired later, police may be looking for a local witch doctor."The Examiner - an Irish newspaper responded with this to the win - "Memories of 2007, and comparisons with the World Cup victory over Pakistan in Jamaica will inevitably be made. But this was even better. England have hit their four highest World Cup totals in the last four games, are champions in the Twenty20 format of cricket, and are highly fancied to win this tournament. They are far better and more disciplined than the Pakistan side of 2007. Ireland have improved immeasurably since that breakthrough victory in the Caribbean. Thirteen of the 15-man squad are now full-time cricketers, and they are part of a 32-county squad that represents the whole nation of Ireland and sings 'Ireland's Call' as their anthem. They come with a self-belief and mental strength that sees them view results like this as just rewards."Ireland just managed to win only one game after their win against England. But they were more than happy to put one past their rivals. Rob Bagchi writing for the Guardian newspaper had this to begin his piece: 'Until Wednesday Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien was simply an Irish bakery firm, famed for its Toastie loaf and slogan "live life, love bread". For one day at least Trent Johnston, John Mooney and Kevin O'Brien have made the three names more synonymous with triumphant glow than dough.'England made 327 and looked well on course for an easy win when they had Ireland 5/111. Enter Kevin O'Brien or KOB as he is fondly referred to. He smashed the English bowlers to all corners of the Chinnaswamy as he recorded a 50-ball hundred - the fastest ever World Cup hundred. England were left shell-shocked by the brutal assault. England had James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Tim Bresnan, with Swann being the lead spinner. No-one was spared by the man nicknamed "Ginger" as Ireland went ballistic after the winning runs were hit.March 2nd, 2011 was an epochal night in the annals of Irish history. Playing against their arch-rivals and close neighbours, England, there was a lot of pride and history attached to the clash. Historically, relations between the two states have been influenced heavily by issues arising from their shared (and frequently troubled) history. So when the two met at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore, there was a lot to play for.The 1996 edition saw Kenya beating West Indies. That was a massive upset. Bangladesh did the same to Pakistan in 1999. In 2003, Kenya, against all odds performed impressively and reached the semi-finals - albeit helped by a walkover from New Zealand - with wins over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, far superior sides than the Kenyan outfit. In 2007 Bangladesh beat India in one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history. India were knocked out before the Super Eights and forced a legend like Sachin Tendulkar to have doubts about his cricketing future.12:30 Local Time, 23:30 GMT, 05:00 IST: The World Cups are the stage for the biggest upsets in cricketing history. It all started in 1983 when India stunned West Indies at Old Trafford before going on to repeat the dose in the final - which sent shockwaves amongst the cricketing community. The Duncan Fletcher-led Zimbabwean side came into the spotlight in the same tournament when they stunned Australia at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. The Australia side had the likes of Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Rod Marsh, Rodney Hogg and was led by Kim Hughes. Australia were definitely the favorites going into the game, but Zimbabwe came out trumps.Preview by Jamie AlterIndia. Unbeaten. Top of the Pool B table. The first team to reach the quarter-finals from the group. Defending champions.Ireland. Three wins from four, two by the skin of their teeth. Tied on points with South Africa, who thrashed them, and Pakistan, who they play their final league match against. Desperate to make the quarter-finals.Match 34 of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup pits these two teams together at Seddon Park on Tuesday, with India seeing this fixture as an opportunity to fine-tune a couple of loose ends and Ireland entering it hoping to put up a challenge from which passage to the knock-outs becomes easier.While for India this match follows four matches in Australia which they won, for Ireland this is a much bigger fixture. At fourth in Pool B with six points from four matches, Willam Porterfield's team are in a desperate battle with Pakistan and West Indies to secure one of the two remaining qualifying spots. After India, Pakistan remain. It is not, whichever way you look at it, an easy task for Ireland.And yet Porterfield played down the opposition by choosing to focus on what Ireland have done until this point, terming this match "like any other game.""We've gotten into each game with two points up for grabs, and tomorrow isn't any different," he told reporters on Monday. "We've approached each game with great clarity and great professionalism really from our point of view, and we've prepared very well. It's a quicker turn around now from this game than from what we've necessarily had before, but it's a good place as I said before, that we're in, and we've got to start fresh tomorrow and come start time. So like any other game we're going into it looking for a win, and we're looking to make it four out of five tomorrow."Obviously, we've got to try to restrict them with the ball and take wickets. It's just like any game of cricket and in this format the best way of restricting teams is taking those wickets. So we've got to go out there with that mentality throughout the 50 overs of taking wickets. Whatever we do of the first ten overs is going to be big, with the bat or with the ball, we have to start the game well and get into it."Being one point away from the quarter-finals was exciting for Ireland, but their skipper was not getting carried away. "It's a nice position to be in. It's one we want to be in. The quarter-finals is a goal we set ourselves before we came here, so we're in a nice position now, but it doesn't count for anything if we don't keep getting good performances," said Porterfield.After starting their campaign with a four-wicket chase of 305 against West Indies in Nelson, Ireland scraped past UAE by two wickets with four balls in hand, lost to South Africa by 210 runs and pipped Zimbabwe by five runs in a tense match in Hobart two days ago. They will know full well that India will not let them go. The loss to South Africa has dented Ireland's net run-rate (-0.820), and so getting big runs on board becomes imperative.One letdown for Ireland has been Kevin O'Brien, arguably their most high-profile player because of his stunning century that helped beat England in the last World Cup. The big-hitting allrounder has conceded runs at 9.60 and over, and in the narrow loss to Zimbabwe he conceded 90 in ten overs, of which 18 came in the 49th over. The opener and offspinner Paul Stirling has also faded away after he was named Man of the Match in the win over West Indies; he has tallied 22 runs in three innings since that eye-catching 92 and taken just two wickets. Ireland's bowling is their weak link, and the margin of error will be small against India.On a small ground, getting your lengths right will be massive. India's pace attack has performed very well in keeping teams to small totals - only once has an opposition scored more than 200 against them in the tournament - and against Ireland's batsmen, who are used to playing in seam-friendly conditions in the UK, they can be expected to use the same approach.Mohit Sharma, the seamer playing his first World Cup, spoke of the short ball being a method of wickets for him. "If you are a fast bowler, you do tend to bowl bouncers," he told reporters a day ahead of the match. "Yes, there is pace and bounce in these wickets Nobody expects my bouncer to come so fast because it skids as well. That's a plus for me because my bouncer skids a lot which catches the batsmen off guard and as a result there will either a top edge or they will get beaten. I have been hit for fours and sixes also off my bouncers but that's how it goes."India have most bases covered. They have bowled and fielded beyond expectation, Shikhar Dhawan rediscovered his touch, Virat Kohli marked his second World Cup with a fine century and MS Dhoni has led well. Mohammad Shami, Mohit Sharma, Umesh Yadav and R Aswhin have taken 30 of the 40 wickets, but the lower middle order is a bit undercooked.Suresh Raina, after a bullish 74 against Pakistan, has scored 28 runs in two innings, both times dismissed mistiming short balls. MS Dhoni deflected the question of Raina's continued struggles against short-pitched deliveries after the last match by terming it a media blow-up, but Ireland's seam-up attack will test out Raina. Ravindra Jadeja was called out by Dhoni in Perth to step up as a batsman - he has made 18 runs in three innings - which could throw into the mix Stuart Binny should India opt to rest Jadeja, more so because of his seamers which, under grey skies and on a skinny surface, will be handy to have.India and Ireland have met just twice in ODIs. In 2007, India beat them by nine wickets in Belfast and then during the 2011 World Cup in Bangalore, by five wickets. India's record at Seddon Park is two wins out of eight, dating back to 1981. Last year, they lost both matches here to New Zealand.
