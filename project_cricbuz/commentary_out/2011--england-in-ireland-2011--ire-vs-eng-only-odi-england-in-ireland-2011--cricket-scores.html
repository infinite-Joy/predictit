The toss should take place pretty soon.9:50 local time:  The rain has stopped and the ground-staff are getting ready to remove the covers. The weather is clearing and we will have a match.Bad news to start with though. I'm afraid that the rain is sweeping in over Castle Avenue and the players have had to flee the field without completing their warm-ups.The last time these two teams met, Ireland surprised England by 3 wickets in a high scoring encounter in Bangalore during the WC. Kevin O'Brien was the star of the match with a brlliant century of just 50 balls, the fastest ever in a WC match. The scenario has changed now though, England go into the match on the back of recieving the mace for becoming the new No. 1 Test team in the world. They have rested several of their stars who played a vital role in the 4-0 thumping of India. Eoin Morgan, the former star of Ireland will now lead England against his home country.
