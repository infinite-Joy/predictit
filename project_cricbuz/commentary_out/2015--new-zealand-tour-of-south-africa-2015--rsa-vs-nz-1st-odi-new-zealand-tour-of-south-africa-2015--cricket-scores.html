NEW ZEALAND:0.6 Steyn to Ronchi, out Caught by Amla!! The outside edge is finally held. However, the umpires are checking if it was a clean catch. No issues with Steyn's footing. Oh! This is a very close one for the man in the air-conditioned box. Did it touch the grass before Amla closed his fingers? Will the benefit of the doubt go to the batsman? Interestingly, Ronchi has crossed the boundary and is climbing the stairs to the dressing room. Looks like the third umpire is happy with what he's seen. OUT is the call! What an eventful over from Steyn. Nothing but an outswinging length ball just outside off stump, Ronchi looks to defend off the front foot, goes with hard hands, the ball takes a thick outside edge, Amla does extremely well to dive low to his left and grab it inches from the ground.

Fullish and on the leg stump, Latham flicks, doesn't control it, Behardien dives forward and tries to take it low but spills itLatham and Ronchi are at the crease. Latham is on strike. Steyn will open the attackWelcome back... South Africa are in a huddle. Bad news from the Kiwi camp, Guptill is not opening the innings after injuring his left wrist while fielding. Ronchi is partnering Latham at the top. Will Guptill bat or not? We'll keep you updated. The lights are lit and Steyn has a chat with ABD regarding the field placings. Here we go...The 185-run second wicket stand had put South Africa on course for a massive total, but McClenaghan and Milne got the yorkers right at the death as they chipped away at the wickets. Behardien and Wiese threw their bats around to take the total past the 300-mark. Sodhi also had a decent outing, though he didn't have anything to show in the wickets column. The pitch has a bit of bounce in it which will give Steyn and Co. something to work with. Join us in a short while for the run-chase....South Africa would feel they are 20-25 runs short after the platform they were given by the top-order batsmen. Amla and Rossouw were once again involved in a huge partnership. van Wyk departed after giving a quick start, Rossouw joined Amla and the duo started to construct a big stand. The former was a bit dodgy till he reached his fifty, but started scoring freely once he reached the landmark. Amla, on the other hand, was fluent right from the start, he outscored his junior partner and registered his 21st ODI hundred - levelling with Herschelle Gibbs for the most ODI tons for South Africa.4

Fullish in length, Wiese swings very hard, but only manages to get an inside onto pad, the ball stays just beside the pitch, McClenaghan picks it up, turns back and fires a direct-hit at the non-striker's end.

SOUTH AFRICA:49.5 McClenaghan to Behardien, out Behardien Run Out!! South Africa try to steal another bye but this time Ronchi and McClenaghan do well to send back Behardien. Another swing and a miss, this time from Behardien to a pacy bumper, Wiese runs for a bye, Behardien was late to react as he was on the back foot to pull, Ronchi threw it to McClenaghan, who then under-armed the ball onto the stumps at the bowler's end. Behardien run out (Ronchi/McClenaghan) 15(10) [4s-1 6s-1]McClenaghan to Behardien, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!

SOUTH AFRICA:47.6 Neesham to D Miller, out Caught by Milne!! The off-cutting slower ball does the trick for Neesham. Miller was never able to pick one from Neesham, he goes for the drive this time and gets a thick outside edge which goes straight to backward point, who takes a good low catch. D Miller c Milne b Neesham 14(13) [4s-1]Neesham to D Miller, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

A slip is in place..Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), James Neesham, Grant Elliott, Luke Ronchi(w), Colin Munro, Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Ish Sodhi, Mitchell McClenaghanSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Morne van Wyk(w), AB de Villiers(c), Rilee Rossouw, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, David Wiese, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Imran TahirNew Zealand have won the toss and have opted to fieldDuring the T20I series, South Africa won the first game, while New Zealand came back strongly to square the series. The hosts will be without JP Duminy and Morne Morkel, who are on paternity leave. Faf du Plessis still has not recovered from the injury he suffered before the start of T20I series. On the other hand, New Zealand have no injury concerns, they might be playing with the same side that played the second T20I a few days ago. With the teams sharing the T20I series, which way will the ODI series go? Stay tuned as the toss and teams are coming up in a short while....Both teams missed some key players in the previous series. South Africa were without ABD and Dale Steyn when they lost to Bangladesh, but the duo are back with the former also taking up the leadership responsibility. New Zealand, however, are still without Brendon McCullum - who has been rested, Ross Taylor - injured - and the new ball pair of Tim Southee and Trent Boult. Kane Williamson has taken over the captaincy duties and has done a good job with the inexperienced squad.The last time South Africa and New Zealand faced each other in an ODI, it was the World Cup semi-final. It was a cracker of a game with the Kiwis managing to pip the Proteas and book a spot in the final. Hello and welcome to the first ODI. Both teams come into the series on the back of some disappointing fixtures. South Africa lost 2-1 to Bangladesh, while New Zealand were expected to whitewash Zimbabwe, they scraped to a 2-1 series victory.PreviewAB de Villiers-led South Africa will look to fight a sense of painful deja vu and erase the scars of two recent wounds when they host New Zealand in the first of the three-match ODI series in Supersport Park, Centurion on Wednesday. South Africa suffered a heartbreak in the World Cup semifinal at the hands of the Kiwis and then endured a ODI series defeat in Bangladesh. Though the first fixture is being billed as the 'revenge' for the World Cup loss, De Villiers will be aware of the contrasting context of the first game of a bilateral ODI series and the World Cup semifinal his side bowed out of. Yet, the skipper, who was left teary-eyed after the Grant Elliott-inspired thrilling run chase in Auckland, will hope to get one over his World Cup nemesis. Date: 19th August, 2015Time: 04.30 PM ISTVenue: Supersport Park, CenturionWeather conditions: Cool temperature with partial sunshine expected.South AfricaThe Proteas' will be strengthened by the return of pace spearhead Dale Steyn, Vernon Philander and leg-spinner Imran Tahir, who enjoyed a successful World Cup campaign Down Under. Wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock's loss of form made way for the return of 36-year-old Morne Van Wyk into the T20 side, and the veteran now has the opportunity to make the ODI spot his own. The middle-order will be in for a shuffle with Faf du Plessis' knee injury likely to keep him out of action. Du Plessis' absence would mean the likes of Rilee Rossouw and Farhaan Behardien could slot in on either side of their skipper at No. 4 with the big-hitting David Miller and all-rounder David Wiese to follow. Young pacer Kagiso Rabada, who became only the second bowler after Bangladesh's Taijul Islam to take a hat-trick on ODI debut, could get a nod ahead of Kyle Abbott to bowl alongside Steyn and Philander. Aaron Phangiso, who was amongst the wickets in the two T20Is, may have to make way for the more experienced Tahir as the lone spinner. Probable XI: Hashim Amla, Morne Van Wyk (wicketkeeper), Rilee Rossouw, AB De Villiers (captain), Farhaan Behardien, David Miller, David Wiese, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Kagiso Rabada New ZealandWith Brendon McCullum still not available, the Black Caps line-up could have just five faces that was part of their memorable World Cup semifinal win over the Proteas. Captain Williamson will rely heavily on his opening partner Martin Guptill, who smashed 60 off 35 balls in the second T20I at the same venue, to lead his side's charge again. Test opener Tom Latham could be edged out for the number three spot with New Zealand giving George Worker an ODI debut. Worker impressed with a swashbuckling knock of 65 in his maiden T20I against Zimbabwe.James Neesham, who was nursing an injury during the World Cup, will hope to use this series to nail down his ODI spot once again and provide tough competition to the injured Corey Anderson for the all-rounder's slot. The series will also be a test for the 34-year-old wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi, who was disappointing with the bat during the World Cup. With Trent Boult out due to injury and Tim Southee rested, the series provides a good opportunity for the likes to Adam Milne, Mitchell McClenaghan and Matt Henry to showcase their potential to be regular picks in the final XI. Probable XI: Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson (captain), George Worker, Grant Elliott, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi (wicketkeeper), Colin Munro, Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Mitchell McClenaghan, Ish SodhiQuote"If the ball swings Dale (Steyn) will be challenging. It's a pretty abrasive surface so it's likely to reverse [swing] as well. So there will be some challenges,"- New Zealand coach Mike Hesson on the return of Dale Steyn.
