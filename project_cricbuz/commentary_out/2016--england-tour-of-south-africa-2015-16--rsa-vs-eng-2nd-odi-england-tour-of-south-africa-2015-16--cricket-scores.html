ENGLAND:45.4 Tahir to Buttler, SIX, and another! Somehow saw this coming. Tahir is having a horror day and Buttler just made it nightmarish. Connects the slog-sweeps and launches the projectile over deep mid-wicket

ENGLAND:43.3 Kyle Abbott to Buttler, 2 runs, there's two runs stolen. Rolled his fingers on the ball to bowl it slow, the ball rises off the pitch like steam and Buttler has enough time to pull it to deep mid-wicketSane singles should do it for England

ENGLAND:41.2 Kyle Abbott to Hales, out Caught by de Kock!! No. There's a Halestorm but it's from the Protea side to celebrate Hales' wicket. Atypical innings from Hales and looks like he has to be carried off the field with a crane. Happens when you fall one short of a well-deserved hard-earned ton on a pitch which's not your friend. Not anyone's friend. Short, tripe ball down the leg-side, Hales swiveled to help it with a pull, ended up gloving it back too fine and a shuffling de Kock gobbled it up.

ENGLAND:36.4 M Morkel to Stokes, out Bowled!! And Stokes has perished. A low, slow pitch has all but consumed Stokes. Back of a length ball robbed of all bounce, Stokes had his feet in a pot as he tamely pushed at it, the inside edge sneaked through the truck-wide bat-pad gap and made a mess of the stumps behind. 87 runs needed in 80 balls. Over to Buttler, perhaps? Stokes b M Morkel 0(6)M Morkel to Stokes, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!

ENGLAND:34.3 M Morkel to Eoin Morgan, out Caught by de Villiers!! Even prayers won't help when you manage to hit one straight to AB de Villiers in the deep. The ball was bowled off-pace, gripped and turned away as a Morgan amidst a dance out of the crease saw the ball far away from his reach. Extended his arms to reach out and clobbered it across the time sans timing. de Villiers sprinted across from mid-on, stuck out his left hand and snaffled it at deep mid-wicket. Slid to his left and then dragged his elbow against the ground to hold onto that catch. Eoin Morgan c de Villiers b M Morkel 29(28) [4s-1 6s-2]M Morkel to Eoin Morgan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

England are cruising. Eoin Morgan is switching gears while Hales is content to stay there and be there till the end. South Africa look short of answers and inspiration. Need a clutch of wickets.

ENGLAND:32.6 Behardien to Eoin Morgan, SIX, that is an even worse delivery. And Eoin Morgan had all the time to pull that for six. Horrible short ball, Morgan had to wait for it and did so, before slamming a six over mid-wicket. Carried all the way. That over should put more pressure on AB and South Africa. Not sure what Behardien is doing with all those cutters, which are banged in halfway down the track

ENGLAND:32.4 Behardien to Eoin Morgan, 1 run, another slower delivery and eased off the front foot to long-off

ENGLAND:32.2 Behardien to Eoin Morgan, no run, brave appeal from QDK. Eoin Morgan shuffled well across and missed the slog to leg. Did it hit him in-line? May have done so, but it was comfortably missing off. It was the slower delivery and beat Eoin Morgan for pace

ENGLAND:30.5 Behardien to Hales, 1 run, very full on the stumps, eased down to long-on
ENGLAND:30.5 Behardien to Hales, wide, QDK has the bails off in a flash. The third umpire has been called for. Hales looks at Eoin Morgan and nods, suggesting that he is fine. Replays are in and Hales is fine. He overbalanced on the flick and the keeper was quick to whip the bails off, but Hales had his wits about him and kept his back foot grounded. Third umpire confirms the not out call

ENGLAND:28.6 Tahir to Hales, no run, another googly, driven straight to the fielder at cover
ENGLAND:28.5 Tahir to Eoin Morgan, 1 run, very difficult chance and it has gone down. The googly from Tahir, Eoin Morgan didn't spot that, pushed out and got a thick edge, QDK had little time to react and I'm not sure on first glance whether he got a glove or not, goes to ground and a frustrating expression from QDK after the catch is put down

ENGLAND:28.3 Tahir to Eoin Morgan, no run, quick and flat on off, defended off the back foot

ENGLAND:14.1 Behardien to Hales, no run, this was surreal. Definite noise as the ball past the driving blade of Hales. de Kock was up celebrating and forced de Villiers to go up for the review. UltraEdge was heartless and spikeless and de Kock was left embarrassed. The onfield call stayed. Hales survives. Still cannot fathom where that nick sound came fromReview: South Africa go up for a caught behind. Hales is the man. Fair ball. Definite noise there...wait for the UltraEdge. NOTHING on the UltraEdge. No spike whatsoever. Not OutFarhaan Behardien, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack

ENGLAND:5.5 Rabada to Root, 1 run, a tap and run in front of point, quick single taken
ENGLAND:5.4 Rabada to Root, no run, Root gets away with one. It was speared in full and down leg, Root fell over on the flick, is hit on the boot and the umpire gave it out. Root and Hales had a chat and went for the review. Replays showed that it was missing leg. With the angle, it was going down. A good review by Root. But they took a leg-bye and the umpires got that wrong. Root shouldn't be on strike next ball, but he will be. They completed the run and then only the decision was made. Anyway Rabada and South Africa grimace after seeing that on the big screenSouth Africa are celebrating. Hales and Root have a chat. Root decides to review. It is given out lbw. So has to miss completely for him to survive. First replay shows that it may be going down. No bat. UltraEdge confirms that. Hit on the boot, so no issues about height. Hawk-Eye will confirm pretty soon. Missing and Root survives. The umpire reverses his decision

ENGLAND:3.1 Rabada to Hales, no run, length delivery and a solid forward defenceJoe Root, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:2.6 Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, out Bowled!! Cleaned up. That is a perfect comeback by Kyle Abbott. Right through the big gap between bat and pad. It hit the seam and nipped back in, Jason Roy had left a gap big enough for a truck to go through, missed the forward defence and the ball knocked out leg stump. Kyle Abbott is known to get seam movement and that is a good comeback after being hit for two fours. South Africa needed that. Jason Roy b Kyle Abbott 14(13) [4s-3]Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
ENGLAND:2.5 Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, FOUR, how did that go for four?

ENGLAND:2.4 Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, 2 runs, nips back in, Jason Roy gets forward to defend and the thick inside edge runs away to deep backward square leg, two they take
ENGLAND:2.3 Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, FOUR, fabulous shot from Jason Roy. What use of the pace. It was a back of a length delivery outside off, cramped Jason Roy for room, but he arched back and steered that well, wide of backward point. Third man had no chance, moving to his right. The timing was superb on that. The wrists did all the work there, he is a fine timer of the cricket ball, isn't he?

ENGLAND:1.1 Rabada to Hales, FOUR, cracking cut to begin the innings by Hales. It was fraction short outside off, Hales got on top of the bounce and flashed it past backward point. Third man had no chance. That's a positive blow by Hales and he is off the mark in grand styleKagiso Rabada, right-arm fast, comes into the attack

ENGLAND:0.5 Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, no run, pitched up on middle, Roy gets forward and defends it with a straight bat
ENGLAND:0.4 Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, no run, dropped! This fullish ball gets stuck in the pitch and Roy drives it uppishly, just to the left of Kyle Abbott who uses two hands to pouch the ball but finger-tips it away. Tough on the followthrough. They either stick or they don't

ENGLAND:0.2 Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, no run, drags his length a touch back and gets it closer to the stumps, Roy lifts his bat and lets it go
ENGLAND:0.1 Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, no run, fullish ball but way outside off, easy leave to the keeperJason Roy and Hales are at the crease. Jason Roy is on strike. Kyle Abbott will open the attackThe players are back out under clear blue skies. Abbott, on his comeback, has the ball to bowl the patented fullish length...Two slips in placeQuite a compensation this for Bloemfontein's rainy run-fest. Sunny skies to begin with and then a pitch which progressively got tougher to score on, thus sparing us another few hours of ball chasing. Amla was undone early by Topley who added another 3 wickets to finish with impressive figures of 4/50. du Plessis and de Villiers caged their naturally aggressive instincts to steer the total to safer shores. Though none of them could stay the course resulting in a late singlathon but they had done enough to pep up South Africa's total to something their bowlers could think of defending on a pitch not entirely a road. Join us in a few minutes for the chase4

On a length and armed with some width, Rabada RSVP'd to the invitation, threw his hands at the ball but could only manage an outside edge that was snaffled reverse-cupped by a backpedaling backward point.

SOUTH AFRICA:43.6 Topley to Rossouw, out Caught by Buttler!! Lovely one-handed dive from Buttler to his right to cut this off. Actually caught it and England have gone up for the review. Fair delivery, the ball slung in as Rossouw walked down the pitch to flick it, eked out an inside edge perhaps? UltraEdge replays are confusing. There's mini-spike but tough to say whether the bat-ball or the bat-ground impact led to that. No issues with the catch which seemed to have been completed cleanly. Long delay and Rossouw has been sent back with a reversed decision. Third umpire reckoned there was some wood on that and that's all. The end.

SOUTH AFRICA:10.5 Stokes to de Villiers, no run, length outside off, a sighter for de Villiers who lets it goAB de Villiers, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:10.4 Stokes to de Kock, out Lbw!! Review part: Will de Kock review? Yes he is. After a chat with du Plessis. Dharmasena has given that out lbw. Has that pitched outside leg? That's the only thing that can save de Kock. Looks like it has pitched in-line. No inside edge onto the pad. Three reds and de Kock is gone. Wicket part: What a good decision that is from Dharmasena. It pitched in-line with leg stump, de Kock missed the flick to that fuller delivery, played across the line and was rapped on the pads. Height wasn't an issue and it was going onto hit the stumps. Just about pitched in-line, but that will do. Stokes was confident and so was Dharmasena. du Plessis spoke to de Kock and after that discussion, went for the review. South Africa don't have any more reviews for the rest of the innings. Big wicket too for de Kock looked to be carrying on from his heroics in the first ODI. This man Stokes always produces the goods. de Kock lbw b Stokes 22(33) [4s-4]Stokes to de Kock, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Will de Kock review? Yes he is. After a chat with du Plessis. Dharmasena has given that out lbw. Has that pitched outside leg? That's the only thing that can save de Kock. Looks like it has pitched in-line. No inside edge onto the pad.

SOUTH AFRICA:10.1 Stokes to du Plessis, 1 run, length outside off, dabbed down to third ma
SOUTH AFRICA:9.6 Willey to de Kock, FOUR, very full outside off and de Kock won't miss out. There are four fielders in a ring on the off-side and de Kock has pierced them. Came forward and drove that past all of them. Brings up the 50-run stand as well. Willey is frustrated with himself and makes his displeasure known
SOUTH AFRICA:9.5 Willey to du Plessis, 1 run, full on the stumps, driven to the right of mid-off for a single
SOUTH AFRICA:9.4 Willey to du Plessis, SIX, smashed. Just went back and pulled it over mid-wicket. Fraction short and sat up to be hit, du Plessis was forward but transferred his weight and then pulled that over the fence
SOUTH AFRICA:9.3 Willey to du Plessis, no run, yorker on the stumps, dug out
SOUTH AFRICA:9.2 Willey to du Plessis, FOUR, du Plessis uses his feet and then drives that on the rise past mid-off. Went outside leg and creamed that. High elbow and all that jazz
SOUTH AFRICA:9.1 Willey to du Plessis, no run, that stayed a tad low, du Plessis bunts it to short mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:8.6 Stokes to de Kock, FOUR, again magnificent timing on that whip. He is timing them so well, off the back foot and through mid-wicket. A long chase for Adil Rashid but despite getting there and tumbling, he was in contact with the ropes as he had the ball in his hand. Given four

SOUTH AFRICA:8.4 Stokes to de Kock, no run, now arches back and steers to backward point
SOUTH AFRICA:8.3 Stokes to de Kock, FOUR, fabulous shot. Just a back foot punch and past mid-off. Stood tall and timed the pants off it. It was a back of a length delivery outside off and de Kock put it away with disdain. Terrific timing on the shot
SOUTH AFRICA:8.2 Stokes to du Plessis, 1 run, du Plessis inside-edges the flick onto the pad, the ball dribbles to the right of Stokes, a quick single taken as Stokes tries to run du Plessis out at the non-striker's end

SOUTH AFRICA:7.1 Willey to de Kock, no run, de Kock gets forward and punches straight to the fielder at cover
SOUTH AFRICA:6.6 Topley to du Plessis, FOUR, poor delivery and four more. Down leg with fine leg inside the circle, all it needed was a deflection which du Plessis got. Glanced that past the fielder
SOUTH AFRICA:6.5 Topley to du Plessis, FOUR, in the air and falls in front of the onrushing deep mid-wicket. The fielder goes for the catch and the ball lands in front of him and then goes past and into the fence. du Plessis used his feet and flicked it in the air, the wind helped him there, it held up for a while and then bounced in front of Hales I guess. He went for the catch, a good effort but Topley isn't impressed with that, he is unhappy that it has run away for four
SOUTH AFRICA:6.4 Topley to de Kock, 1 run, a leading edge and it goes wide of cover. de Kock early into the flick to a length ball on middle, luckily he gets away

SOUTH AFRICA:4.3 Topley to de Kock, no run, now the outside edge doesn't carry to Jordan at 2nd slip. The edge is found on the defence, but the slowness of the PE wicket has helped de Kock get away. Taken on the bounce by the slip fielder
SOUTH AFRICA:4.2 Topley to de Kock, no run, nearly a caught and bowled! Low full toss, de Kock was early into the flick, the leading edge looped tantalisingly over the leaping Topley. Falls short of the incoming mid-off too. Nervy moment!
SOUTH AFRICA:4.1 Topley to du Plessis, 1 run, full on the stumps, du Plessis takes one hand off the bat as he defends to mid-wicket, takes the single and there is an ironic cheer around the ground for that run

Pitches full around middle, threatened to shape in but didn't, kept going away with the angle, Amla didn't come fully forward, was late in attempting the drive, the ball brushed the back pad and then flicked the off stump. Amla walks back with a sorry look on his face. Topley deserved that wicket, for he kept the pressure on Amla in the opening over. Amla b Topley 4(8) [4s-1]Topley to Amla, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
SOUTH AFRICA:2.1 Topley to Amla, no run, tight length delivery on the stumps, Amla gets right behind and then goes back to defend to point

SOUTH AFRICA:1.3 Willey to de Kock, no run, big shout for caught behind. But the umpire shakes his head.

SOUTH AFRICA:0.3 Topley to Amla, no run, big shout for lbw! But a clear inside edge onto the pad. Dharmasena got that right. It swung in late and if not for a thin edge onto pad on the flick, Amla would've been walking back, everything going for it. Morgan checks with Buttler and then gestures to his bowler, that the batsman got a nick on that
SOUTH AFRICA:0.2 Topley to Amla, no run, length on the stumps, Amla defends it back to the bowler
SOUTH AFRICA:0.1 Topley to Amla, no run, that is a leading edge first ball! But along the ground to point. Pitched fuller on middle, Amla is nearly squared up but the edge rolls into the groundAmla and de Kock are at the crease. Amla is on strike. Topley will open the attackWe are all set to go. The players are out in the middle. Glorious day in PE. Not a cloud in the sky. Amla to face Topley. The latter has two slips in placeMorgan: "We would've batted as well. With the wind, it will swing today. Have to make use of that. Starting the series with a win is important. Stuart (Broad) hasn't played a game in over a year for us, also follows the continuity where we give the guys another chance to cement their spots. The challenge is to adapt to the conditions and the pitch here today."AB: "We are going to have a bat. Two changes for us. We back our backup bowlers but it is a good opportunity for Kagiso and Kyle today. Top 7 all in good form and we looked dangerous the other day. It is always a bit funny here at PE, have to take our opportunities and bat well today."Team changes: Kagiso Rabada and Kyle Abbott replace Chris Morris and Marchant de Lange. England unchanged.Teams:England (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Reece TopleySouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Rilee Rossouw, Farhaan Behardien, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to batThe bowlers managed to survive another assassination attempt but Stokes' stunning catch at long-on overrode all the runs and the pitch talks to steal the thunder. Rain though intervened to cut short the run massacre and in complete contrast, expect a dry and sunny day at Port Elizabeth. The pitch here is kinder to the bowlers and so expect the brand of cricket we are more comfortable with. Kyle Abbott has recovered from his hamstring hobble walk and is likely to feature whereas Chris Jordan's place might be up for grabs. Toss and team updates in a while..9:00am local: With the news that Jos Buttler has been sold for an amount just enough to buy a swanky sea-facing apartment in Mumbai, welcome to a world where bidding isn't the way. Players are born and they represent their nationalities in order to earn a win. Ironically, one of the parties in this match is England who're unfathomably infamous for fielding players born somewhere else. Runs aren't earned in any of the two worlds at the moment. They are looted. The other day, England robbed 399 on a pitch that could well be exhibited as the perfect specimen of a "road". Two players - Buttler and de Kock - scored tons, rivaling the ease with which you gobble up your chicken wings.Preview:With rain playing spoilsport in the first One-Day Internationals (ODI), robbing spectators and television audience of an exciting finish, South Africa and England will look to put an equally competitive contest, if not more fierce, on display in the second ODI at the St George's Park in Port Elizabeth on Saturday (February 6).Kyle Abbott is fit and could return to the South African side in place of Marchant de Lange, who was wayward in the first match. Kagiso Rabada will lead the attack alongside Morne Morkel. The conditions in Port Elizabeth should offer more aid to bowlers than what was on offer in the first match, best described by Eoin Morgan as 'a bowler's graveyard'.South Africa's batting line-up is good enough to chase down any tota;. But AB de Villiers's form ever since he has taken over Test captaincy has been a cause of concern. At the moment, Quinton de Kock's show in 50-over cricket, coupled with Faf du Plessis's consistency has made up for that."I felt we made a lot of mistakes. We weren't as disciplined as we'd want to be. So that is the focus for tomorrow, to try to hold the pressure a little bit longer," du Plessis said.England may have dropped Jos Buttler from Tests, owing to a poor run of scores. But he is showcasing a brutal exhibition of batting while facing the white ball. Ben Stokes, too, provides an enviable balance to the side with his explosive batting and effective bowling. How much would the auction that would happening in India simultaneously distract the duo, where they are expected to garner quite an interest, can be anybody's guess.Buttler, who is already surrounded by talks of the Indian Premier League auctions, said on Friday, "It's quite a strange feeling - you put yourself in the hat and you see what happens: I could be sat on my sofa in April."England are unlikely to make any changes to their starting XI. However, Chris Jordan's woeful form could aid his way out of the side.Much unlike the first ODI, it is expected to be a sunny day on Saturday, and batsmen won't be in for another run fiesta. There could be assistance for the pacers early on. But once the batsmen get used to the pace and bounce, boundaries wouldn't be too hard to come by.Teams:England (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Jos Buttler(w), Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Reece Topley, James Taylor, Jonny Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Chris Woakes, Liam PlunkettSouth Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Rilee Rossouw, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Morne Morkel, Marchant de Lange, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada, David WieseLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
