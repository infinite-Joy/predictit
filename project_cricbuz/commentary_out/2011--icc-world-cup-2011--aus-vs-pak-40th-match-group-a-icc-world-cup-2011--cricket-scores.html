Pakistan look set to beat Australia and end their unbeaten streak. They were the last team to do it and looks like they are on their way again. But as we have seen in this World Cup, the game can suddenly change course. And with Pakistan you are never sure. They were the original unpredictable team, until England usurped that mantle in this tournament. Still there is a chance for them to go back to their original ways. Australia will fight till the last ball. That's it from me (Srivathsa). It will be Ganesh to take you through till the next drinks break.
PAKISTAN:13.6  Tait to Shafiq, no run, this time Tait threatens to throw back at Shafiq after fielding the ball, a MAIDEN OVER!! from Tait, but never looked like nipping out Shafiq, Tait needs to fire for Australia if they have to win this
PAKISTAN:13.5  Tait to Shafiq, no run, Shafiq tries to cross bat the slap through the off side, ends up mistiming it hard into the ground
PAKISTAN:13.4  Tait to Shafiq, no run, Shafiq looks a fine young player, not only does he look good in attack, he looks impressive in defence as well, goes on the backfoot and then dead bats it near his feet, Tait is just bowling well within himself and not stretching to his full limit as of yet
PAKISTAN:13.3  Tait to Shafiq, no run, fullish, no swing for Tait, no seam movement too, this is now a flat wicket, driven to mid off with a full face
PAKISTAN:13.2  Tait to Shafiq, no run, back of a length with pace, accurate too on off stump, Shafiq defends from the crease
PAKISTAN:13.1  Tait to Shafiq, no run, nice way to loosen up, sharp bouncer, outside off, Shafiq drops everything in the way and then lets it goShaun Tait [2.0-0-15-0] is back into the attackRicky Ponting has always said that he considers the 'Wild Thing - Shaun Tait' as the real deal. He also said that he will use him only in short, sharp bursts. That's how Tait bowled in the 2007 World Cup and took a pile of wickets. Here he is back on to knock a few out.
PAKISTAN:12.6  Watson to Younis Khan, no run, full and on middle, Younis Khan gets forward and clears the front leg to drive, drives well, but straight to the fielder at mid on
PAKISTAN:12.5  Watson to Younis Khan, no run, once more, good length delivery on off stump, Younis Khan leans forward to block
PAKISTAN:12.4  Watson to Younis Khan, no run, stump to stump line from Watson, Younis Khan is solid and watchful in defence
PAKISTAN:12.3  Watson to Younis Khan, no run, short of length delivery on off stump, Younis Khan defends from the crease
PAKISTAN:12.2  Watson to Shafiq, 1 run, short delivery and not much pace, so Shafiq can rock back and pull it to deep square leg, another single
PAKISTAN:12.1  Watson to Younis Khan, 1 run, the senior man is doing it well, just nudging it into the vacant gaps on the on side and giving the impressive Shafiq the strike
PAKISTAN:11.6  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, solidly defended to a good length ball on the front-foot
PAKISTAN:11.5  Johnson to Younis Khan, 1 run, plays it late and opens the face of the bat to steer it wide of the slip cordon
PAKISTAN:11.4  Johnson to Younis Khan, no run, back of a length and slanted across Younis Khan who lets it go
PAKISTAN:11.3 Johnson to Shafiq, 3 runs, in my opinion Shafiq plays a lot like Rohit Sharma, that's how RS would have played that clip, delectably played past short fine, Krejza does well running in from fine leg to keep it to three
PAKISTAN:11.2  Johnson to Younis Khan, 1 run, David Hussey is on the field and he had a chance to run out Shafiq, the younger Hussey has a poor arm and that allows Shafiq to get away, dabbed to his right at point, Shafiq's ankle is bandaged and he is very slow to get to the other end, a definite chance missed
PAKISTAN:11.1  Johnson to Shafiq, 1 run, tapped to the left of mid wicket and an easy single
PAKISTAN:10.6  Watson to Younis Khan, no run, good length delivery on off stump, Younis Khan gets right behind the line to defend
PAKISTAN:10.5  Watson to Shafiq, 1 run, nice looking shot, only for a single to deep square leg, flicked off the pads
PAKISTAN:10.4  Watson to Shafiq, no run, Shafiq played that well, arrested the shot and made sure that the leading edge does not carry back to Watson
PAKISTAN:10.3  Watson to Shafiq, FOUR!!, the expression on Punter's face tells the whole story, as Watson came in to bowl that ball, he was charging in to field, anticipating that it will come to him, instead it is a poor delivery on the pads, Shafiq played the leg glance beating Haddin, fine leg had no chance, Punter after he saw the ball went away to the fence, let out a groan and walked back with disappointment on his face, he wants to win this badly
PAKISTAN:10.2  Watson to Younis Khan, 1 run, tight single and Younis Khan makes it with ease in the end, dabbed to the right of point, Steven Smith was the man, some confusion, initially, but Younis Khan hared across to the other end
PAKISTAN:10.1  Watson to Younis Khan, no run, tapped to leg, a back of a length delivery on leg stump, Younis Khan defends softlyShane Watson, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackThe bowling PP has been taken and it is the man with the golden arm - Shane Watson who comes on. He is a pretty dangerous customer - who will bowl wicket to wicket and won't try anything fancy. He will get it to swing and seam as well
PAKISTAN:9.6  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, full ball on off stump, Shafiq comes on the frontfoot and defends, end of a tight over from Johnson, a MAIDEN OVER!! in fact
PAKISTAN:9.5  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, fraction short outside off, Shafiq tried to hit that too hard, Shafiq mistimed the cut, hit hard into the ground, straight to the fielder at cover point

PAKISTAN:9.2  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, slanted across Shafiq who lets it go
PAKISTAN:9.1  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, full delivery on off stump, Shafiq gets forward and drives softly to cover
PAKISTAN:8.6  Lee to Younis Khan, no run, another backfoot defence from Younis Khan and Lee has a smile at Younis Khan
PAKISTAN:8.5  Lee to Younis Khan, no run, short of length delivery on off stump, Younis Khan stands tall to defendYounis Khan, right handed bat, comes to the creaseLee has finally got a decision in favor. Erasmus finally upholds his appeal. Looks out and it is out. Lee appealed thrice and kept on continuing his appeal. Finally Erasmus lifted the dreaded finger. Kamran Akmal went for the review, but he and Pak lose it.
PAKISTAN:8.4  Lee to Kamran Akmal, out Lbw!! Lee strikes for the second time in this game. He kept on aiming for middle and leg, Kamran Akmal was all the time confident that he would flick it away, without missing, but this one came back sharply off the seam and trapped Kamran Akmal right in front. Hit Kamran Akmal on the back leg and after a pretty long appeal, Erasmus gave it out. Would have hit middle and a good decision. No edge on that. Don't understand why Kamran Akmal took the review. Wasted. Kamran Akmal lbw b Lee 23(27) [4s-5] Lee to Kamran Akmal, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
PAKISTAN:8.3  Lee to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, short and wide outside off, cut away past point, hit deliberately up and over the man, Kamran Akmal will punish you all day if you bowl there
PAKISTAN:8.2  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, a huge inside edge onto the pads and Lee aborts the appeal, similar to the two appeals that Lee had against Kamran Akmal, but a thick edgeRight, we are set to go as Shafiq is bandaged up and looks set to continue. Perhaps the balm - Moov might have done the trick - that's the one that the Pakistani physio applied to Gul in the afternoon. Back to cricket.More drama in an already thrilling game. If Shafiq can't bat or continue, then it will be a blow for Pakistan. He looks to be in fine nick after scoring a fine 72 in the previous game against Zimbabwe. Still a lot of batting to come for Pakistan. Only Lee has bowled well for Australia. He was really pumped up when he took the ball to bowl. Tait and Johnson have been ordinary so far.
PAKISTAN:8.1  Lee to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, Pakistan and Kamran Akmal get a boundary, but Shafiq seems to have pulled up something, while turning back for the 2nd, he landed awkwardly on his ankle as he was seeing the ball and though Kamran Akmal got a boundary, Shafiq went to ground, the physio is out there and Afridi has a concerned look on his face, so does Misbah, one has to mention the committment shown by Mr. Cricket - Mike Hussey, he ran all the way from deep square, put in a full length dive and almost stopped the ball, the ball just about beat him to the ropes
PAKISTAN:7.6  Johnson to Shafiq, FOUR!!, Tait is one of the lesser fielders in the Aussie camp and he takes ages to bend down and allows the ball to go through his grasp at mid on, it was softly wristed to him, but the ball gained pace as it hit the turf and Tait after having bowled a couple of overs with the new ball, shows that he is already tired, that won't please Ponting at all
PAKISTAN:7.5  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, full ball on off stump, driven to cover, straight to the fielder
PAKISTAN:7.4  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, angled across Shafiq who lets it go
PAKISTAN:7.3  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, draws Shafiq forward with a full delivery on off stump, punched airily, but lands well in front of short cover
PAKISTAN:7.2  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, defended off the backfoot with an open face
PAKISTAN:7.1  Johnson to Shafiq, no run, lands short of slip, Shafiq looked to pull away out of the leave, in the end he poked at it, it took the edge and the ball landed in front of slipAtmosphere: The tension at the Premadasa is palpable. Both the sides are not giving away an inch. Lee - has already threatened to throw the ball back at Kamran Akmal three-four times. I have never seen him so animated on a cricket field before. The Aussies desperately want to win this. They don't want their streak to end tonight. This could be another cracker of a game. Don't go too far. Pakistan look good to end the streak. We will see.
PAKISTAN:6.6  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, good length delivery on off stump, punched off the front-foot to mid off, straight to the fielder
PAKISTAN:6.5  Lee to Shafiq, 1 run, full delivery on the middle and leg and Shafiq does not miss out, flicked to deep square leg, there is protection for Lee in the deep and only a single
PAKISTAN:6.4  Lee to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, rising from a short of length area, Kamran Akmal arches his back and then steers it down to third man, Kamran Akmal rode the bounce well that time
PAKISTAN:6.3  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, another back of a length delivery on off stump, Kamran Akmal is seeing it well, goes back deep into his crease and then blocks
PAKISTAN:6.2  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, short of length delivery and on middle, Kamran Akmal defends back down the track
PAKISTAN:6.1  Lee to Shafiq, leg byes, 1 run, Shafiq missed out on that, it was leg stumpish and Shafiq could not glance it fine, it runs away off the padMay 23rd 1999 - the last time that Australia have lost a World Cup game. March 19th 2011 - will Pakistan end the streak? Looks like a great game is on. Lee is fired up and so are the Aussies. Ponting who has not lost a game as captain in World Cups had an animated discussion before the innings started. He is up for it, as are all the Aussies. Ponting during the first over was jumping up and down when the pull went over Haddin's head.
PAKISTAN:5.6  Johnson to Kamran Akmal, no run, Kamran Akmal plonked forward to defend that, fuller length delivery on off stump, the bat face shut on impact and the ball dribbled back to Johnson
PAKISTAN:5.5  Johnson to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, a regulation half volley that and Kamran Akmal creamed it past cover, the fielder ran all the way, but escorted it to the fence, it was once again timed well by Kamran Akmal and he looks to be in good nick, good move this by the Pakistanis to send him to open the innings, for he is often wasted down the order
PAKISTAN:5.4  Johnson to Kamran Akmal, no run, short delivery and not much bounce on that, a ducking Kamran Akmal leaves that one
PAKISTAN:5.3  Johnson to Kamran Akmal, no run, good length delivery on off stump, draws Kamran Akmal forward and he gently pushes it to short cover, no quick single this time
PAKISTAN:5.2  Johnson to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, short and wide outside off, Kamran Akmal does not let go off that gift, cut away hard into the ground and past cover, it raced away, Kamran Akmal timed that well and another crucial boundary for the Pakistanis
PAKISTAN:5.1  Johnson to Shafiq, 1 run, tap and run, a bowling change as Johnson comes on, patted wide of short cover and both the batters hare across to make the quick singleMitchell Johnson, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:4.6  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, punched back to Lee who threatens to throw it back at a hapless Kamran Akmal
PAKISTAN:4.5  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, Lee is not happy, he shakes his head and walks back to the bowling mark after the original decision stood, it was full and it was straight, but the in-swing took it past Kamran Akmal's flick and hit him low down on the pad, would've hit outside of the leg stump, Erasmus gets it right once againWill Australia take the review this time? Ponting has taken it. Similar to the first ball of the over. To me it looks like it would clip the outside of leg. But that won't overturn the original decision. For it is not-out. I'm spot on. Kamran Akmal will survive. White did not want the review to be taken. All the Aussies appealed vociferously and the review was taken. Aus lose a review.
PAKISTAN:4.4  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, short of length and keeps a bit low, Kamran Akmal gets deep back into his crease and then defends
PAKISTAN:4.3  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, Kamran Akmal shows the full face of the bat and punches it to mid off, straight to the fielder
PAKISTAN:4.2  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, punched back to Lee who is clearly up for it tonight, threatens to fire the ball back at Kamran Akmal and then aborts
PAKISTAN:4.1  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, missing leg, full and fast, Kamran Akmal is done in for pace, is rooted to the crease and misses the flick, Aus don't take the review and rightly so, Erasmus gets it right
PAKISTAN:3.6  Tait to Shafiq, FOUR!!, sliding down leg and Shafiq plays the flick pretty well, gets inside the line and then times it past short square leg, hit out off the sweet spot of the bat and it sped away, Tait just walks back to his bowling mark in disappointment
PAKISTAN:3.5  Tait to Shafiq, no run, that goes on the bounce to Haddin as Shafiq shoulders arms and leaves, no pace at all for Tait in that delivery though he tried his best to hurl that in
PAKISTAN:3.4  Tait to Shafiq, 2 runs, worked away off the pads, nothing tentative about that shot, placed past mid on
PAKISTAN:3.3  Tait to Shafiq, no run, loose drive, full delivery outside off, Shafiq leant forward to drive and the ball went past the outside edge, Shafiq looks a tad tentative early on
PAKISTAN:3.2  Tait to Shafiq, no run, back of a length delivery on off and Shafiq gets right behind the line to block
PAKISTAN:3.1  Tait to Shafiq, 2 runs, that will make Ponting even more angry, he prides himself on being the best fielder in the world, it went to the left of him, that little finger on his left hand is the one that is giving him trouble, Punter failed to bend down and allowed the 2nd, fires in the throw to Haddin
PAKISTAN:2.6  Lee to Shafiq, 1 run, uppishly driven, but there is no gully and Shafiq is off the mark with a sliced drive
PAKISTAN:2.5  Lee to Shafiq, no run, strikes Shafiq on the pads and would've slid down legAsad Shafiq, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:2.4  Lee to Hafeez, out Caught&Bowled!! Binga! Lee is fired up and he strikes early on. He was unlucky in the last over not to get Kamran Akmal out. He has got Hafeez out this time. Extra bounce doing the trick. It landed on middle and hit the splice off Hafeez's bat as he tried to turn it to leg. A hint of a leading edge and what a good catch diving forward by Lee. He is a tremendous athlete and he ran in, before taking it with two hands. He sends Hafeez off too. That's the early wicket the Aussies wanted badly. Hafeez c and b Lee 5(8) [4s-1] Lee to Hafeez, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!
PAKISTAN:2.3  Lee to Hafeez, no run, full ball on off stump

PAKISTAN:2.1  Lee to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, Kamran Akmal nudges it down to fine leg
PAKISTAN:1.6  Tait to Hafeez, no run, beaten, it was on a back of a length outside off, Hafeez pushed out at it and saw the ball going past the edge, a poor shot from Hafeez
PAKISTAN:1.6  Tait to Hafeez, wide, very wide, the slingy delivery goes way outside off and White at slip sees the funny side of it

PAKISTAN:0.5  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, nearly a run-out, mad running between Kamran Akmal and Hafeez, Kamran Akmal was almost shaking hands with Hafeez, it was tucked to square leg, Hussey missed and another close shave for Kamran Akmal, a run-out chance missed
PAKISTAN:0.4  Lee to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, Simon Hughes during the post innings show correctly predicted that Kamran Akmal will hit a top edged four via a pull shot and that Pakistan will win by 4 wickets, the first prediction has come true, we have to wait for the second, what an awkward pull that was, Kamran Akmal was caught in two minds, ended up ducking and then half heartedly top edged the pull over Haddin, Ponting ran all the way thinking he had got his man, it was not to be, Kamran Akmal has a huge smile on his face
PAKISTAN:0.3  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, Kamran Akmal gets right behind the line and defends, Lee walks up to him and has a word as well
PAKISTAN:0.2  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, pitched up and moving away outside off, Kamran Akmal lets it go, shoulders arms
PAKISTAN:0.1  Lee to Kamran Akmal, no run, beaten on the drive, lovely swinging delivery first up, lured Kamran Akmal into the drive, flat-footed feet movement from Kamran Akmal and that nearly produces an edge, beautiful bowlingKamran Akmal and Hafeez are at the crease. Kamran Akmal is on strike. Lee will open the attackRazzaq: We are glad that we came out strongly and bowled them out for 176 runs. The pitch was a bit slow, but the ball was reversing and we bowled well. We were confident, we came out and performed well and we are confident that we will chase this down easily.Well.. who would've expected this from the Aussies? The Pakistanis have simply run through them. The Pakistanis had an obvious plan - to choke Australia with spinners and they did it perfectly by opening with Rehman. Gul and Rehman bowled a terrific opening spell, accounting for the wicket of the in form Shane Watson in the process. Ponting and Haddin slowly consolidated but Hafeez, who bowled a dream spell struck to remove the captain. Nothing went right for the Aussies as they had no answers to Pakistan's spinners and found themselves reeling at 134/5 in the 35th over. Razzaq came in as late as the 35th over but struck immediately with a couple of wickets. Steven Smith held one end and looked to take Australia to a decent total but Umar Gul and Afridi didn't allow any late heroics from the tail. Will Pakistan end Australia's unbeaten WC record? Or will Pakistan - the ever unpredictables make a mess of the chase? Join us in a while to find out..4
AUSTRALIA:46.4  Gul to Lee, out Caught by Misbah-ul-Haq!! That's 'The End'! It was coming back in, Lee was looking to go over extra cover, ends up slicing it in the air, easiest of catches at cover, 176 is all they get, and the Pakistanis look favorites to chase this down. Lee c Misbah-ul-Haq b Gul 5(8) [4s-1] Gul to Lee, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

AUSTRALIA:45.5  Afridi to Steven Smith, out Bowled!! Afridi turns to his left, looks at the Pakistani supporters in the crowd and lifts his hands in the air, trademark celebration from him!

Steven Smith b Afridi 25(32) [4s-1] Afridi to Steven Smith, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

AUSTRALIA:44.3  Gul to Krejza, out Bowled!! Dear Krejza, If you try to make room to steer a pacy fuller delivery from Gul, you are inviting death to your doorstep.

AUSTRALIA:42.5  Gul to Steven Smith, FOUR!!, fabulous! That's the power of this man, looked like he just carresed it through cover, but it went like a rocket beating the man at sweeper cover, first boundary after 107 balls and 67 minutes, it was a freebie from Gul, too wide outside the off stump

Steven Smith looks to drag it from outside off, gets a top edge and the ball goes over Kamran Akmal and out of his reach, well, he didn't try going after it, I think he should have, he had some chanceIt's been an unexpected collapse of the Aussie middle order, Ponting was stressing on the fact that they haven't been tested in the tournament so far, and when they are being put under the radar, they are showing signs of choking under pressure!

AUSTRALIA:8.4  Gul to Ponting, 5 wides, Kamran Akmal didn't have a Cat's chance in Hell to catch that.

AUSTRALIA:4.3  Gul to Watson, out Bowled!! Ian Chappell was saying that if Gul could bowl there he could get Watson out. A hint of seam movement and that crashed into off stump. A horrific shot it must be said by Watson though. The pressure got to him and he played a poor heave to leg, it nipped back in and went right through the bat and pad gap, clipped the top of off stump. A massive wicket for the Pakistanis.

He has asked for the physio to come out. Could be the slide that he did in the last over to save some runs that has done some damage. The physio is out and working on his ankle. No Shoaib, no Gul - if he goes off, Pakistan would be down and out without their two main weapons. Good news for all Pakistani fans - Gul is ready to go after the magic spray.

The Pakistani team is in a huddle and Afridi has a word with Gul who will start off proceedings. Lots of support for both sides at the Premadasa. The Aussie openers are out and we are ready to go. It's me, Srivathsa who will be starting off.National anthems time: First up is the Aussie one. Ricky Ponting is leading the way there too as he sings their anthem - 'Advance Australia fair'. Next up is the Pakistani one. Afridi with eyes closed, has a little nap before the camera pans on him and he opens his eyes and lets out a wry grin. Younis Khan as he always does is reciting it with patriotic fervour.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Umar Akmal, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Umar Gul, Asad Shafiq, Wahab RiazAustralia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, Michael Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Jason Krejza, Shaun TaitAustralia have won the toss and elected to batAfridi: Toss won't decide the match, the pitch won't change in the second innings, we want to get them out soon and chase the runs. We want to win and get to the top of the table, the boys are focussed, the dressing room is high on spirits. Shehzad is not playing, Umar Akmal is in.Ponting: We are going to bat first, it does look a good track, there is a bit of grass and the new ball will come onto the bat nicely. This is the toughest game so far, we have trained really well and I hope as the tournament progresses, it will get better and better. Bangalore was more pleasant, it is very hot here. We are going with the same side.Pitch report: The wicket is hard, there are some patches of grass on the wicket. It will be good to bat on and the grass will hold the pitch together. The hot and humid weather will also mean that the captain who wins the toss would look to bat first.Hello folks. A fabulous weekend in store for all the cricket lovers. While Bangladesh are fighting against South Africa for a quarter final spot, there is another big game about to start at Colombo, the underdogs, the unpredictables, the dark horses - Pakistan - take on a team which hasn't lost a World Cup game for 34 consecutive times now - Australia. As I (Ajith) bring you all the action live, something inside me tells that Pakistan will give the Aussies a run for their money today. Having said that, the Australians are known to be fighters, flawless warriors to say the least. Will they extend their winning streak? I will be joined by my colleagues Ganesh, Karthik and Srivathsa in a short while. Don't go away, we'll be back with more updates.by Saurabh SomaniIn the qualification stakes, this match does not hold as great a significance as an Australia-Pakistan clash might be expected to have. Scratch the surface though, and it is clear that neither will any of these two teams seek or give a quarter, nor are they about to approach the match with anything other than a full commitment to win it.
The losing team here will have a high probability of facing India or South Africa in the quarter-finals, and while both Pakistan and Australia aren't teams that lack self-belief, they would undeniably prefer easier opposition. Whichever team wins this match will top Group A.Pakistan: Shoaib Akthar is on his last legs and that should be reason enough for most teams to fear Pakistan even more. Akhtar loves the centre stage and the drama of a grand finale is likely to be irresistible to him. He will thus, spare no effort to ensure that the stage is grand, which means batsmen the world over had better watch out if he is included in the eleven. Pakistan have had one implosion so far in the World Cup when a Kamran Akmal-aided Ross Taylor tore into them. However, apart from that, they have been efficient sometimes and fabulous other times. Umar Akmal is fit again, and as their best middle-order batsman, his availability is crucial. Pakistan's opening combination has not been clicking, and it is vital that the middle order be strong when up against Australia's pace attack. With Umar available, the trio of Younis Khan, Misbah ul Haq and Umar provide a solid backbone. Bowling continues to be Pakistan's strength, though somewhat surprisingly their lead bowler has been Shahid Afridi rather than Umar Gul or Akhtar.Australia: Australia haven't looked as awe-inspiring as they did in 2003 and 2007, but despite that, they have been the only team to stay unbeaten in the tournament. The last time Australia lost a World Cup match was to Pakistan, way back in the league stages of the 1999 World Cup. Extending that winning streak will be Australia's first priority, and so far their bowling has helped them admirably. The trio of Lee, Tait and Johnson have bowled with pace and fire to unsettle all opposing batsmen. They can be taken for runs, as Hiral Patel of Canada showed, but more often than not, they have had the better of batsmen. Australia's hole in the middle order against spin has also been taken care of with the much publicized return of Michael Hussey. With Hussey and Clarke in the middle, and Watson at the top, Australia look good enough to overcome even captain Ricky Ponting's extended poor run with the bat. Australia have looked like a side in prime form, but that is also partly due to the fact that they haven't been pushed hard in any of their games so far.Head to Head:The overall Head to Head record is overwhelmingly in favour of Australia (52 to 29), but in World Cups, the two sides have competed on much more equal footing with Australia winning 4 and Pakistan winning 3 matches.Quotes:"I had some great duels with Shoaib over the years. To this day I always said he is the fastest bowler I have faced in international cricket." - Ricky Ponting was generous in his praise of Shoaib Akhtar.
"We have made some plans against them because they are very strong mentally and physically, so you will see in the game we will do something new against these guys." - Shahid Afridi has his plans for Australia chalked out.
