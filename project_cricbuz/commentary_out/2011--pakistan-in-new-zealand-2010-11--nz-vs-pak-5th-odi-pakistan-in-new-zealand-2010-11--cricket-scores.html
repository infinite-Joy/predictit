We need momentum before the WC, we did not play well in the first ODI but we have bounced back well. The conditions are not easy here, but in the sub-continent, it will be very easy for us.Franklin: I am happy with the form but I could have got few more. I got out at a crucial time in the Batting PP but we managed to get to a good score. Our top order really struggled and we will be hoping that they strike form today. I have been working with Allan Donald and I have reverted back to my old run-up. My front arm is blocking me a bit and I have to correct that. Hamilton is a great ground to play and I enjoy playing here.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Jesse Ryder, Martin Guptill, Jamie How, Ross Taylor(c), Scott Styris, James Franklin, Brendon McCullum(w), Jacob Oram, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Hamish BennettPakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Shoaib AkhtarPitch Report: The conditions are overcast and there is a slight chance of a drizzle later on in the day. There is a good grass covering on this wicket and it has been rolled in. The pitch is hard. There will be some dew later on in the day and that will help the ball come onto the bat easily. The side batting first has not won a game since 2001.Afridi: The pitch looks good but the overcast conditions will help the bowlers at the start. Akhtar replaces Tanvir in the team. A series win here in NZ will be a big morale booster before the World Cup.Ross Taylor: The new ball will do something in the morning. Southee has been rested and Oram comes back. We are hoping to get some quick qickets and put Pakistan under pressure. Brendon McCullum will bat at number seven today. I am batting at number four and we will be trying some new combinations today.New Zealand have won the toss and elected to fieldBreaking News: Daniel Vettori is out and Ross Taylor is the captain for NZ todayNZ are plagued with a few injury concerns. Jesse Ryder was unavailable for the previous match while Vettori sustained an injured hamstring. Will they be available for the match today? The toss and action is just a few minutes away.Hello and Welcome to the 5th ODI between New Zealand and Pakistan at Hamilton. Pakistan are in the driver's seat after their thrilling two wicket win at Napier which has given them a 2-1 lead in this series. The Pakistani bowlers were outstanding with the new ball while the batsmen, particularly veterans Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq, stood up and helped Pakistan to victory. New Zealand, on the other hand, are continuing to struggle in ODIs and they will be desperate to reverse the trend at Hamilton. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.....Preview by Karthik LakshmananThe World Cup fever is raging high, and every single soul in the world has its own predictions. People across the globe have started predicting their semi finalists. While the predictions vary with each person, there are two common aspects; India features in everyone's list and Pakistan features in none. But far away in New Zealand, the Pakistanis are silently making a statement. Pakistan isn't called 'unpredictable' for nothing. They were whalloped by the home team in the first ODI by 9 wickets, and as expected, came under severe criticism from their homeland. With Misbah Ul Haq leading Pakistan to a historic series win, the pressure was on the ODI skipper Afridi to silence his critics. He did exactly that - with the bat, and his team followed with 2 consecutive victories. Neither the start to the series, nor their progress thereafter is new to them, and that is exactly why they are unpredictable. What they would be searching for in the remaining games is a factor very crucial in a tournament like the World Cup - consistency.New Zealand on the other hand, are becoming very predictable - for wrong reasons. The Kiwis have won only one match in their last fifteen attempts in this format. After a start which promised much, the home team has faded away in the remaining games and find themselves in a must win situation to keep the series alive. While most of their batsmen have got starts, none have gone on to make a match a winning score. The bowlers to their credit have done decently, but have been a victim of Pakistan's unpredictability at various junctures in the series. In Christchurch, they were at the receiving end of a hurricane innings from Afridi, and in Napier, they had no answer to a match winning knock from Misbah. With key players like Vettori and Ryder injured, their task seems even more uphill. Pakistan would want to shed their 'unpredictable' tag with a series win. New Zealand on the other hand will look to avoid their 5th consecutive ODI series loss.What they say.."His was exactly the type of innings we need. I think throughout this series he's been their glue, and we probably need some glue": John Wright wants New Zealand to learn from Misbah-ul-Haq."I think Shahid Afridi is doing a good job. We have no problems and whoever is the captain, we will go out there and play our game": Misbah on Pakistan's captaincy issues.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Kane Williamson, James Franklin, Brendon McCullum(w), Nathan McCullum, Daniel Vettori(c), Tim Southee, Hamish Bennett, Kyle Mills, Luke Woodcock, Jamie How, Jacob OramPakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Sohail Tanvir, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Abdur Rehman, Asad Shafiq, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Tanvir AhmedLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
