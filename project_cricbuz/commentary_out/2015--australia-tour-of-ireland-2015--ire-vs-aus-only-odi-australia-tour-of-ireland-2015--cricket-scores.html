It's nice and sunny out there.17:30 Local Time, 16:30 GMT, 22:00 IST: Here's the revised target. Ireland will need to score 195 runs from 27 overs.17:15 Local Time, 16:15 GMT, 21:45 IST: Ireland will begin their chase at 17:40 local time. We are waiting for the revised target and the number of overs remaining17:00 Local Time, 16:00 GMT, 21:30 IST: It's bright and sunny now. The supersoppers are doing their work. We might be in for a thrilling chase..Wickets fell at regular intervals with Tim Murtagh grabbing two. Off-Spinner, Andy McBrine, kept one end tight and finished with remarkable figures of 1/40 from his nine overs. George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell flopped, while Steve Smith and Mitchell Marsh failed to convert their starts into bigger knocks. Australia had slumped from 139/0 to 222/6 - allowing the hosts to stage a remarkable comeback.Australia will not be happy with their effort, especially having got off to a great start. Interestingly, with a bit of cloud cover, Steve Smith opted to bat but both David Warner and debutant Joe Burns - 207th player to represent Australia in ODIs - justified the captain's call by sharing a century opening stand. Burns became the 13th Aussie to record a fifty on debut, while Warner registered his 11th in ODIs. The duo added 139 runs for the first wicket before Burns was dismissed - caught at the wicket off Craig Young. David Warner followed him soon after and none of the other batsmen - barring Shane Watson, made an effort to spend time in the middle.16:25 Local Time, 15:25 GMT, 20:55 IST: Australia's innings is over. The umpires will have an inspection at 17:00 local time, weather permitting. Ireland's target will be revised by D/L method.16:20 Local Time, 15:20 GMT, 20:50 IST: Right, the rain has cleared and the groundstaff are hard at work. If Australia's innings doesn't resume, Ireland's target will be 248, if they bat for 40 overs.15:45 Local Time, 14:45 GMT, 20:15 IST: The entire square is being protected. The rain is not all that heavy but it is steady enough. Looks like that blue patch in the sky is disappearing as well. As I typed that, it has started to bucket down.15:42 Local Time, 14:42 GMT, 20:12 IST: The rain is quite heavy now and the players are rushing off the field. A few kids help the groundsmen out to bring out the covers. As I said earlier, there is a dark cloud over the ground. Will that be the end of the Australian innings? However, one can see a bit of blue sky around at the other end of the ground.4

Hopefully, we will have a full game.It's that annual fixture where Ireland face a nation visiting the United Kingdom for an ODI. Still smarting from their Ashes defeat, the Australians will be looking to put up a better show in the shorter formats of the game. This will be their first ODI since winning the World Cup, can they keep the winning streak going? On the other hand, Ireland are one of those associates who have been dumped out by the big boys, and their participation in the 2019 World Cup is under cloud. Can they prove themselves today? Hello and a warm welcome to the one-off ODI between Australia and Ireland.Preview:Australia play their first one-day international as world champions in Belfast on Thursday with a new captain and three uncapped players in the 14-man squad against a spirited Ireland side that captured the imagination of the cricketing fraternity at the 50-over World Cup earlier this year.Although their World Cup victory was just five months ago, it will be Steve Smith leading Australia, not Michael Clarke and Matthew Wade keeping wickets instead of Brad Haddin who has retired from one-day cricket.The newcomers for Australia are Joe Burns, who is in line to replace Aaron Finch at the top of the order while the World Cup opener recovers from a fractured foot, all-rounder Marcus Stoinis who comes in for the suspended James Faulkner, and Ashton Agar, the sole specialist spinner in the squad replacing Xavier Doherty.Five of the World Cup-winning team and eight of the squad are still around despite Mitchell Johnson and Josh Hazlewood being sent home to prepare for the domestic season, leaving the world No. 1 ODI bowler Mitchell Starc to lead the attack.Three years ago, on their last visit to Belfast, rain washed out the game after just 10.4 overs but not before Pat Cummins was clocked at 94mph, and with Nathan Coulter-Nile and James Pattinson both returning to the squad for the first time this year, Cummins (22), who took five wickets in his two World Cup games, will likely share the new ball with Starc.Shane Watson may have lost his Test place but he is still a key member of the one-day squad, along with Glenn Maxwell who is the only Australia batsman in the world's ODI top-10, just ahead of former captain George Bailey with Smith down at 13th place. Maxwell, at No 70, rated the second best Australia bowler in this squad, so they have much to prove.The game against Ireland, the leading Associate nation which defeated West Indies and Zimbabwe at this year's World Cup, may be seen as a 'warm-up' for the five-match series against England which starts next week but the world champions will have to be fully focused against an experienced team which revels in the underdogs tag.Captain William Porterfield is one of six playing regular county cricket while Andrew Balbirnie, who scored 97 in the Zimbabwe win, and slow-left-armer George Dockrell are with Middlesex and Somerset respectively. All 13 were in the World Cup squad as new coach John Bracewell, the former New Zealand off-spinner who took over from Phil Simmons, eases himself into the job.Five years ago, in Dublin, Porterfield and Paul Stirling put on 80 for the first wicket, in reply to Australia's 231 for nine, giving their much-fancied opponents a scare or two. However, the introduction of James Hopes sparked a collapse which saw all 10 wickets fall for 112. If Ireland get into the same position again, they will be better-equipped and more confident of finishing the job this time.Teams:Australia (From): David Warner, Joe Burns, Steven Smith(c), Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, George Bailey, Matthew Wade(w), Ashton Agar, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Shane Watson, James Pattinson, Marcus StoinisIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Kevin O'Brien, Gary Wilson(w), John Mooney, George Dockrell, Tim Murtagh, Craig Young, Stuart Thompson, Andy McBrineLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
