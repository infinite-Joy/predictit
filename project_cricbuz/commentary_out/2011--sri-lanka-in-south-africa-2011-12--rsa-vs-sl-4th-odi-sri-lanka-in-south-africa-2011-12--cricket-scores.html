Tharanga is on strike. Morne Morkel will open the attackWelcome back to the Sri Lankan batting. Kimberley has a reputation of being a ground where targets are chased down most of the time. Can Sri Lanka chase this target down and boost their morale?Sri Lanka have done very well to fight back into the game. The last twenty overs yielded 100 runs for the loss of 4 wickets. When AB de Villiers was going strong, South Africa seemed to be well on course for a total nearing the 350 mark. Thissara Perera bowled well in the middle overs and the loss of wickets at regular intervals hurt South Africa badly. Sri Lanka will back themselves to chase this down. Both teams will also be having an eye on the run-rate. The Duckworth/Lewis system could come into play once more if rain intervenes. Join us in a while to find out what happens in the chase.4

SOUTH AFRICA:0.3  Malinga to Petersen, wide, oops, Malinga's radar goes awry, he tries to attempt the slow yorker, but he dishes out a loopy full toss that dips on Petersen, but it slides past the leg stump and a wide is givenOnly one slip in place now.
SOUTH AFRICA:0.2  Malinga to Petersen, 2 runs, back of a length delivery and straight just outside off, Petersen stays on the crease and just pushes it past the gap at point, the ball just races across this outfield and a couple results
SOUTH AFRICA:0.1  Malinga to Petersen, no run, Malinga gets some movement immediately, short of length ball and it cuts away outside off, Petersen dabs it to point, slight misfield from the fielder but they do not risk a singlePetersen and Graeme Smith are at the crease. Petersen is on strike. Malinga will open the attackTwo slips in place as Malinga charges in.Right, both the teams are lined up for their national anthems. First is the South African national anthem. Well, apparently, they have not played the Sri Lankan anthem. Strange!Mathews: I thought we had a great chance to win the previous match. Unfortunately, rain spoiled our party. We understand the disappointment of the people but it has been a tough six months for the team. We are trying our best but we have not been able to win any series. If we win the remaining matches, we will be very happy. Mahela's injury is a blow as he is a world-class player. Playing in South Africa is tough and we have not played good cricket. We will go out and play good cricket in this match.Parnell: It is great to come back into the team. I was just coming back from injury and I am working on my fitness. In ODI cricket, the team has identified certain aspects and I fit into one of those aspects. Dale is the No.1 bowler and I am here to play my role and give the best for South Africa. I am working hard on my batting and I must thank the Warriors for promoting me up the order. Our goal is to win this series 5-0.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith, Alviro Petersen, Colin Ingram, AB de Villiers(w/c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Robin Peterson, Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Wayne ParnellSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Thissara Perera, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Sachithra SenanayakePitch Report: There is a breeze blowing around. Boeta Dippenaar reckons that this is a boundary hitting ground. The side batting second has won 80% of the matches at Kimberly. There is a threat of rain later on. The wicket will be on the slower side. There is a bit more grass and the ball will carry a bit better. There will also be a bit more pace on this ball. Anything in the vicinity of 250 is a good score on this wicket.South Africa have won the toss and elected to batDilshan: I would have also batted first. I am just telling the guys to be confident. We have played good cricket but some things have not gone our way. We have three changes. Prasad is out and Thissara Perera comes in. Mahela Jayawardene is injured and Kosala Kulasekara are out. It is time for the youngsters to step in and perform.AB de Villiers: I was a little bit confused whether to bat first. It looks like a good wicket to bat on and we want to put pressure on SL. I am enjoying my captaincy. Albie Morkel and Dale Steyn are resting and Philander and Parnell are coming in.Welcome to the 4th ODI between South Africa and Sri Lanka from Kimberley. South Africa have already clinched the series and they will want to dominate the remaining two matches and end their summer on a high. Nothing has gone right for Sri Lanka after their historic Test win at Durban. The batting has lacked consistency while the bowlers have struggled to achieve penetration. Sri Lanka will want to register a win today and boost their morale ahead of their ODI tour to Australia. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Anoop NavalThe Sri Lankan cricket team not only has run out of form of late, but also found themselves on the wrong end of mother nature's tantrum during the 3rd ODI of the Sunfoil series against South Africa in Bloemfontein. The Lankan bowlers managed a couple of good scalps and looked like they would finally manage to make a comeback and save the series when rain decided to foil their plans by stopping by for tea and deciding to stay for dinner. The luckless lions probably went to bed cursing Duckworth and Lewis as South Africa won the match by just 4 runs. The worn out Lankan team have nothing left but to save face with a victory in the 4th ODI set to take place at the De Beers Diamond Oval. The Proteas, needless to say, will look to push Lanka lower by improving their series figures to 4-0.South Africa:South Africa have an amazing opportunity to test their bench strength as World No.1 batsman Hashim Amla has pulled out of the series owing to family responsibilities and veteran Jacques Kallis has been rested for the remainder of the series. Conveniently for South Africa, Faf du Plessis displayed brilliant skill during the 3rd ODI and made sure the Proteas were ahead at the finish line. His blistering 72 at Bloemfontein left Sri Lanka dumbstruck while Colin Ingram started off dangerously before being toppled by Malinga. Skipper AB de Villiers looked like he would take the team safely ashore anyway, when rain played spoilsport.Also, it would just be rude to ignore his innovative mind which has kept South Africa on top throughout the series. Demoting himself to number 6 to make space for Faf du Plessis proved to be the tungsten for his bulb. Du Plessis agreed, saying "(I am) very grateful to AB and Kirsten to have promoted me. The series win is a very big achievement for us.I was suffering from cramps and it became a bit serious. The track was playing nice and with AB there, we were very confident. We really want to make it 5-0."Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, and Lonwabo Tsotsobe have all contributed massively to RSA's success, but the team might also consider giving chances to Wayne Parnell and Vernon Philander for the remaining two matches. The South African men have also been very agile on the field helping their bowlers maintain the pressure throughout.Sri Lanka:One of the very few reasons that the Lankan team can be happy about is that their top order clicked during the 3rd ODI. Though none of the batsmen could bat longer than Upul Tharanga(58 off 65), all of the batters managed to get starts, which means that there is still life in the so far spineless lineup. Kumar Sangakkara managed a tasty 38 off 37 balls while Nuwan Kulasekara romped a quick 40 before being bowled out by Morkel. Dinesh Chandimal can always surprise the bowlers depending on the situation. Mahela Jayawardhane would want to make a plausible contribution to the scorecard at Kimberly. As far as the Lankan bowling is concerned, 'slinga' will be Dilshan's lifeline. Nuwan Kulasekara also managed to set a rhythm with Malinga, pushing the Proteas to 53-3 at one point. It will be up to Herath and the others to back the pacers in upturning the World No.3 teamFinal word:Proteas look for a whitewash while the so far toothless Lankans look to muster a win. A big score will be the key to the team batting first on a high scoring Kimberly pitch.Teams:South Africa (From): AB de Villiers(w/c), Graeme Smith, Morne Morkel, Alviro Petersen, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Johan Botha, Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Albie Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Colin IngramSouth Africa (From): AB de Villiers(w/c), Graeme Smith, Morne Morkel, Alviro Petersen, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Johan Botha, Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Albie Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Colin IngramLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
