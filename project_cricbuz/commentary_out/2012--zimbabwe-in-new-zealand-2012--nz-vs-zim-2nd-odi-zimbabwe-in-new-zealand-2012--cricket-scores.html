Nicol carried on and towards the end, he scored his second ODI century. He and Latham opened up towards the end of the innings as the Zimbabwe bowlers struggled to bowl in the right areas. They were not helped by some sloppy fielding and from catches being dropped. Zimbabwe have a mountain to climb yet again and one feels that this onslaught might have demoralized them badly.

New Zealand thumped Zimbabwe by a comfortable margin in the first ODI. Zimbabwe's batting woes have continued on this tour and they will be desperate to achieve a turn-around.Preview by  Anoop NavalHaving sailed to a 90-run victory in the first ODI at Dunedin, New Zealand will be looking to settle the series with a win when they take on Zimbabwe in the second match of the series at Whangarei on Monday. Zimbabwe, however, will look to work on the vital aspects of their game and come with all they can muster at a confident New Zealand side. The African nation will also be keeping their fingers crossed for lady luck to bless them with that rare charm they manage to invoke at crucial junctures and hope to level the series with a win.New Zealand:The Kiwis, formidable as they are, will have to take into account their failures from the first ODI. At a certain point of the match, they looked like coasting to a 300 plus total, especially before the 45th over where they were riding at 223/6. The sudden collapse of the lower middle order which left them all out at 248 might be a good point to start their correction. For a comparatively weak side like Zimbabwe to succeed in taking four Kiwi wickets for the last twenty-five runs must have come to the Black Caps as a shocker. Of a batting line-up consisting of dashing batsmen like Brendon McCullum, Nathan McCullum, Kane Williamson and newbie Tom Latham, New Zealand must also take into consideration that none of their batsmen managed to cross 35 except Martin Guptill who top scored at 70. On the brighter side, however, Rob Nicol put up a clinical performance with the ball to make up for his duck with the bat by figuring 4/19 in just 4.1 overs while Kyle Mills took 3/26 in 8 overs. If New Zealand are to make sure that they stay in their game, they will have to contribute with the bat and maintain the edge with the ball.Zimbabwe:Apart from skipper Brendan Taylor, none of the Zimbabwean batters have managed to hold their bats straight throughout the series. When one is up against a formidable bowling arsenal like the Kiwis, it is basic necessity to stay at the crease and make sure to put some runs on the board. Shingirai Masakadza was outstanding with the ball, gulping down 4/46 and playing the vital role in New Zealand's collapse. It will be necessary for the rest of the bowlers to take the cue and follow through if Zimbabwe are to give the Kiwis a run for their money. The most noticeable factor was their improvement in the ODI match as compared to the Test. The Zimbabweans need to keep up the ascent, but they desperately need to rebuild their mental frame and their batting line-up if a win is to come their way. Final Word:A desperate Zimbabwe trying hard to cement their spot in International Cricket. A confident New Zealand side that tends to get a tad over-confident and collapse at unexpected phases of a match. Both teams will benefit much by improving their technical flaws and giving the best they have. If this is achieved, the second ODI at Whangarei promises to be an exciting one.Teams:New Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(w/c), Doug Bracewell, Dean Brownlie, Martin Guptill, Tim Southee, Kane Williamson, Michael Bates, Andrew Ellis, Tom Latham, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Tarun Nethula, Rob Nicol, Jacob OramZimbabwe (From): Brendan Taylor(c), Regis Chakabva, Elton Chigumbura, Graeme Cremer, Kyle Jarvis, Hamilton Masakadza, Shingirai Masakadza, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Tino Mawoyo, Keegan Meth, Forster Mutizwa, Ray Price, Tatenda Taibu(w), Prosper Utseya, Brian Vitori, Malcolm WallerLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
