Warner is on strike. Steyn will open the attackWelcome back. No news yet about Shane Watson. Ponting goes one place up and will open. This promises to be an exciting chase.A great effort from the under pressure South African batsmen. They lost their skipper off the first ball but Kallis and Smith consolidated and put on a 100+ stand. Australia fought back by sending both of them back in successive overs, but little did they realise that David Miller will come in to grab the momentum back to the home side. He found good support in Duminy, who survived the tough phases and played the big shots towards the end, to take South Africa past 300. 304 will not be easy, and Australia may not have Shane Watson. Even if they have Shane Watson, he will not have a bye runner. But join us in half an hour, to see if Australia can seal the series today.David Miller: Very pleased with the total. The guys started off very well and gave us a good platform for us to go past 300. The wicket is quite slow and there is a lot of turn. I guess the cutters will be very useful towards the end. I just wanted to continue the partnership with JP and take the team past 300. Warner is due but we hope to stop him.4

Miller was quite shocked by the decision and reviewed it immediately.David Miller has been given out LBW. He immediately reviews it. Looks close. Impact outside off?

We have to lift our game soon, it is a lovely venue to play. We know that we have to win and there is good intensity among the boys.South Africa have won the toss and elected to batGood news for Australia: Shane Watson is fit and will play today. Hello and welcome to our coverage of the 2nd ODI between South Africa and Australia. The visitors are 1-0 up in this short 3 match series, and have a great chance of sealing it here at Port Elizabeth. South Africa still seem to be a bit rusty after their long break, and they need to shed it off soon or it will all be lost even before they realise. Stay tuned for toss and other updates.PreviewAfter being walloped in the first ODI against a strong Australian side, South Africa will hope to come back strong and level the series at Port Elizabeth. This is a make or break game for the hosts and they will be desperate to ensure that the game at Durban will not be a dead rubber.South AfricaSouth Africa had a match to forget in the opening ODI, being outclassed both with the bat and out on the field. Choosing to field first, the Proteas were off to a positive start before Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke put Australia in command with a superb stand. The hosts struggled to get back into the game after that with all their bowlers, including arguably the World's best Dale Steyn, going for plenty. Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe did well with the ball but had nothing to show for their hard work.Chasing a tough target, South Africa's power packed line up failed to light up the game, with none of the batters carrying on to make more than 30. They were bowled out for a paltry 129 to hand the Aussies a thumping 93 run win. Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla have failed to get the hosts to a good start so far in the series and the team will hope the experienced duo come good. AB de Villiers has been sorely missed by the Proteas and they will hope the likes of JP Duminy and Faf du Plessis make up for the star batsman's absence.Player to watch out for: Dale Steyn had a bad outing in the last game and will doubly determined to make a positive impact.AustraliaThe form shown by Ricky Ponting and Clarke will be a major boost for Australia, the experienced duo add a lot to the batting order and can now allow the like of David Warner, to bat with much more freedom. Shane Watson's injury would have been tough for the visitors as they bank heavily on the allrounder to help out with both bat and ball, but Ponting has shown with his hardworking innings that he is equally able of giving Australia the kind of start they expect from Shane Watson. Brad Haddin's outing too suggested that the horrible form he showed in Sri Lanka is behind him as he hit a brisk 30 to give the Aussies a good total.Their bowling too was spot on with all five bowlers picking up wickets and ensuring that the hard work done by their batsmen was not undone. Mitchell Johnson was the most impressive bowler picking up 3 wickets while giving away only 20 runs, Pat Cummins too picked up 3 wickets but he would want to cut down on the economy rate having conceded at close to 10 an over.Australia's only headache will be their weak middle order. Mitchell Marsh and Steven Smith cannot be relied upon to bail the Australians out of trouble and that will put a lot of responsibility on Clarke and Haddin to shield the weak middle order.Player to watch out for: Ricky Ponting did extremely well in the openers role in the first ODI. The team will be hoping he goes one better now and gets a hundred.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla(c), Johan Botha, Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Graeme Smith, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Mark Boucher(w), Jacques Kallis, Imran Tahir, Faf du Plessis, Dale SteynAustralia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Cameron White, Shane Watson, Doug Bollinger, Pat Cummins, Brett Lee, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, James Pattinson, Steven Smith, David Warner, Xavier Doherty, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting, Michael Hussey, Mitchell JohnsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
