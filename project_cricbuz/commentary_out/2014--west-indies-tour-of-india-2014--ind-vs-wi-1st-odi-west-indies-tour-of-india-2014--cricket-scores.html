West Indies are in a huddle. Skipper Bravo has some words of encouragement for them.West Indies have posted the highest total at this ground. Though they started off slowly, Smith and Lil Bravo steadied the ship for a while before both threw their wickets away. Samuels and Ramdin then shared a brilliant 165-run stand for the fourth wicket to put pressure on India. Samuels remained unbeaten in the end after registering his 6th ODI hundred. Shami went for runs but he bowled well at the death to end with four wickets in his bag. An interesting chase is on the cards. India will fancy their chances with the batting line-up they have. The shorter boundaries and the dew factor could help them as well. Take a break and be right back here for India's reply...4

Ramdin did well to carve this high full toss over sweeper cover
WEST INDIES:35.5 Shami to Samuels, 1 run, Samuels cleared his left leg and looked to go big over the on-side, but Shami cramped him for room with this delivery and in the end, Samuels could only mistime the pull to mid-on

Two slips in place for BhuviTeams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Mohit SharmaWest Indies (Playing XI): Dwayne Smith, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Denesh Ramdin(w), Dwayne Bravo(c), Kieron Pollard, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Sulieman Benn, Ravi Rampaul, Jerome TaylorDwayne Bravo: "It is a small ground. Let us see what happens later on. We had a very good series against Bangladesh. We have a couple of injuries, Narine is not there. At the same time, the boys are looking for the challenge. Simmons is yet to recover, Roach, Leon Johnson and Holder also miss out. We have to make the best of our opportunity. I am looking forward to it."MS Dhoni: "We are looking to bowl first. I still feel there is a bit of moisture. Play may get interrupted due to rain. That's (building for the World Cup) the key. It's not really experimentaion. We want to win the series. We are sure about our spinners for the World Cup. We will have to see our seamers. We play three seamers. The two spinners are Mishra and Jadeja, Ashwin is not there."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe two captains walk out for the toss.Both teams have done well in the 50-over format of late. India won the ODI series comprehensively in England, while West Indies crushed Bangladesh at home. After all the recent developments, it is a big blow to West Indies that Sunil Narine is not playing in this series. Chris Gayle's absence, due to injury, will also hurt the team's chances but having said that Dwayne Bravo's men have enough firepower to upstage any team on a given day. So, what will be the playing XIs of both the sides? We'll get to know in a short while as the toss is moments away. Stay tuned...Getting back to the action, the biggest news for Team India is the inclusion of chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav. The young left-armer grabbed eyeballs with an impressive show in the recently concluded World T20 League. Considering that he has got a lot of variety up his sleeve, is he on the radar for the World Cup? Is he going to break into the playing XI? That is the big question at the moment. It is another great opportunity for Amit Mishra, who returns to the Indian setup after being dropped for the England tour. Meanwhile, the selectors have rested Ravichandran Ashwin for the first three ODIs of this series.Pitch Report: "There has been a lot of rain but the groundstaff have done a wonderful job. It is clear right now but we will have some rain later on. There is a tinge of grass on the surface as well," Alan Wilkins. "The covers were removed just 10 minutes before and I think there will be a fair bit of sweating on the pitch. It will assist the spinners, but the ball would also come onto the bat nicely in the initial stages," Sunil Gavaskar.Before going into the actual match, here's a recap of the events that transpired late yesterday night. West Indies players were mulling a strike in protest against West Indies Players Association chief, Wavell Hinds. According to the West Indian players, Hinds 'hoodwinked' them and did not take them into confidence while signing the new memorandum of understanding with the West Indies Cricket Board. In the new deal, the players claimed that they suffered a significant pay cut. This wasn't the first time it had happened. In 2009, the players went on a strike over a pay dispute and the West Indies board played a weakened team against the visiting Bangladesh. Thankfully, for all concerned, it looks like the players have relented and they are on the ground right now preparing for the match ahead.It's the start of India's only home series of 2014. The West Indies are here to play 5 ODIs before they move on to other formats. Probably, this is the last chance that Team India has got to sort out their final squad for the World Cup in familiar conditions. Ideally, they will want to take the same composition to the tri-series Down Under, which will serve as a dress rehearsal for the World Cup.Preview by Bharath RamarajThe MS Dhoni-led Indian unit will take on a West Indies set-up missing some of its key players in a five-match ODI series starting from Wednesday. On paper, India seem to hold all the aces to continue bestriding the opposition ranks. It has to be remembered that the last time West Indies won a bilateral series against India was way back in 2006. However, as the cliche goes, cricket is a game full of glorious uncertainties.West IndiesThe visitors, West Indies, were dealt a major blow when Chris Gayle, known for playing wondrously exhilarating knocks in the shorter formats of the game, was laid low by a shoulder problem. To make it worse for the Windies, the trump card in their bowling line-up, Sunil Narine, was reported for 'illegal' bowling action twice in the just concluded CLT20 tournament. It meant that the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) withdrew Narine from the tour, and now he would look to rectify his action.West Indies though, still have enough fire-power to cause a few ripples in the Indian camp. Lendl Simmons, the nephew of former enigmatic West Indian batsman, Phil Simmons, can land hefty blows to clamber bowlers all over the park. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet sparkled at the international stage too many times. Marlon Samuels, the experienced campaigner, is gift-wrapped with a sizable portion of skill and talent. Yet, he is another of those batsmen from the West Indies, who can frustrate you by getting out to soft dismissals.The likes of Dwayne Smith, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell are handy cricketers in the sense that they can smash the opposition attack to shreds. All the players mentioned can also chip in with wickets with their medium pacers. Now, it is up to the highly skilled left-handed batsman, Darren Bravo and Denesh Ramdin to notch up big scores and anchor the innings.Unlike the Windies pacers of yore, Ravi Rampaul, Jason Holder and Kemar Roach won't make the batsmen shudder with fear with spine-chilling snorters. But they still have the ability to dent the Indian line-up with wickets upfront. Sulieman Benn, the slow left-arm orthodox and the one who replaced Narine, bowls with good control. It would also be interesting to see how Dwayne Bravo goes about captaining the side in tough conditions. He seems to have a calm head on his shoulders which should help his cause.IndiaWith the decks for ODIs in India turning out to be featherbeds, one can expect the hosts to make hay, as most of them like to play through the line of the ball. Shikhar Dhawan, who plays on the up and through the line in particular should enjoy the conditions on view. Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli are two batsmen, who on good batting tracks can send the crowd into a tizzy with their sizzling stroke-play. Both of them have the ability play those towering sixes that would continue to soar high and above into the stands. Ravindra Jadeja is a mettlesome all-rounder in this format.Of course, India have arguably the best finisher of all time in this format, Dhoni, to shore up the sinking ship and help his team to record one of those improbable victories that would go down into the folklore of Indian cricket as an awe-inspiring triumph.Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami are decent ODI bowlers. Bhuvneshwar is mainly a swing bowler, but over the years, has shown that on tracks with variable bounce, he can extract movement off the track as well. Shami can be inconsistent, but is good at bowling those yorkers in the end overs. Umesh Yadav has that extra pace up his sleeve, but may struggle to hold his own on featherbeds.Jadeja is expected to show his wares in Indian conditions. Dhoni the skipper, knows how to use his spinners well. He would like to test out Kuldeep Yadav, the left-arm chinaman bowler, who batsmen might find difficult to pick as he has not played much. Experienced leg-spinner, Amit Mishra is also in the mix.Pitch and conditionsHistorically, the track at Kochi is a batting paradise and should hold true for both the sides. The humidity factor though, sometimes comes into play and as a result, the team that wins the toss may bat first. If we jog our memory back to the first game played at this ground between Australia and India in 1998, it was crystal clear that Australians looked dead tired after being in the field for three and half hours and lost the game despite Adam Gilchrist and Mark Waugh giving them a rousing start.However, ever since ODIs have been played at Kochi, the team batting second too have won games. In fact, the last time West Indies played at the ground, they won the game by six wickets. Unfortunately, there is a chance of thunderstorms playing spoilsport, as heavy rain is expected.QuotesToday is the day when my parents have been rewarded for the number of sacrifices they made to make me a cricketer. I was disheartened and completely broken when the UP management didn't find me good enough to play Ranji Trophy. My parents and childhood coach consoled me a lot at that time. I started working harder and today, I am in the Indian team: Kuldeep Yadav, after he was picked in the Indian ODI squad.I believe that we have the players, who can go out there and perform, and play well enough to beat anybody. We accept that we are not at the top of the rankings, but the ability that we have, if we execute well, I believe we can do very well against India: Richie Richardson, who is the manager of the West Indies unit.Teams:West Indies (From): Dwayne Smith, Lendl Simmons, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy, Dwayne Bravo(c), Jason Holder, Ravi Rampaul, Sulieman Benn, Kemar Roach, Andre Russell, Jerome Taylor, Leon JohnsonIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni(c & w), Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Mohit Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav, Murali VijayLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
