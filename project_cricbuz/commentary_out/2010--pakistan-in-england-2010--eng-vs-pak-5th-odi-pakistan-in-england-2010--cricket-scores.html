Kamran Akmal is on strike. Tim Bresnan will open the attackThat was an excellent session of ODI cricket with a good tussle between bat and ball. England got off to a flier but Akhtar bowled a wonderful spell of fast bowling to get rid of the in-form Strauss and Trott. After a quiet middle session dominated by Pak spinners, Morgan and Collingwood forged a crucial partnership to take England to a safe position from where they could launch an assault on Pakistan in the late overs. But that was not to be, as Akhtar came back for his final spell and along with Gul picked up important wickets in the batting powerplay. England ended up scoring a defendable target of 256 thanks to Morgan's 4th ODI hundred. Can England defend this like Pak did the other night? Join us in 40 mins for the answer..4

Pakistan came back with a bang after being 2 down in the series. The bowling has been great for Pakistan as their bowlers have found some swing under the lights. We are all set for a thrilling finish to this series. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info.....By Vishaal LoganathanThe 3rd and 4th ODIs between England and Pakistan has shifted the focus firmly back on the cricket with Pakistan leveling the series with two outstanding wins. A short while ago, with the turmoil that Pakistan cricket was in, even the most ardent Pakistan fan would have feared a whitewash at the hands of the English, but Pakistan has defied millions by winning two games on the trot. The Pakistan team is now suddenly being looked upon as favourites to lift the trophy.Before the start, the series would have been seen upon by fans with not much anticipation and many would have expected a lop sided result. But the way the series has took off and gathered a good amount of curiosity about the winners has been superb. Pakistan have chosen to put all the controversy surrounding them behind them and let their game do the talking. The team management and Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi are worthy of the highest praise for inspiring their team to play well and win.Umar Gul has stood up to the task in the last two games, and his performance with the ball has been fantastic and key to their victories. Their captain, Shahid Afridi too has found some form ahead of the decider. Razzaq was awarded the Man of the Match for a fabulous performance in the last match that helped them seal a superb win and draw level in the series.Most of the Pakistani players have hit form at the right time and their captain will be delighted that he has many of his players firing ahead of the all important match. Fawad Alam, Asad Shafiq, Shoaib Akthar, Saeed Ajmal and Mohd Hafeez have all been performing well over the past two games.England had a superb start to the series with 2 rather convincing wins against Pakistan. Umar Gul's spell in the third match turned the match on its head and England ended on the losing side. Many would have thought of that loss as just a minor blip in their campaign. But after the loss at the hands of Pakistan again, not many would support the same view.Their opening partnership still looks rock solid with captain Andrew Strauss and Steve Davies forming a promising pair for England. Eoin Morgan too looks in good touch but will be unhappy at not being able to finish off the games. Anderson form with the ball has been outstanding in the series and fiery spells will be expected from the quickie.England look slight underdogs in the contest, but with home advantage and a team of superb players no one will put it beyond them to win the series. Pakistan have long been characterized by their unpredictability and that can again be a factor in the final match of the series. The series has set itself up brilliantly, and with a lot at stake for both teams, a scintillating contest is on the cards.Teams:England (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Steve Davies(w), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan, Michael Yardy, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Luke Wright, Ravi Bopara, Ajmal ShahzadPakistan (From): Kamran Akmal(w), Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Mohammad Yousuf, Fawad Alam, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Shahzaib Hasan, Azhar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad IrfanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
