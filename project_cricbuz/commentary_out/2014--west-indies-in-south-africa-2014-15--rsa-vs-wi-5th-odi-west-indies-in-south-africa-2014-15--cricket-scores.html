It was short and too far outside off, Gayle goes chasing after it and gets a feather through to QDK. The umpire called it a wide, but Amla challenged the decision and got it spot on. Gayle c de Kock b Kyle Abbott 0(1)Kyle Abbott to Gayle, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Straightaway South Africa are reviewing a caught behind appeal. Umpire Ravi calls it a wide. Abbott is fine with the front foot. There was some noice as ball passed bat. Even the Snicko picks up a spike. The decision has been overturned.Gayle and Deonarine are at the crease. Gayle is on strike. Kyle Abbott will open the attackWelcome back.. Amla has the South African players in a huddle. Gayle and Deonarine make their way out to the middle. Surprising not to see Smith at the top of the order. Abbott has the new ball. He has a couple of slips in place to assist him...The West Indies bowlers were very poor, that is putting it politely. Once Amla and Rossouw started going after them, they had no clue as to where to bowl. In the last 10 overs, they gave 146 runs and picked up only the 3 wickets. However, it is now upto their batsmen to come out and try chasing down this target. Join us back in a short while...Amla started off in a hurry as the West Indies bowlers bowled to his strength, he then settled down and paced his innings to perfection. The opener got to his 19th ODI ton and was only dismissed in the 41st over. Rossouw, on the other hand, took his time before unleashing himself, but once he was in, he raced past Amla to bring up his hundred. Miller and Duminy played cameos at the end to take the total past the 350-mark.Rain delayed the start of proceedings by two and a half hours, but that didn't dampen South Africa's spirits when they came out to bat. QDK didn't make much of an impact in his comeback game, even Faf failed to get going. However, the pair of Amla and Rossouw got together when the score was 59 and added yet another 247-run stand between them. They had amassed the same number of runs for the opening wicket at the Wanderers as well.4
SOUTH AFRICA:41.6 J Holder to Duminy, SIX, what a way to finish the innings! He didn't seem to have middled it, but the ball had enough fuel to carry all the way. Full delivery in the zone, Duminy gets underneath it and sends it into the night sky and over long-off

SOUTH AFRICA:41.1 J Holder to D Miller, SIX, lovely shot! It was superb timing from Miller. Full and outside off, Miller reaches for it and slices it with an open face. The timing on that takes it well over the ropeJason Holder [8.0-0-55-1] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:40.6 A Russell to Duminy, no run, a well directed yorker from Russell, Duminy moves away to the leg-side, fails to squeeze it away as he is hit on the back boot. The umpire didn't think that the ball would have hit the stumps, but the West Indies reviewed it and the Hawk-Eye showed that it was just clipping off-stumpWest Indies have reviewed an lbw decision. It is a legal delivery as Russell's foot is behind the line. There was no inside edge. Was it hitting the off-stump? The impact also might be a worry here. Umpire's call and the on-field call remains
SOUTH AFRICA:40.5 A Russell to Duminy, FOUR, Russell was unlucky there, bangs it in short and around off, Duminy goes for the pull and top-edges it over the keeper's head. South Africa will take those
SOUTH AFRICA:40.4 A Russell to Duminy, FOUR, the onslaught continues, slower delivery just outside off, Duminy gets his front leg out of the way and lofts it over mid-on. Even though he didn't middle it, he had enough wood to fetch him a four

SOUTH AFRICA:40.2 A Russell to Amla, out Bowled!! Another splendid innings from Amla comes to an end. Miller walks up and pats his team-mate on the back and so do some of the West Indian fielders. This is the first time in the series that a bowler has got Amla out. It was a slower one, the length was tad short, Amla looks to drag the pull to deep mid-wicket, but can only manage an inside edge onto the off-stump. Amla b A Russell 133(105) [4s-11 6s-6]A Russell to Amla, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

SOUTH AFRICA:38.4 A Russell to Rossouw, out Caught by J Carter!! Finally, West Indies have managed to get one of them out. Rossouw goes back to a standing ovation. Everyone present at the Centurion are up on their feet. It was an off-speed delivery around off, Rossouw is deceived by the lack of pace as he tries to heave it to cow corner, can't generate the pace and offers a simple catch to deep mid-wicket. Rossouw c J Carter b A Russell 132(98) [4s-9 6s-8]A Russell to Rossouw, THATS OUT!! Caught!!This is now the highest third wicket stand for South Africa against any team. The duo had also added 247 runs for the first wicket at the Wanderers.
SOUTH AFRICA:38.3 A Russell to Amla, 1 run, too straight, on middle and leg, Amla helps it on the way to short fine leg. Either side of the fielder and that would have been another four

SOUTH AFRICA:38.1 A Russell to Amla, FOUR, nice juicy full delivery, Amla says thank you very much, moves across his stumps and hammers it on the bounce to the long-off fence. None of the fielder bothered to moveAndre Russell [6.0-0-60-1] is back into the attack

SOUTH AFRICA:36.2 J Holder to Rossouw, SIX, rubbish delivery from Holder, delivers a friendly full toss outside off, Rossouw walks across his stumps and flat-bats it over long-on. For a second, he might have thought he mishit that, but it cleared the rope comfortably

Also, Quinton de Kock will return to the side, after recovering from an ankle injury.Although South Africa would not be too worried about the way things unfolded, but a defeat just before the World Cup is not something they would want. On the other hand, now that West Indies have finally been able to lift their spirits, they would love to finish the series on a high. South Africa will be looking to bring back their rested players, while the visitors would ideally stick to the winning combination. Hello and welcome to the final ODI being played at the Centurion. We will bring you the toss and team updates in a while. Stay tuned..After receiving a thorough drubbing in the first three games of the series, West Indies stunned the hosts with a one wicket victory in the previous ODI. Batting first, a vastly depleted South African team posted a competitive 262 on board after struggling on 76/4 at one point. David Miller went on to score his first ODI ton. However, the Caribbean team kept their cool, thanks to a brilliant innings by Andre Russell and chased down the target with nine balls to spare.Preview:West Indies would like to register their second successive ODI win in the fifth and final match against favourites South Africa at Centurion on Wednesday to feel good about their chances at the ICC Cricket World Cup which begins a little over two weeks from now.South Africa were clinical in the first three games and were on course to inflict another loss on West Indies at Port Elizabeth on Sunday when they had reduced them to 73 for 5. Fuelled by David Miller's maiden ton, the hosts had posted 262 to challenge the Caribbean team but Marlon Samuels and Darren Sammy added 93 before allrounder Andre Russell scored 64 not out off 40 balls to stun the Proteas with nine deliveries and a wicket in hand.South Africa captain AB de Villiers played down the defeat by saying it was not a wake-up call. "We weren't complacent or anything like that. It's a painful affair, but we move on and we will try to finish on a high in Centurion," he said. But such a defeat ahead of such an important tournament was not ideal for South Africa.It wasn't the first time the hosts were taken aback on the tour. Not long ago, in the second T20I at Johannesburg, they failed to defend a mammoth 231 for 7 after the onslaught of Chris Gayle who made a 41-ball 90.West Indies, on the contrary, would take a lot of heart from the Port Elizabeth win and another victory could push the disappointments of the first three ODIs to the background. If Russell can keep performing like that, West Indies may not feel the absence of Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard, controversially left out of the World Cup squad.On the back of such a thumping win, the Caribbean team is unlikely to make any changes to its team but South Africa might want to bring back the experienced quartet of Hashim Amla, Imran Tahir, Vernon Philander and Dale Steyn, all of whom were rested for the Port Elizabeth game.Teams:West Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Leon Johnson, Marlon Samuels, Jonathan Carter, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Carlos Brathwaite, Sheldon Cottrell, Lendl Simmons, Narsingh Deonarine, Jerome Taylor, Sulieman BennSouth Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla(c), Rilee Rossouw, Faf du Plessis, David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Vernon Philander, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Phangiso, Morne Morkel, Kyle Abbott, Imran Tahir, Morne van Wyk, Dale SteynLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
