This is also the highest score on this ground.Lasith Malinga ended up with figures of 10-0-85-0. There are his 2nd most expensive figures (in terms of runs) in ODIs. His most expensive figures remain 7.2-0-96-0 against India in Hobart.Stats: de Kock made his 5th ODI century today. de Kock has the most number of centuries for a batsman at the age of 21.Carnage at Hambantota and South Africa have helped themselves to a massive 339. Quinton de Kock made a fine 128, his 5th ODI ton. He put on 118 for the first wicket with Hashim Amla (48) but SL fought back through Herath. The left armer dismissed Amla and the out-of-touch Jacques Kallis (4) in quick succession but that only brought in AB de Villiers. He had a couple of promising starts in this series, but AB brought the best out of him today as he smashed a 66-ball hundred. He was well assisted by de Kock and Duminy as SA rattled along. All the bowlers barring Herath were expensive and it has left SL with a mountain to climb. Will SA defend this total and record their first ODI series win in SL? Join us in a while to find out..4

Malinga to open for Sri Lanka.AB says Vernon Philander isn't feeling well and that is the reason he has been replaced by Wayne Parnell.Pitch Report: "The pitch is bone dry and there are a few cracks on the surface. The pitch will grip a bit and there should be reverse swing on offer. The team winning the toss will opt to bat first."Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Rangana HerathSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirOne change for both teams. Sri Lanka have strengthened their spin department as they have brought in Rangana Herath for Nuwan Kulasekara. Steyn has passed fit but South Africa have left out Vernon Philander with Wayne Parnell playing in his place.South Africa have won the toss and have opted to batHello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the final ODI between Sri Lanka and South Africa from Hambantota. The series is level at 1-1 with SA winning the first ODI before the hosts pulled back to even terms in the second encounter. Toss and team updates in a while..Preview by PradeepAngelo Mathews heaved a sigh of relief after Sri Lanka managed to win the second ODI by 87 runs. While a second successive loss would have dented Sri Lanka's impeccable 2014 record, Mathews would have also been the first Sri Lanka captain to lose an ODI series at home against South Africa. With the series now all square at 1-1, the two teams are off to Hambantota for the decider. Having learnt lessons from the first ODI, where bad light threatened to disrupt the day match, both teams have agreed to use the floodlights if required. AB de Villiers and his team are on the threshold of creating history, but for that to happen they need a consistent performance from the entire team.Sri Lanka:The hosts' batting has yielded mixed returns in the first two matches. While it was Kumar Sangakkara who steadied the ship in the first match, it was the turn of Tillakaratne Dilshan at Pallekele, by his own admission, his favourite ground. But unlike at the R Premadasa stadium, the opener had some support in the form of Mahela Jayawardene, who made a scratchy but vital 48. Ashan Priyanjan was impressive in his brief knock, but the team management will be worried about the lack of runs from the lower order.While the batting looks strong, the bowling looks healthy with the number of spin options that Mathews can call upon. Dilshan, Ajantha Mendis and Sachithra Senanayake spun a web around the South African batsmen at Pallekele. Except, Hashim Amla and to an extent, AB de Villiers, none of the other batsmen could master the spinners who were at home on a dry pitch. Lasith Malinga, who had an off-day in the 1st ODI, showed glimpses of his glorious past as the hosts cruised homeSouth Africa:Hashim Amla has been the story of South Africa's batting. Two hundreds in two matches and he is perhaps the only batsmen who has looked largely untroubled by the Sri Lankan bowlers. Support though hasn't been coming for the right-hander. Quinton de Kock failed to convert his start in the first match while Jacques Kallis is struggling for touch since his return to the ODI format. Skipper, AB de Villiers has shown a tendency of wasting starts while the middle and lower order struggled to cope up with Sri Lanka's spinners. With similar conditions expected at Hambantota, they will have to pull up their sock if they are to compete.The bowling has shone in patches but as skipper, de Villiers noted, it hasn't been consistent enough. Steyn walked away after sustaining a thumb injury during the second ODI, and is a doubtful starter at Hambantota. Vernon Philander's pace hardly troubled the Sri Lankans but Morne Morkel and leg-spinner, Imran Tahir have been excellent. JP Duminy provides depth, and in sub-continental conditions can qualify as more than just a part-time option.Team News:With the series on line, Sri Lanka may not make too many major changes. However, they will be concerned with the form of Nuwan Kulasekara, who has been disappointing so far, and the hosts might look at bringing in Rangana Herath or Suranga Lakmal in his place. Off-spinner, Dilruwan Perera has been called up as cover for Sachithra Senanayake, who is awaiting the result after being called for chucking during the England ODI series.As far as South Africa are concerned, Dale Steyn is a doubtful starter after sustaining a thumb injury during the second ODI. He had a precautionary X-Ray done and didn't seem to be in any pain during his batting stint. If he is ruled out, Wayne Parnell might be his most likely replacement.Quotes:It's never nice to win one and then lose one ? you look like an inconsistent team: AB de Villiers wants more consistency from his team.We showed lot of character especially after the defeat, it was hard to come back: Angelo Mathews was pleased with the fightback.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Faf du Plessis, Beuran Hendricks, Wayne Parnell, Aaron PhangisoSri Lanka (From): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Rangana Herath, Suranga Lakmal, Thisara Perera, Kithuruwan Vithanage, Dilruwan PereraLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
