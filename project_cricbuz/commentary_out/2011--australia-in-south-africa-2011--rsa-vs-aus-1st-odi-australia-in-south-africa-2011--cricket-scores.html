SOUTH AFRICA:0.1  Bollinger to Graeme Smith, no run, fuller length delivery outside off and swinging away from Smith who lets it go to the keeperGraeme Smith and Amla are at the crease. Graeme Smith is on strike. Bollinger will open the attackBotha seemed surprised when he was told that the target might be as high as 223. So will most South Africans. They don't share that good a relationship with Duckworth and Lewis. Bollinger to start proceedings for AustraliaAs I speculated earlier, the target for the South Africans will be 223 runs in 29 overs.Australia will consider themselves unlucky. Clarke and Ponting had consolidated really well after the early exit of Warner. They both were looking set for big scores. But hide and seek from the rain ensured that the match was curtailed to 29 overs a side. The two veterans came out trying to score at a frenetic pace and Clarke seemed to have adjusted and got a couple of big hits away, but was soon run out. Ponting looked totally out of place and returned back to the hut after scoring his 82nd ODI fifty. Hussey looked in good touch and thanks to his cameo, Australia have gotten up to a good score. It will surely be altered a bit for South Africa. They might have to chase around 220 in their quota of 29 overs. Stay tuned for the Protea chase. It should be a good one.Botha: It will be an interesting chase. The outfield is a bit slippery and the ball is skidding onto the bat. I don't think we might make any change in the batting order. The guys coming in are more than capable. Two new balls might make it challenging2

Steyn will open the attackWe are all set to start, full crowd in there and Steyn will open the attack. Ponting will open the innings with Warner. When was the last time we saw that?Teams:Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke(c), Michael Hussey, Steven Smith, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Johnson, Xavier Doherty, Doug Bollinger, Pat CumminsSouth Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla(c), Jacques Kallis, Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, David Miller, Mark Boucher(w), Johan Botha, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo TsotsobeClarke: Pat Cummins will make his debut. Watson and Marsh are out injured. It's good to have Warner at the top. It was nice to get a test and ODI series win in Sri Lanka. Hope that this tour goes off well. We are looking forward to the new regulations.Amla: The experience of Kallis will come in handy. Hopefully we can manage the change from T20 to ODIs well. Too early to predict what will be the effect of the new rulesSouth Africa have won the toss and elected to fieldSouth African captain Hashim Amla has won the toss and elected to field first. As we get ready for the toss, a little birdie informs us that Mitchell Marsh and Patrick Cummins might make their ODI debuts today. Shane Watson and Shaun Marsh were reported to be carrying some injuries. So who will open the innings for Australia with Warner? Will it be Ponting? Or Mike Hussey? We shall know in a short whileHello and welcome to the first ODI between South Africa and Australia at Centurion, South Africa. Both the teams are evenly matched, proof of which was given by the 1-1 standing of the 2 match T20 series, and whoever wins this first match will surely gain an upper hand psychologically. We will bring you the toss in a short while.Preview by Saurabh SomaniSouth Africa and Australia have always provided sharp-edged contests over the years, and their recently concluded Twenty20 series was a fine example of that, with the spoils being shared 1-1. The ODI series that is about to get underway is not likely to be any different. Both teams have traditionally always been amongst the stronger ones in world cricket, and both have the distinction of playing two of the most memorable ODI matches of all time - the tied semi-final in the 1999 World Cup and the match that's called "the 434 game". While the current ODI series may not produce such matches, it is more or less certain that it won't produce dull cricket.South Africa: The hosts wear a considerably altered look from the side that took to the field for the Twenty20 matches. Returning to the squad are the rested Jacques Kallis and Dale Steyn - each man well capable of winning a match on his own. Where South Africa might be lacking is in the top-order batting. Without the giant presence of AB de Villiers, it wears a thinner than normal look, especially given the poor form that Graeme Smith has been experiencing. The burden of scoring is going to rest on Hashim Amla, Kallis and JP Duminy in all likelihood. The bowling appears considerably stronger. Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel will lead the attack and South Africa have the luxury of choosing either Lonwabo Tsotsobe or Wayne Parnell as the third seamer. There are a host of spinners with Imran Tahir, Johan Botha and Robin Peterson - and Botha's batting ability could swing the selection his way. If the hosts want to gamble, they can include the impressive Tahir too and see how Australia handle quality spin.Australia: One of Australia's biggest worries ahead of the match is the fitness of Shane Watson. With his top-order batting and seam-up bowling, Watson's presence lends an incredible balance to the team, but he had to sit out of the second T20 with a niggle and it's not yet certain that he will recover for the first ODI. The man who replaced him - Mitchell Marsh - did a very good job though, and Watson's absence will be another opportunity for the junior Marsh to strut his stuff. Like South Africa, Australia too sport a new look from the T20s, with seniors Michael Clarke and Ricky Ponting being the most prominent faces returning. Again like the hosts, the visitors are also missing a key player in Brett Lee. In Lee's absence, the bowling will be led by Mitchell Johnson and Doug Bollinger and it remains to be seen if the young and undeniably quick Pat Cummins is gambled on. Australia have Xavier Doherty and Steve Smith to choose from as their spinning option.Captain vs Captain:Hashim Amla: His current role may be that of a stand-in captain, but it is as a batsman that Amla has really shone. Thought to be not fit for ODIs once upon a time, this will be his 50th ODI match. His statistics in the format are jaw-dropping: an average of over 57 and a strike-rate of almost 93. With a great deal of the batting burden on him, the captaincy, and a mini-landmark of the 50th ODI to boot, the spotlight is squarely on the soft-spoken South African.Michael Clarke: Since assuming the Australian captaincy full-time, Michael Clarke has scored his runs at an average of 97.50. The catch, of course, is that it's been only 8 matches and 7 innings, but it does point to his recent good form. Captaincy doesn't appear to have weighed him down, though the current series will be a tougher test than any other he has faced so far. However, Clarke has seemed to enjoy the captaincy so far, and the responsibility has made him more hungry for runs.
