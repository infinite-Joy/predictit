India would probably want to take confidence from the fact that they have never lost an ODI at this venue. On the other hand, the pitch isn't that difficult to bat on and South Africa should fancy their chances. Let's hope that we have a very good second half.Rahane: "I really enjoyed batting here. The wicket was spongy, so I took my time and played my shots. I am enjoying batting up the order, but it's a team sport, so I am happy to do whatever the team wants. The wicket is slightly slow, it wasn't turning a lot, we were looking score around 260. I think we've got a decent total. We need to bowl well now, the first 10 overs will be crucial."It was a fine bowling performance from South Africa. There was a bit of help from the wicket and they hit the right areas. All their strike bowlers were among the wickets, with Steyn being the pick with 3/49. The target doesn't look daunting and they should feel they have the chance to go 2-0 up in the series. Join us in a short while for the run chase...Rahane continued and composed a fifty, his third consecutive fifty against South Africa. But he was bowled round the legs after reaching the landmark. Raina was undone by the short ball strategy. Dhoni was running out of partners at the other end, but Harbhajan stuck it out to add 56 runs for 8th wicket. Dhoni farmed the strike when just one wicket was left in the tank. He made sure that India batted the 50 overs and also took them to a respectable total.If not for Dhoni, the final total would have been much worse for India. The captain has answered his critics with this knock. The hosts opted to bat on a wicket that was flat. The in-form batsman Rohit Sharma was castled in the very second over. Dhawan and Rahane saw that no further wickets were lost in the first 10 overs. However, Dhawan fell once again after getting a start. A mix-up between Rahane and Kohli brought about the downfall of the latter.It was another top last over from Rabada.

INDIA:23.4 M Morkel to Raina, out Caught by de Kock!! This is ugly cricket from Suresh Raina, surely he's got to find a way to tackle the short ball. The umpire has asked him to wait to check the no-ball. That looks tight, but looks like Morne has got just something behind the line. Raina has to go. This was banged in short around leg stump line, Raina was never comfortable to that line and even played and missed on a couple of occasions earlier in the over. This time he hops, tries to glance and gets a glove, the keeper dives forward and takes an easy catch. Umpire Aleem Dar didn't take long to put the finger up. So it's a 5-ball duck for Raina.

INDIA:22.4 Tahir to Rahane, out Bowled!! This is a classical leg-spinner's dismissal. Rahane can't believe that he's been bowled round his legs. He asked the umpires and they sent it upstairs to check if it came off the keeper, but the side angle quite clearly showed that the ball clipped the leg stump. Flighted delivery pitching outside leg, Rahane was slightly across his stumps as he was down on his knee to paddle-sweep, the ball hit the rough patch near the crease and turns, sneaks past the bat and the pad to hit the leg stump. India are in deep trouble at 102/4. Rahane b Tahir 51(63) [4s-6]Tahir to Rahane, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Third umpire has been called to check if Rahane has been bowled.

Morne bangs this short, Rahane spots it early, transfers his weight back and just ramps it over the keeper's head for a boundary. Rahane raises his bat to the crowd and the dressing room

South Africa are in the middle of a team huddle and out come the two Indian batsmen.It was always expected to be a tough home series, but no one would have expected India to remain winless going into the fifth match of the tour. They have never lost on this ground, will this be the start of India's revival?Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Kagiso Rabada, Imran TahirIndia (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni(w/c), Suresh Raina, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Umesh YadavAB de Villiers: "We are also looking to bat first. Looking at our bowlers warming-up, there is a bit of swing in the air, so hopefully we'll start really well with the ball and restrict them to a chasable total. We are playing an unchanged side. We always want to improve. Yes, we won the last game, but still can play better. Not a lot teams have come here and won the first three games of the tour, hopefully we can win today as well."MS Dhoni: "We will bat first. Looks like a good wicket, it's a bit hot, we are told that dew comes only after 8.30. Binny, Mishra and Ashwin (injured) are out, Axar, Mohit and Harbhajan are in. It was tough to leave out Mishra, because he was our best pick in the last game, but at the same time I can't see him bat at No. 7 because that will make out batting light. Looking at the composition, we had to make these changes. Spinners have been our strength. The fast bowlers were quite after from the last few overs, hopefully they will come good today. We felt that it's good to have three proper fast bowlers at this venue, Raina can bowl a bit of off-spin as well. We are confident of doing well today."India have won the toss and have opted to batToss time folks!Moving on, India will be forced to make a change after R Ashwin picked up an injury during the first ODI. Harbhajan Singh has been added to the squad and it will be interesting to see if Dhoni includes him straightaway into the playing XI. India also have the option of using Gurkeerat Singh Mann, who bowls off-spin and has the ability to score quickly down the order. Since the side is looking for a finisher, maybe Dhoni might be thinking to have a look at Gurkeerat. But, is he ready to replace a frontline bowler with a batting all-rounder? Will Stuart Binny get another game? On the other hand, South Africa are not expected to make any changes. We'll wait and watch though. More team news from the toss, which is not too far away.It is nice and sunny out there and the players are warming up on the outfield. The stands are fast filling and the ground is already more than half full with about 20 minutes to go for the toss. People are wondering if MS Dhoni has lost his touch. With Dhoni being unable to finish the game a couple of days ago despite being very familiar with the situation, a lot of them started doubting his skills, but personally I feel that he's too good a player to not bounce back. Let's give time some time and see how things pan out.There have been just three ODIs played at this venue and all have been high-scoring encounters. With the boundaries being short, batsmen playing more aggressively nowadays and with the quality players on both sides, it won't be surprising to see a mammoth score being posted on the board. This is what Rohit said after having a look at the 22 yards: The pitch looks good. There have been high scores. Virender Sehwag scored his double ton here so we know what needs to be done. Whether dew will play a part or not is not clear yet.Two of Rohit Sharma's hundreds (106 in Dharamsala, 150 in Kanpur) have already gone in vain in this series and the opener wants his bowlers to deliver quality goods. "It (the bowling) is a concern, we cannot run away from that. When you're bowling to players like AB de Villiers, you have to be extra-smart and more pro-active. All the fast bowlers are working on it. I feel they just need to be more pro-active, that will help us," Rohit Sharma said, ahead of the second ODI.The last time India played a game at the Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore, a bludgeoning opener was unstoppable. On December 8, 2011, Virender Sehwag smashed West Indies' bowlers to all corners to become the second player to score a double-hundred in ODIs. His 219 was also the highest individual score back then. So what do we have in store today? Hello and a warm welcome to the second game of the 5-match ODI series. Just like the T20I series, the ODI series too was off to a cracking start, with Kagiso Rabada's calmness helping South Africa clinch a thriller by 5 runs.Preview:South Africa have had a splendid start to their tour of India, winning three out of the four games that has taken place so far. India lost a close match in Kanpur but will take heart from the fact that they managed to fight till the end. While the scoreline suggests a disparity in quality between the teams, a closer look will indicate that India have failed to come up trumps in crunch situations. Both teams will be aware of that fact. South Africa need to ride the momentum to put more pressure on the hosts while MS Dhoni and Co. will be gunning to turn things around quickly.The last time India played in Indore, Virender Sehwag smashed a double ton. If the pitch is anywhere similar to how it was four years ago, then another run-feast is on the cards with both sides packing some explosive batsmen. The recent ODI rule changes, however, are aimed at restricting the boundaries scored in the death overs but South Africa still managed to amass 86 in the last six overs of their innings in Kanpur. However, that was as much a result of poor bowling from India and exceptional hitting by AB de Villiers in particular.Date: 14th October, 2015Time: 13:30 Local timeVenue: Holkar stadium, IndoreIndiaR Ashwin's injury came as a big blow midway through the first game. The absence of the in-form spinner will continue to hamper Dhoni's plans, robbing him of a genuine wicket-taker in these conditions. Harbhajan Singh's inclusion is aimed at stemming the difference and India will also be toying with the idea of playing three spinners. Axar Patel should be a straight swap for Stuart Binny while the pacers are expected to hold on to their spots.India's batting order too warrants a reshuffle with suggestions from various quarters calling for Virat Kohli to return to the No. 3 spot. However, that would entail dropping Ajinkya Rahane who scored a valauble fifty in the previous game. Given that they fell just five short in the previous game, India are likely to give the combination a longer rope.Probable XI: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni, Axar Patel/Stuart Binny, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Umesh YadavSouth AfricaMost things went right for South Africa in the first ODI. All their batsmen got off to starts while AB de Villiers converted it into something special. David Miller's form will be a cause of concern but not something that will give the team management sleepless nights. They can still afford to go in with an unchanged combination.However, an area of concern will be the bowling unit getting used to the conditions better. India were on song in the chase for a large part of the innings and on a rather helpful wicket, South Africa were not able to restrict runs against Rohit Sharma and Rahane in particular.Probable XI: Quinton de Kock, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirQuotes:The number three, four and five are very crucial positions in any format.
