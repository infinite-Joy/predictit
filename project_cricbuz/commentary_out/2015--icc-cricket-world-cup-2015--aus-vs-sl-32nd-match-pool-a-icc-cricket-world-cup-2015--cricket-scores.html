SRI LANKA:44.3 Starc to S Prasanna, out Bowled!! This was coming. You have to get behind the line when Starc is swinging it away from you from round the wicket. Instead, Prasanna goes leg-side and exposes all the sticks, Starc bowls that perfect yorker once again and hits the base of off stump. S Prasanna b Starc 9(11) [4s-1]Starc to S Prasanna, THATS OUT!!

SRI LANKA:42.2 Johnson to T Perera, out Caught by Doherty!! "Ohhhhhh," says Perera as soon as he hits that and he knows he is in trouble. Johnson bowls a short slower ball around the leg stump line, Perera tries to pull, but doesn't pick the change of pace, goes through with the shot and mistimes it completely. In fact, he loses his bottom hand grip while playing the shot. Long-on comes forward and to his left and holds onto a good catch. Surely, it's advantage Australia now. T Perera c Doherty b Johnson 8(3) [4s-2]Johnson to T Perera, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

SRI LANKA:41.3 Watson to Mathews, out Caught by Haddin!! Shane Watson is absolutely pumped. "Yessss, come on," says Watto as he pumps his fist. This is a body blow for Sri Lanka. Good surprise short ball from Watson, Mathews tries to hook but gets a thin edge through to the keeper. That Mathews-Chandimal stand was doing it for Sri Lanka, but suddenly, the injury to Chandimal has changed the complexion of the match. Credit to Clarke for continuing with Watson, despite him being very expensive. Mathews c Haddin b Watson 35(31) [4s-2 6s-1]Watson to Mathews, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:41.2 Watson to Mathews, 2 runs, bowls a yorker, Mathews flicks it wide of long-on and races back for the secondMathews asks Chandimal to retire hurt and he's going off. Chandimal has retired hurt because he couldn't run. This is so unfortunate for Sri Lanka. Thisara Perera walks in.
SRI LANKA:41.1 Watson to Chandimal, 1 run, round the wicket, low full toss, Chandimal flicks it to fine legThis is unfortunate for Sri Lanka. Chandimal was batting so well and suddenly he's hardly able to move. This could make a difference
SRI LANKA:40.6 Johnson to Mathews, 2 runs, short of length delivery just outside off stump, Mathews pulls it wide of mid-on, Starc runs back and just manages to pull it back in time before touching the rope. Because Chandimal is struggling with his hamstring, Sri Lanka could not get three
SRI LANKA:40.5 Johnson to Chandimal, 1 run, short and on the stumps, Chandimal pulls it to deep backward square leg, Chandimal is clearly struggling
SRI LANKA:40.4 Johnson to Chandimal, 2 runs, short of a length delivery just outside off stump, Chandimal pulls and gets a fat top edge, Clarke, who was at square leg realises very late that it was his catch and the ball clears him quite easily. 13th ODI fifty for Chandimal. Oops! he's not able to move freely, he is limpingLooks like Chandimal is suffering from cramps. The physio comes out to attend to him. Slight break in play. He takes a tablet. Something is wrong in his right hamstring. He's ready now!
SRI LANKA:40.3 Johnson to Chandimal, 2 runs, short ball on the leg stump, Chandimal pulls well, but the man at deep mid-wicket runs swiftly to his right and saves two

SRI LANKA:40.1 Johnson to Mathews, no run, slower ball angling away from the right-hander, Mathews swings and missesSri Lanka have scored 64 runs in the last 5 overs. 105 in 60 balls is doable.

SRI LANKA:39.1 Watson to Mathews, 1 run, back of a length from Watson, Mathews mistimes it to mid-wicketComing back to the Sangakkara wicket. Just like how Malinga got away with a close no-ball call when he dismissed Clarke, Faulkner gets away with a tight call for a no-ball. The directive to the third umpire for this tournament is, if there is no conclusive evidence that a bowler has overstepped, the benefit of the doubt will go to the bowler.Shane Watson [4.0-0-40-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:38.6 Johnson to Chandimal, FOUR, slower ball and width on offer, Chandimal goes off-side a bit, he was cramped for room a touch but he manages to time the cut shot really well and sent it to the right of backward point

SRI LANKA:38.3 Johnson to Chandimal, 2 runs, in the air and just wide of Starc at mid-on.

SRI LANKA:38.1 Johnson to Mathews, FOUR, short of length delivery outside off stump, Mathews rocks back and cuts it fiercely to the deep backward point boundary. Not the ideal start to a new spell from JohnsonMitchell Johnson [6.0-0-38-1] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:37.5 Faulkner to Chandimal, 1 run, biggg mix-up, but all is well for Chandimal in the end. Slower delivery outside off stump, Chandimal pushes it to extra-cover, hesitates after taking off initially, the throw comes in from Clarke to the bowler's end, Faulkner thinks it would hit the stumps directly and lets it go, but on seeing the ball miss the stumps, he tries to run him about after grabbing the rebound but by then, Chandimal was well in

SRI LANKA:36.5 Doherty to Chandimal, FOUR, excellent placement again from Chandimal. Doherty follows Chandimal as he steps out and goes leg-side, Chandimal plays a lovely on-drive and mid-on was way too square to come into the picture

SRI LANKA:36.3 Doherty to Mathews, no run, full toss, flicked straight to mid-wicket

SRI LANKA:35.1 Watson to Chandimal, FOUR, slower ball outside off stump, Chandimal lofts wide of the man at mid-off and picks up four. That wasn't convincing from ChandimalShane Watson [3.0-0-24-0] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:33.5 Faulkner to Sangakkara, out Caught by Finch!! The slower ball does the trick. It's the batting powerplay again that helps the bowling side take wickets. Oh no! Is it a no-ball? It's a tough call. Looks like it's on the line, but the umpire reckons there was just something behind the line. It's a very tough call and a brave call by the third umpire. Looked like the heel landed on the line, but since there was no clear evidence, the benefit of the doubt went to the bowler. Slower delivery outside off stump, Sangakkara goes for the loft after coming down the track, but slices it, in fact the ball hit the toe-end of the bat, the man at deep cover rushes in and takes a good catch. End of a fantastic knock from Sanga! Australia have the upper hand now. Sangakkara c Finch b Faulkner 104(107) [4s-11]Faulkner to Sangakkara, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

SRI LANKA:32.1 Starc to Mathews, 1 run, pushes the length ball straight down the ground and sets offStarc now has a slip. Good captaincy from Clarke.For Sri Lanka to win the match, Sangakkara needs to bat for about 40 overs and others have to give him support. The problem for Sri Lanka is that due to Glenn Maxwell's thunderous knock, Australia were able to score 123 runs in the last 10 overs. It is going to be tough for Sri Lanka to match that.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 15 overs: James Faulkner, with his slew of variations and by mixing up the lengths bowled a few tight overs. He was rewarded with the wicket of Tillakaratne Dilshan. Dilshan challenged that LBW decision, but it was rightly upheld. On what looks more like a subcontinental track, Australian pacers tried to hit Sri Lanka with pace upfront. But Faulkner has certainly adjusted to the conditions well. Kumar Sangakkara though, continued to flatten the Australian attack and smashed another century in this World Cup. He is now the seventh batsman to compose three back-to-back hundreds in ODIs. He is also the first player to do that in the history of World Cups. However, Michael Clarke effected a direct hit to run out Mahela Jayawardene. Drinks are on the field nowThis is the 4th consecutive time in ODIs that Sangakkara has not missed out on a hundred after reaching fifty.

SRI LANKA:31.2 Faulkner to Sangakkara, 2 runs, 24th ODI hundred for Sangakkara and he's the first man on the planet to score three consecutive hundreds in World Cups. Full and down the leg-side, Sangakkara flicks it along the ground to deep square leg and gets back for the second. He gets a great round of applause from the crowd. Everyone at the SCG stand and applaud. No great celebrations from the legend though. Just takes the helmet off and raises the bat
SRI LANKA:31.1 Faulkner to Mathews, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Mathews dabs it to third manAngelo Mathews, right handed bat, comes to the creaseI think this is going to be interesting. Starc is getting the ball to reverse and he will be very difficult to handle. Sri Lanka will have to be careful against him.
SRI LANKA:30.6 Starc to M Jayawardene, out M Jayawardene Run Out!! Starc built the pressure with some lovely reverse-swinging balls and Jayawardene has fallen into the trap trying to steal a run. Needless from the senior pro! Full and outside off stump, Jayawardene pushes it straight to mid-off and takes off, Clarke quickly grabs the ball and fires a direct-hit and catches Jayawardene short despite a full length dive. M Jayawardene run out (Clarke) 19(22) [4s-1]Starc to M Jayawardene, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!What have you done Mahela Jayawardene! I think he's run-out. YES! He's OUT! Brilliant piece of fielding from the Australian skipper.

SRI LANKA:30.4 Starc to Sangakkara, 1 run, wow! Brilliant inswinging toe-crusher from Starc. Interestingly, Starc appeals for LBW, but there was a big inside edge. Sangakkara was completely surprised by the late inswing, somehow he managed to get an inside edge onto the back leg and it rolled to square leg
SRI LANKA:30.3 Starc to Sangakkara, no run, full and outside off stump, driven back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:30.2 Starc to Sangakkara, no run, what a ball! Not easy to beat a bloke batting on 98. Full and just outside off stump, it started to tail back in and then held its line after pitching, Sangakkara hardly moved his feet attempting a drive and it almost took the outside edge
SRI LANKA:30.1 Starc to M Jayawardene, 1 run, short of length delivery down the leg-side, glanced to fine legMitchell Starc [5.0-0-16-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:29.6 Faulkner to Sangakkara, FOUR, a hat-trick of boundaries for Sanga! Poor ball from Faulkner again. Short and well outside off stump, asking for trouble and Sangakkara cuts it over point and it runs away to the boundary. Great start to the batting powerplay for Sri Lanka. They have scored 17 runs off the first 6 balls
SRI LANKA:29.5 Faulkner to Sangakkara, FOUR, four more! Faulkner gets the slower ball wrong. Bowls this down the leg-side and Sangakkara tickles it on its way. Moves onto 94 now

SRI LANKA:29.3 Faulkner to Sangakkara, 2 runs, in the airrrr and Maxwell doesn't get there. Great effort though!

SRI LANKA:29.2 Faulkner to M Jayawardene, 1 run, slower ball down the leg-side, Jayawardene glances it to backward square leg
SRI LANKA:29.1 Faulkner to M Jayawardene, 2 runs, slower ball on the stumps, Jayawardene flicks it along the ground to deep backward square legJames Faulkner [4.0-0-15-1] is back into the attackThird man is in, fine leg is back.Wow! Sri Lanka have taken the batting powerplay early.

SRI LANKA:27.2 Maxwell to M Jayawardene, no run, half-shout for LBW, not given. Nicely tossed up from Maxwell, Jayawardene goes early into the sweep and misses. Maybe it hit Jayawardene outside the line of off stump

SRI LANKA:17.1 Faulkner to Dilshan, no run, short of a length and just outside off, Dilshan arches back and dabs it straight to the fielder at backward pointJames Faulkner, comes into the attackTillakaratne Dilshan too looked to use the pace of Australian bowlers as he played a volley of thunderous strokes off Johnson's bowling by smashing him for six boundaries in a single over! In particular, the pull shot he played in that over seemed to have crashed into the boundary boards at the speed of light. Dilshan didn't stop there as he used the scoop to collect a four off Mitchell Starc. It was a thrill-a-minute stuff at the SCG. Sri Lanka have a long way to go, but Dilshan and Sangakkara have given them a great platform. In fact, the story could have been different as Michael Clarke dropped a tough chance to give Dilshan a reprieve. On the other hand, Australia looked to bowl cross-seam. The outfield is lightning quick and that makes it harder for the fielding side. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: Mitchell Johnson gave Australia the perfect start by bowling a vicious lifter to take the wicket of Lahiru Thirimanne. Initially, he also troubled Kumar Sangakkara with his slingy left-armer's angle. Sangakkara, generally, looked to play straight before he took on Johnson with a pull shot. Sangakkara was late on the pull shot, but fortunately for him, he collected four runs."Things have changed so much! Even the Ladies and Members Stands join in the Mexican Wave doing the rounds of SCG," says G Rajaraman from the ground.Drinks are on the field now

Thirimanne is on strike. Starc will open the attackWelcome back..Sri Lanka's batsmen have fired so far in the tournament. But can they chase down 377 against Johnson, Starc and Co?@bhogleharsha: The ground looks like it could be Colombo, the pitch seemed slow at the start but the score, I fear, is beyond Sri Lanka. @mohanstatsman: No team has ever made a 300+ total against Australia in any World Cups. Can SL be the first and also win? @cricketaakash: Weakness in Maxwell's play highlighted again...gives a chance in the 90s. What. A. Player@Sidvee: Not sure what is more mindblowing. Maxwell's astonishing strokeplay. Or Maxwell's 'I swear I didn't mean to do that' expression after. @RicFinley: Just when you think you have seen all manner of possible players, Glenn Maxwell comes along. He really is something special. Here's how twitter reacted to the crazy innings from Maxwell: Maxwell: "It's nice to finally get the monkey off the back. I've got a few 90s of late, but it's good to get the hundred. It's a big relief to finally get it out of the way. The top-order set it up nicely for us to have some fun in the end. We just have to bowl a good line and length to win. The wicket won't change much generally in Australia."At the other end of the spectrum, Sri Lankan players would be a disappointed lot. They bowled with good disciplines upfront before losing the plot. It could be said that they missed the services of Rangana Herath. Malinga bowled well in spurts, but he still looks short of his best. Unless they play out of their skins, one gets the feeling that Australia may have already batted Sri Lanka out of the game.One has to also remember that despite playing second fiddle to Maxwell for most of the time, Shane Watson essayed a key role in what turned out to be an enthralling partnership. Watson played some power-packed strokes, especially he cracked a thunderous shot over the mid-wicket region for a six off Mathews' bowling and went on to compose a well-deserved fifty. In fact, Watson's strike rate was 163.4.Maxwell played a glorious lofted shot off Dilshan to clear the ropes and start his innings on a great note. He proceeded to annihilate the opposition ranks. After the second drinks break, he hoicked Prasanna across the line for a six and virtually took the mickey out of the bowler with a switch hit in the same over to collect four more runs. In the 39th over of the innings, Thisara Perera looked to bowl a slower one, but it turned out to be a low full toss and not surprisingly, Maxwell thumped it for a six. Angelo Mathews looked to gamble with Prasanna in the 41st over of the game, but Maxwell flayed him for three boundaries. In the past, leg-spinners have troubled Maxwell with a potent googly, but Prasanna doesn't have one. It continued to rain fours and sixes from his willow and Perera came in for some severe punishment as he was clobbered for 20 runs in a single over. Maxwell eventually, completed his hundred in a mere 51 balls and was dismissed by Perera. But by then, the damage was already done. Earlier, Sri Lanka started on a good note, as Lasith Malinga generated a bit of away swing and deceived David Warner with a slower one to dismiss him. Aaron Finch, in an attempt to up the ante, looked to use his feet but was stumped off Seekkuge Prasanna's bowling. However, Clarke and Smith helped Australia to make a smart recovery. Both of them looked to milk the spinners with nimble wrists and by playing late. It was about smothering the spin on the front foot to shorten the length before looking to take advantage of the short delivery. Smith then completed a fine fifty. Clarke, who has been short of match practice in recent times, followed him by notching up a well-measured fifty too. However, Malinga and Tillakaratne Dilshan landed crucial blows to give Sri Lanka genuine hope of coming back into the game. Unfortunately for them, Maxwell shut the door, with those meaty blows. After Steven Smith and Michael Clarke set a solid platform with a well-constructed century stand, Glenn Maxwell used his willow like a magic wand to thwack Sri Lanka's bowlers to all corners of the ground and take them to a mammoth total on the board. Maxwell scored the second fastest century in World Cups. However, his ton turned out to be the fastest century for Australia in ODIs. It was also Maxwell's first hundred in ODIs. Australia will be very happy to see 376 on the board after opting to bat first. When Sri Lanka removed both openers early, it looked like Australia were going to score somewhere around 250-260, but some brilliant batting from the middle-order has given them a huge score.4

AUSTRALIA:49.5 Mathews to Johnson, 1 run, slower ball outside off stump, Johnson swings it to deep mid-wicketXavier Doherty, left handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:49.4 Mathews to Johnson, out Starc Run Out!! 1 run completed. Australia are losing wickets in a hurry but you can understand that in the situation, they are trying to steal every extra run possible. Slower ball well outside off stump, Johnson drills it to long-on, Starc tries races back for the second, but Perera fires a good throw to the bowler and Mathews knocks over the bails before Starc reached his crease. Aleem Dar didn't even want the TV replay. Starc run out (T Perera/Mathews) 0(0)Mathews to Johnson, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Mitchell Starc, left handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:49.3 Mathews to Haddin, out Caught by T Perera!! Slower ball on the off stump, Haddin tries to play the lofted shot over mid-off, but he ends up slicing it high in the air, Perera runs back from mid-off and takes a good catch. Haddin c T Perera b Mathews 25(9) [4s-4 6s-1]Mathews to Haddin, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:49.2 Mathews to Haddin, FOUR, Haddin gets across the stumps and swings hard at this full ball, gets it on the inside half of the bat, it goes through backward square leg and there was no one in the deep

AUSTRALIA:48.6 T Perera to Watson, out Caught by Chandimal!! That is a good catch by Chandimal. Slower ball outside off stump, Watson goes for the lofted hit but he's mistimed this completely. It went straight up in the air, mid-off takes a few steps back and completes a good catch to his left. End of a handy innings from Watto! Some respite for Perera as he gets to see 2 in the wickets column against him name. Watson c Chandimal b T Perera 67(41) [4s-7 6s-2]T Perera to Watson, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:48.5 T Perera to Haddin, 1 run, dropped. It was a tough chance, he caught it, but as his elbows hit the ground, it popped out. Full from Perera again, Haddin slogs and hits it flat, the fielder at deep mid-wicket runs to his right and dives, gets both hands to it but doesn't hold on
AUSTRALIA:48.4 T Perera to Haddin, FOUR, oh that's cruel for the bowler. He's bowled a fine yorker almost beat the batsman as he tried to dig it out, maybe there was an inside edge but it went off the back leg to the fine leg boundary
AUSTRALIA:48.3 T Perera to Haddin, FOUR, it's common sense that you shouldn't bowl full at the death! Perera is trying the yorker alright, but he simply is not able to control the ball. It's so easy for Haddin, with mid-off inside the ring, all he had to do was just chip it over the infield, which he did very well
AUSTRALIA:48.2 T Perera to Haddin, FOUR, shuffles in the crease, Perera goes full again, Haddin drives it to the right of extra-cover, where the Sri Lankan skipper dives over the ball and lets it go right through him. That should have been just one
AUSTRALIA:48.1 T Perera to Haddin, SIX, no! Bad ball! Wow! That was just a gentle lofted drive but it's gone all the way! How well has he timed it? Full and wide outside off stump, a lot of room on offer for the batsman and he doesn't miss out, sends the ball all the way over extra-coverSlinga ends 10-0-59-2
AUSTRALIA:47.6 Malinga to Haddin, 1 run, slower ball goes very full, Haddin drives it to the left of mid-off, who makes a sliding save. Just 4 runs off the over
AUSTRALIA:47.5 Malinga to Watson, 1 run, full and wide outside off stump, Watson had to reach out as he was initially making room, but he did well to connect the lofted drive very well, on the bounce to deep cover
AUSTRALIA:47.4 Malinga to Watson, no run, again makes room, but Slinga bowls a pin-point yorker and keeps Watto calm
AUSTRALIA:47.3 Malinga to Watson, no run, makes room and drills this full ball very hard, but straight to mid-off

AUSTRALIA:46.6 T Perera to Watson, 1 run, low full toss from Perera, Watson flicks it to deep mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:46.5 T Perera to Watson, FOUR, this is an amazing shot! How on earth did he manage to time that so well? It was full and way outside off stump, Watson had to reach out for it, in fact he lost balance while meeting the ball, yet he's managed to send it over extra-cover and more importantly time it sweetly
AUSTRALIA:46.4 T Perera to Watson, 2 runs, full and outside off stump, Watto walks across and drives it to long-on, Haddin races back to the second and the throw was very poor as wellBrad Haddin, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:46.3 T Perera to Faulkner, out Faulkner Run Out!! Full delivery outside off stump, Faulkner drives it straight to extra-cover and sets off. Perera had the presence of mind to rush back to stumps and Mathews fired an accurate throw adjacent to the stumps. Perera disturbed the stumps just before Faulkner made his ground. It's a golden duck for Faulkner. Faulkner run out (Mathews/T Perera) 0(1)T Perera to Faulkner, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Run-out check sent upstairs. Faulkner is short of his crease I guess. Oh yes! OUT
AUSTRALIA:46.2 T Perera to Watson, 1 run, very full outside off stump, Watson drives it to extra-coverJames Faulkner, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:46.1 T Perera to Maxwell, out Caught by Malinga!! Would you believe it! He was hitting those fuller ones, length balls, slowers balls, everything out of the ground, but he's mistimed a friendly full toss and offered a simple catch. Hang on! The umpires are checking for height on this high full toss. It's under the waist and Maxwell has to go. That's so poor from the umpire so send it upstairs. It was well under Maxwell's waist. Anyway, Maxwell walks off to great applause from the SCG crowd. He shows his bat to the crowd as he walks off. What an innings from Maxwell. He tried to swing this for six, but the bat turned it his hands and went straight up in the air, mid-on ran to his left and took a simple catch. Maxwell c Malinga b T Perera 102(53) [4s-10 6s-4]T Perera to Maxwell, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Thisara Perera [7.0-0-60-0] is back into the attack

AUSTRALIA:45.5 S Prasanna to Maxwell, 1 run, driven down to long-on
AUSTRALIA:45.4 S Prasanna to Maxwell, 2 runs, this is fastest ODI hundred for Australia and the second fastest World Cup hundred. Take a bow Maxwell. It's his maiden ODI hundred.

Flighted delivery outside off stump, Maxwell gently lofts it over wide mid-off
AUSTRALIA:45.3 S Prasanna to Watson, 1 run, a direct-hit would have been very interesting. Flighted delivery just outside off stump, Watson flicks it wide of mid-wicket and races to the bowler's end. Maxi is back on strike now

Flighted delivery full and outside off stump, Watson drills the drive very hard and back past the bowler, both long-off and long-on had no chance. Maxwell shakes hands with Watto and congratulates him
AUSTRALIA:45.1 S Prasanna to Watson, FOUR, Watto goes off-side very early, exposes the sticks and forces the bowler to bowl on the stumps and with short fine leg inside the ring, sweeps well and sends it to the left of the fielder thereSeekkuge Prasanna [9.0-0-61-1] is back into the attackGreat sportsmanship from Maxwell. When umpire Gould asked him, he could have easily said that he hit the ball and Gould would have had no choice but to signal a run, which would have given him the joint-fastest World Cup hundred.
AUSTRALIA:44.6 Malinga to Watson, 1 run, yorker length from Malinga, dug out to mid-on
AUSTRALIA:44.5 Malinga to Watson, no run, widish full ball, Watson backs away and fails to reach out
AUSTRALIA:44.4 Malinga to Maxwell, leg byes, 1 run, huge appeal for LBW, not given and rightly so, it was going down the leg-side. Drama! Umpire Gould doesn't signal leg bye for a long time, Maxwell reached the non-striker's end, Gould then asked Maxwell did you hit it, Maxwell said no and then the signal came for the leg bye
AUSTRALIA:44.3 Malinga to Watson, 1 run, low full toss as he tries the yorker, dug out to mid-on
AUSTRALIA:44.2 Malinga to Maxwell, 1 run, oh he can't get the fastest World Cup ton. Needed to do it this ball. Slower delivery on the leg stump, softly driven towards long-on. Maybe he didn't know about the record
AUSTRALIA:44.1 Malinga to Maxwell, 2 runs, full toss, Maxwell steps out and lofts it straight back over the bowler, long-on tidies up running to his left. He's onto 98Lasith Malinga [8.0-0-50-2] is back into the attack

AUSTRALIA:43.5 Mathews to Maxwell, 1 run, very full outside off stump, drilled to extra-cover
AUSTRALIA:43.4 Mathews to Maxwell, 2 runs, in the air, Sanga is running back and ohhh he's dropped it. It was a tough chance, but he did very well to get there. He would be disappointed for putting it down. Can Maxwell score a hundred today? We've seen him get out in the 90s so many times. Slower delivery down the leg-side, Maxwell tries to slog-sweep, gets a top edge, Sanga runs back, gets both hands to it but couldn't hold on
AUSTRALIA:43.3 Mathews to Maxwell, FOUR, no one at sweeper cover and that's a safe shot! Full and outside off stump, nothing ball indeed with that field. Maxwell goes leg-side and carves it over cover-point

AUSTRALIA:36.1 S Prasanna to Watson, 1 run, tossed up and on the stumps, driven down towards long-on for a singleSeekkuge Prasanna [7.0-0-27-1] is back into the attackWith Senanayake in the line-up, it was also surprising to note that they didn't use the around the wicket tactic to Clarke for a long time. It was only in the 31st over of the innings that Senanayake decided to bowl from around the wicket. Clarke likes to play through the mid-wicket region against off-spinners. But by bowling from around the wicket, with a short mid-wicket in place, it can frustrate Clarke and in the past, he has got out to that sort of line. It was successfully used by Graeme Swann in the fourth Ashes Test at the MCG in 2010-11. He tied down Clarke completely before he was dismissed with a straighter one in the second innings. A stumping chance too was missed in that innings.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 18 overs: Steven Smith and Michael Clarke looked to bisect the gaps in the field and take quick singles. Both the batsmen played late and with supple wrists to place the ball into gaps. They used the crease to good effect as well. Smith also completed a fine fifty. He has become the fulcrum of Australia's batting line-up this summer. Clarke followed up Smith's effort with a well-constructed half-century and then used his feet to play a sumptuous shot and smash a six off Sachithra Senanayake's bowling. He also essayed a glorious straight drive off Lasith Malinga, before Malinga gave a fitting riposte by shattering Clarke's stumps. To make it better for Sri Lanka, Thisara Perera took a fine catch to send Smith back to the pavilion. However, with Glenn Maxwell looking in fine touch, Australia look set to amass a sizeable total on the board. On the other hand, Sri Lanka's spinners tended to bowl short and their fielding was below par. Drinks are on the field now

Thisara runs back from mid-off, the fielder at long-on (Thirimanne) sprinted across as well. Perera watches the ball all along and takes it over his shoulder, makes sure that it didn't pop out when he hit the ground. Sri Lanka are back in the contest.

This was full and nipped back in late, Clarke was looking to whip it away towards the on-side, misses and the stumps are clattered. But hang on, is it a no-ball? Looks like Malinga had just a bit inside the popping crease, the wicket stands then but just by a hair's breadth. Clarke falls after a superb knock, a run-a-ball innings, he has set up Australia towards a huge score. Clarke b Malinga 68(68) [4s-6]Malinga to Clarke, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

AUSTRALIA:18.1 T Perera to S Smith, no run, fuller length delivery and on the stumps, Smith presents the full face of the bat and drives it towards mid-onThe track at the SCG is dry and that is surprising as in recent times, the groundsmen have left a bit of grass on the wicket. This wicket is similar to what one used to see at the SCG in the 1990s and early 2000s. Sri Lanka won't be complaining for sure.Malinga, then gave the chance for Finch to free his arms and he duly collected a boundary. Finch is comfortable when he plays back of a length bowling. Interestingly, it was Sachithra Senanayake, the off-spinner, who took the new ball at the other end. It is likely to do with the fact that David Warner and Finch thrive on pace on the ball and Senanayake can skid it off the surface with the new ball. It was Malinga though, who took advantage of Warner going hard at the ball by deceiving him with a slower one and snared his wicket. Finch in an attempt to take on Seekkuge Prasanna came down the wicket and was stumped. However, Smith and Michael Clarke looked to steady Australia's innings.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 18 overs: Lasith Malinga generated swing in the first over of the innings and should have taken the wicket of Aaron Finch as he edged a delivery that flew more through the vacant second slip. Surprisingly, Angelo Mathews decided to do away with the second slip after the first delivery and Finch survived. In ODIs, it has become imperative to take wickets upfront.Drinks are on the field now

This is where common sense has to prevail. They are taking a long time to check for the inside edge, when the impact was the main issue there. Well, they didn't show the Hawk-Eye, and the on-field decision stays. The third umpire assumed there was an inside edge and didn't go for the Hawk-Eye.

Finch is on strike. Malinga will open the attackThere are two slips in place. The countdown begins. Australia v Sri Lanka, here we go...Both the lovely anthems are done. The Sri Lankan team gets into a huddle. The Australian openers stride out.The teams are out for the anthems. Sri Lanka's "Sri Lanka Matha", is followed by Australia's, "Advance Australia Fair."Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Upul Tharanga, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith MalingaAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Xavier DohertyAustralia have won the toss and have opted to batMathews: "The batting unit has been really doing a great job in the past three games, hopefully they will continue and that's what we want as a team. Who gets set should go on to make a big one. And yeah, at SCG we've played pretty well in the past but that doesn't carry anything into this game. We've got to start afresh. Not really (asked if he was disappointed to lose the toss). The wicket will spin as, well right throughout the game. I think the spinners will come into play. But I think, if we bowl first or bat first doesn't matter as long as we keep them to chasable target. We've got three changes. Two injured, Herath, Dimuth and Lakmal go out, Sachithra, Seekkuge, Tharanga come in."Clarke: "Hopefully not (when asked if he would like to have a hit today). If I don't bat, it means we have played like we did in Perth, which is a great sign. Obviously a really big game for both teams. A sell-out crowd and the ground is in fantastic condition. All the Australian boys are really keen to get out here. We are going to have a bat. Get as many runs as we can. The wicket looks dry, I think change of pace and obviously spin is going to play a big part on this wicket. But, the outfield is very fast. So wickets in hand are going to be the key at the end of the innings for us. Couple of changes,  Shane Watson comes in for Mitchell Marsh. Xavier Doherty comes in for Josh Hazlewood. You have to ask the selectors (smiles, when asked why they made two changes.) But that's the XI they feel is the best XI to help us win this game against the opposition. I think they've gone a little bit horses for courses. We've got, obviously experience in Watto in regards to coming back in, only playing two front-line fast-bowlers then you've got the experience of Shane Watson with the ball as well and I think it's going to spin. That's why Doey is coming in."Pitch Report: "Can't wait for this game to start. The run-up is so smooth. The pitch looks an absolute cracker. Very, very flat, not too much of grass on it. Batting on this surface will be very good. The fast bowlers will get some swing early on and the spinners will get some purchase as well. Overall, both teams will score heavily," reckons Damien Fleming.Stat: Mahela Jayawardene will be playing his 446th ODI. He is set to become the most capped Sri Lankan batsman, going past Sanath Jayasuriya. He is now second in the overall list, behind Sachin Tendulkar - who earned 463 caps.When it comes to matches at the SCG, Sri Lanka surprisingly hold the edge over the Australians since the turn of the decade. They hold a 4-2 winning record with one match washed out.Head-to-head record: Australia have never lost to Sri Lanka in a World Cup match since the 1996 final in Lahore. Overall, it's a commanding 6-1 record in favour of the men from the Kangaroo nation.Weather Report: It's a cloudy day in Sydney. The temperature is expected to hover around 20 degrees with one or two spells of showers expected. But, it shouldn't play a big role in the proceedings.On the other hand, Sri Lanka have been hit by injuries. Dimuth Karunaratne was ruled out of the tournament and has been replaced by leg-spinner, Seekkugge Prasanna. Left-arm spinner, Rangana Herath, has been ruled out of today's match. It means one of Sachithra Senanayake or Prasanna might be featuring in the playing XI. There's also some talk about Sri Lanka playing an extra specialist batsman. In that case, Upul Tharanga, who came in as an injury replacement for Jeevan Mendis, is expected to slot into the middle-order.Team News: After struggling with injury concerns during the early stages of the tournament, Australia will now have a full roster of fifteen to select their playing XI. Shane Watson was surprisingly dropped for the match against Afghanistan and early reports indicate that he might be back for this game. With a dry surface expected, Xavier Doherty, might get his first match of the tournament. If Australia do make the two changes, Mitchell Marsh and Josh Hazlewood are two players expected to make way.So what lies ahead? One of the biggest matches of Pool A, the winner of this match will in all probability finish second in the pool. That sets them up for a clash with one of Pakistan or Ireland, depending on the result of the match between those two teams on March 15th. On the other hand, the loser will perhaps end up facing South Africa in the quarter-finals, something that the two teams wouldn't want, so early in the knock-out stages.The Pitch: Australia's strength has been the dominant form of their pacers and it's no surprise that they were taken aback at the dry nature of the SCG surface. 'Looking at the pitch, if we had to play today, the toss would be crucial. But a day of sun on the pitch and a bit of rolling tomorrow might make it a little bit different," was Michael Clarke's assessment of the pitch. Surely, Sri Lanka couldn't have asked for a friendlier wicket than the one that they are expected to play on today.Skipper, Angelo Mathews, is confident about putting up a good show. "Recently when we clashed against the Australians in England, we beat them. In Australia as well, I remember a few years ago. So we have the capacity and we have the skill," he said, during the pre-match conference.Sri Lanka: The sub-continental giants are slowly peaking at the right time. After a poor start where they lost to red-hot New Zealand, Angelo Mathews' men have reeled off three straight wins, a hard-fought one against Afghanistan followed by two cruises against Bangladesh and England respectively. They haven't been tested recently though - and that test will come up when they square up against Johnson, Starc and Co.Another factor that has bogged down the hosts is the amount of travelling. Despite being co-hosts, they have clocked the second most air-miles amongst all the teams in the tournament. Finch though refused to complain, adding that it was part and parcel of being professional cricketers. "It's been difficult. Anytime you're changing time zones as dramatic as Auckland to Perth, it's quite tough. But we did everything possible to counteract that. There's really no excuse for the boys not to be fresh for the game. It's the World Cup. You embrace everything about it, you don't complain, you just get on with it," Finch said.The hosts are aware of the challenge that Sri Lanka is likely to pose. This is what opening batsman, Aaron Finch, had to say. "This is a big game, it's important. You don't want to finish in the bottom two in your group. It does make it a little bit harder in your path to the final, if you go that far (as to lose on Sunday)."Australia: It hasn't been smooth riding for the red-hot favorites. After a convincing win over England in the opener, rain robbed them of a potentially easy win against Bangladesh. Deprived of match-practice, they crashed to a nail-biting one-wicket loss against New Zealand in Auckland. Back on their home turf, they bossed around an inexperienced Afghan unit to get their campaign back on track. Sri Lanka is a different challenge all-together and is perhaps one team that hasn't been cowed down by the Aussies on their home turf.13:10 Local Time, 02:10 GMT, 07:40 IST: It's super Sunday and it can't get better with two traditional powerhouses up against each other in a key World Cup match. Hosts Australia take on Sri Lanka in a match that might well decide the second place in Pool A. Both teams are coming into this game on the back of convincing wins. Australia set a World Cup record by scoring 417 and then dismissed Afghanistan for 142, thereby recording a 275-run win, the biggest in World Cups. On the other hand, Sri Lanka made light of a challenging target set by England, chasing down 309 for the loss of just one wicket. Sparks are certain to fly as the two teams meet each other at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG). Before we go any further, here's the form map of both teamsPreview by G RajaramanThe Sydney Cricket Ground pitch confounded Australia and Sri Lanka on the eve of their ICC Cricket World Cup Group A clash on Sunday. Yet, the opponents, whose predecessors rarely ignored the chance to bring needle into play, have promised to deliver a high-voltage game, irrespective of how the pitch pans out.Australia captain Michael Clarke said spin would play a big part since the SCG pitch looked dry; Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews pointed out that the track had looked different each day over the past three days. Soon, the Sri Lankans were watching the groundstaff give the track a spray of water, sprinkled some blades of grass and rolled them in.With Clarke praising Kumar Sangakkara and speaking highly of Sri Lanka and with Mathews talking of the co-hosts as being hard to beat, Saturday was not the time to look for the needle that existed the last time when a team from the Emerald Isle beat Australia in a World Cup game back in the 1996 final at Lahore.Of course, this is only a league game, with the teams fighting for second place in the group behind New Zealand. At stake is the chance to avoid India or South Africa in the quarterfinals but both skippers have pointed out that instead of trying to avoid a side, it would be better to reconcile to the fact that to win the World Cup, a team will have to beat the best opposition.Clarke, in the limelight because of his high-profile rehabilitation from injury and his run-in with Chairman of Selectors Rod Marsh, and Mathews would rather focus on Sunday's match so that they could sustain the winning momentum as the business end of the World Cup draws close. Clarke admitted that he had enough to worry about without looking at the weather.For, Australia's campaign has acquired a start-stop-restart look and Clarke is hoping that his team will carry the momentum from the massive victory over Afghanistan in Perth while Sri Lanka overcame the opening game defeat by New Zealand to post three straight wins against Afghanistan, Bangladesh and England.The teams are bound, however, by issues of selection. Australia have come under some pressure from former captain Ricky Ponting who said the decision to drop Shane Watson from the XI left the middle-order short of experience. Clarke took refuge in the fact that he is not a selector and spoke glowingly about the team's senior-most allrounder.Sri Lanka, on the contrary, have been hit by injury to left-arm spinner Rangana Herath and will need to consider recasting the composition of the XI a bit. Legspinner Seekkuge Prasanna could find himself a place ahead of 'mystery spinner' Sachithra Senanayake. The injury to Dimuth Karunaratne will possibly give Upul Tharana a chance to be one of the seven batsmen.With Sri Lanka expecting a great deal of support - Mahela Jayawardena hoped that the Sri Lankans would outnumber the Australians in the stands on Sunday - SCG could be the apt stage for Mathews' team to post their first World Cup win over Australia in five matches. Their spinners, even if not first-choice, can seek to play on the minds of the home batsmen.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Seekkuge Prasanna, Lasith Malinga, Suranga Lakmal, Upul Tharanga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Dushmantha ChameeraAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins, George Bailey, Shane Watson, Xavier DohertyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
