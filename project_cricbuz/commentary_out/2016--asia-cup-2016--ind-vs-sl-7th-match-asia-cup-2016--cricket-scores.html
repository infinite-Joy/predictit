INDIA:19.2 19.2Herath to Kohli, FOUR, nicely done and India record their third win on the trot in the tournament. So they are guaranteed of a place in the final. Flighted delivery on the leg stump, Kohli steps out and flicks it over mid-wicket, no one in the deep and it's a one-bounce fourSlip in place and the field is up
INDIA:19.1 Herath to Kohli, no run, Kohli advances and drives straight to cover
INDIA:18.6 Siriwardana to Kohli, 1 run, driven down to long-on and the scores are level
INDIA:18.5 Siriwardana to Kohli, FOUR, Kohli steps out and then drives over extra-cover to raise his fifty. Just a gentle raise of the bat and his team-mates applaud from the dug-out. Once again, Kohli plays a good knock under pressure. Siriwardana tried to bowl wide outside off stump on seeing the batsman advance, but Kohli reached out and nailed it
INDIA:18.4 Siriwardana to Dhoni, 1 run, turns this to mid-wicket for a single
INDIA:18.3 Siriwardana to Dhoni, SIX, that was so cool from captain cool! Mathews made a field change, but Dhoni decides to go aerial and really muscles it. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Dhoni steps out, gets into great position and hits the sightscreenInteresting from Mathews. He has a straight mid-off to prevent that easy single
INDIA:18.2 Siriwardana to Dhoni, no run, tossed up outside off stump, Dhoni drives and finds cover
INDIA:18.1 Siriwardana to Kohli, 1 run, flighted delivery on the leg stump, Kohli works it to mid-wicket. Kohli thought about the second run, but Dhoni said noMilinda Siriwardana, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack14 needed off the last two overs. With Kohli and Dhoni at the crease and the likes of Jadeja, Ashwin waiting to come, you should back India, but you never know!
INDIA:17.6 Herath to Dhoni, no run, flighted delivery on the off stump, Dhoni defends off the front footMS Dhoni, right handed bat, comes to the creaseIndia need 14 off 13. Is there a twist in the tale?
INDIA:17.5 Herath to Pandya, out Bowled!! That is a horrible shot across the line to a ball that's spinning away from the right-hander from round the wicket. Really ugly shot and Sanjay Bangar, the batting coach, won't be happy with the youngster. Flighted delivery pitching around off and turning, Pandya tried to go towards mid-wicket and also lost balance, the turn took it past the bat and rattled the off stump. Pandya b Herath 2(4)Herath to Pandya, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:17.4 Herath to Pandya, 2 runs, Pandya steps out and lofts inside-out, off the toe-end of the bat, but luckily it lands safely between long-off and deep extra-coverSlip in place
INDIA:17.3 Herath to Pandya, no run, very full and on the stumps, Pandya drives it back to the bowler
INDIA:17.2 Herath to Pandya, no run, driven to cover
INDIA:17.1 Herath to Kohli, 1 run, tossed up on the leg stump, Kohli backs away and drives along the ground to long-offRangana Herath [2.0-0-19-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:16.6 T Perera to Kohli, 1 run, very full and outside off stump, Kohli drives it to sweeper cover once moreHardik Pandya, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:16.5 T Perera to Yuvraj, out Caught by Kulasekara!! And the short ball has got rid of Yuvraj. Not once did he time the pull shot well today! Anyway, he's made his impact and that's the end of a fine cameo from Yuvraj Singh. Short delivery on the stumps, came quickly onto the left-hander, Yuvraj was hurried on the pull and he only managed to top edge it to fine leg. The replay shows that Yuvi turned his head and did not watch the ball right till the end. No real celebration from Sri Lanka as they know that India have this in the bag. Yuvraj c Kulasekara b T Perera 35(18) [4s-3 6s-3]T Perera to Yuvraj, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:16.4 T Perera to Yuvraj, FOUR, mid-off moved to his right and thought about jumping and grabbing it, but that was hit with power and the fieldsman had no chance. Yuvraj Singh is striking them over 200! Bit of glove-love between the batsmen as Kohli walks and punches Yuvraj's glove in appreciation for that shot. Overpitched in the slot, Yuvraj doesn't try anything fancy, just lofts the drive wide of mid-off for four
INDIA:16.3 T Perera to Kohli, 1 run, overpitched outside off stump, Kohli reaches out and drives along the ground to sweeper cover
INDIA:16.2 T Perera to Kohli, no run, Kohli steps out and wants to drive through the off-side, but this goes off the inside-edge to mid-onOnce again the umpires discuss the ball. Meanwhile, Kohli walks towards Dilshan to have a friendly chat. This is how the equation looks: 23 needed off 23.
INDIA:16.1 T Perera to Kohli, FOUR, for a moment it appeared as if Kohli was bowled there, but it escaped past the sticks. Cruel for the bowler, for he actually won the moral battle there. Shortish delivery outside off stump, Kohli goes for the pull, toe-ends it past the off stump
INDIA:15.6 Chameera to Yuvraj, no run, ah! Beaten on the pull again. I'd love to see Yuvraj Singh nail a pull shot today. This is the third time he's missed/mistimed a pull in the last few balls if I am not wrong. Short delivery angled across, Yuvraj swings and misses
INDIA:15.5 Chameera to Yuvraj, FOUR, cramped on the pull was Yuvraj Singh by this pacy short ball, he got inside the line a bit and managed to help it away awkwardly, the fact that fine leg was very square meant he had no chance. Must say that the line was leg-stumpish, which made life slightly easier for the batsman to execute that shot
INDIA:15.4 Chameera to Kohli, 1 run, goes hard at the back foot punch this time, but the placement isn't good enough as sweeper cover comes into the picture once again
INDIA:15.3 Chameera to Yuvraj, 1 run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Yuvraj turns it off the back foot through square leg
INDIA:15.2 Chameera to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli spoke about opening the face of the bat at the last moment on this pitch in the last match and he's using the same ploy again. So many runs down to third man, another slower ball that's been guided to third man
INDIA:15.1 Chameera to Kohli, no run, leg-cutting slower delivery outside off stump, Kohli defends this to backward point
INDIA:14.6 T Perera to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli steps out and slaps the short of length delivery to sweeper cover
INDIA:14.5 T Perera to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli taps it to backward point
INDIA:14.4 T Perera to Yuvraj, 1 run, in the airrrrr and just short. Yuvraj looks at the bottom of his bat straightaway. Short delivery on the stumps, Yuvraj goes for the pull, once again toe-ends it, the fielder at deep square leg runs forward, dives but just couldn't get there in time
INDIA:14.3 T Perera to Yuvraj, SIX, that's brave from Yuvi and he's raced to 25 off just 12 balls. Yuvraj backed away and exposed all three sticks, Perera fired the length ball on the stumps, Yuvraj went for the loft over cover and gee, the timing was so good that hit cleared the boundary with ease
INDIA:14.2 T Perera to Yuvraj, no run, it's clear, Yuvraj will play his shots, Kohli will keep it simple. Short and just outside off stump, Yuvraj would have backed himself to pull that hard any day, but this time only manages to toe-end the pull onto his boot. Yuvraj is disappointed with himself after missing out there
INDIA:14.1 T Perera to Kohli, 1 run, looks like Kohli wants to bat through and is playing second fiddle to Yuvraj. Just keen to rotate strike and get Yuvi back on strike, dabs it to the left of backward point for an easy runThisara Perera [2.0-0-13-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:13.6 Chameera to Yuvraj, no run, good finish to the over from Chameera as he collects three dots. On a length and on the off stump, Yuvraj defends from the crease, sort of inside-edge that one
INDIA:13.5 Chameera to Yuvraj, no run, beaten again! Fast and full outside off stump, Yuvraj throws his bat at it in an attempt to drive hard, only met with thin air
INDIA:13.4 Chameera to Yuvraj, no run, surely, Yuvraj Singh misjudged the length there. He was thinking it was a length ball, but it was slightly shorter, Yuvraj went nowhere with his feet movement, just tried to play with one hand and was completely squared up, luckily for him he didn't nick off
INDIA:13.3 Chameera to Kohli, 1 run, slower delivery outside off stump, the leg-cutter attempted, Kohli opens the face of the bat and runs it down to third man
INDIA:13.2 Chameera to Yuvraj, 1 run, oh a lovely drive from Yuvraj. Pacy bowler is Chameera, but Yuvraj was ready for that drive, there is protection in deep and it's just a runSlight stoppage in play. Not sure why though!
INDIA:13.2 Chameera to Yuvraj, wide, first ball to Yuvraj and Chameera straightaway opts for the bumper, this is ill-directed though as it went down the leg-side
INDIA:13.1 Chameera to Kohli, 1 run, slower delivery on the stumps, Kohli was looking to nudge it into the on-side, gets a leading edge that rolls past the non-striker to long-onDushmantha Chameera [2.0-0-16-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:12.6 Herath to Yuvraj, SIX, now this is sweetly timed as well and this has a lot of height on it. These two sixes have completely changed the momentum once again in India's favour. Great counter-punch from Yuvraj. With the left-arm spinner bowling round the wicket and spinning it back into him, Yuvraj rightly targets mid-wicket and this was just a flick which went all the way
INDIA:12.5 Herath to Yuvraj, SIX, catch is the call but it's gone all the way. That didn't go that high, but Yuvraj hit it so well that it cleared the fence. Flighted delivery from Herath, Yuvraj steps out and muscles the lofted-drive, I thought Thisara Perera had to do better there at long-on. Maybe a more agile fielder would have at least put in the dive and tried his bestHerath throws the ball to the umpire and the umpires converge to check its health. Are they going to change it? No, they don't!
INDIA:12.4 Herath to Kohli, 1 run, too full to trouble the batsman, easily driven to long-off
INDIA:12.3 Herath to Yuvraj, 1 run, Yuvraj steps out and then gently drives the flighted delivery to long-on
INDIA:12.2 Herath to Kohli, 1 run, oh that's a lovely inside-out front foot cover-drive, but the man at sweeper is stationed to keep it down to a single. Surely looked like four when it left the bat
INDIA:12.1 Herath to Kohli, no run, flighted delivery on the leg stump, Kohli wanted to nudge, went off the soft leading edge back to the bowler
INDIA:11.6 Dasun Shanaka to Kohli, 1 run, very full and outside off stump, Kohli walks forward and drives along the ground to sweeper cover to keep strike
INDIA:11.5 Dasun Shanaka to Yuvraj, 1 run, shortish delivery on the stumps, Yuvraj gets his foot across the line and then helps it down through backward square leg
INDIA:11.4 Dasun Shanaka to Yuvraj, FOUR, poor ball and Yuvraj opens his account with a four. Short and wide outside off stump, Yuvraj cuts and cuts deliberately in the air over backward point, the timing was good enough and it beat third man as well
INDIA:11.3 Dasun Shanaka to Yuvraj, no run, full delivery from Dasun Shanaka, Yuvraj drives, the bowler half-stops and sends it to mid-on
INDIA:11.2 Dasun Shanaka to Kohli, 1 run, very full and outside off stump, Kohli squeezes it out to sweeper cover off the front footYuvraj Singh, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:11.1 Dasun Shanaka to Raina, out Caught by Kulasekara!! In the airrrrr, oh that almost popped out, but luckily for Sri Lanka, Kula grabbed it on the third attempt. Hang on! The umpire wants to check for the no-ball. Oh dear! That was well inside the line. Didn't the umpire see that at all? Not close or tight enough to be sent upstairs. Dasun Shanaka strikes first ball of his spell. Full and just swinging back in a touch, Raina wanted to loft the drive straight down the ground, the ball hit the outside half of the bat and went straight up in the air, was a simple grab for Kula at mid-off. The ball hit the wrists and came out, luckily bounced off the chest and then he was able to juggle once more and take it finally. So a good partnership has been broken. Raina c Kulasekara b Dasun Shanaka 25(26) [4s-2]Dasun Shanaka to Raina, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Dasun Shanaka, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:10.6 Herath to Kohli, no run, shortish and on the stumps, Kohli back foot punches it to mid-wicket. That one came quickly off the surface
INDIA:10.5 Herath to Raina, 1 run, Raina flicks this off his pads to deep square leg, Raina thinks about two but Kohli says no
INDIA:10.4 Herath to Kohli, 1 run, nicely bowled, but well played too. Bowled slower through the air on leg stump line, Kohli waits for the ball to come, delays the drive and sends it along the ground to long-offNow there is a man at slip
INDIA:10.3 Herath to Raina, 1 run, this is tossed up very full, driven down to long-on
INDIA:10.2 Herath to Raina, no run, shortish from Herath, Raina was on the back foot for the punch, kept a bit low but Raina had it covered and played it back to the bowlerNo slip in place
INDIA:10.1 Herath to Kohli, 1 run, very full and on the stumps, Kohli drives it down to long-offRangana Herath, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attackAt the halfway stage, India are 66/2 and they need 73 more to seal this game. Can Sri Lanka stage a tremendous comeback
INDIA:9.6 Chameera to Raina, no run, another bumper, second of the over, Raina ducks, looks at the square leg umpire, who rules that as a legal delivery
INDIA:9.5 Chameera to Raina, FOUR, top shot and the fifty partnership comes up. Good length delivery just outside off stump, the bowler will argue that he didn't bowl a bad ball, for it surely wasn't leg-stumpish or down the leg-side for Raina to play so easily through mid-wicket. Just that the batsman outsmarted the bowler by that slight movement across the stumps which made life so easy for him. Once it beat mid-on, it was always going to be four
INDIA:9.4 Chameera to Raina, no run, Raina moves inside the line, the short ball comes and the batsman just lets it go, not called a wide as it almost went over the leg stump
INDIA:9.3 Chameera to Kohli, 1 run, and this time the timing almost costs him his wicket. Good length delivery outside off stump, Kohli plays the defence with hard hands, almost carries to the man at cover, who fails to stop the ball
INDIA:9.2 Chameera to Kohli, 2 runs, just the extension of arms on this back of a length delivery, so much width on offer outside off stump, Kohli plays with an angled bat and beats backward point, the ball races across, Perera runs to his right and relays to the man running from sweeper cover. What timing from Kohli
INDIA:9.1 Chameera to Raina, 1 run, another easy flick to mid-wicketNo risk taken by both batsmen, yet they scored 16 runs off the last two overs. Tells you about the open spaces in the field and the sensible batting by both Kohli and Raina to focus on just working the ball in the gaps.
INDIA:8.6 T Perera to Raina, 1 run, big open spaces on the on-side and Raina just turns this delivery towards mid-wicket to keep strike
INDIA:8.5 T Perera to Raina, 2 runs, driven off the front foot and past Kohli at the other end, Mathews runs behind it and saves two with a slide, a relay throw to the bowler in the end
INDIA:8.4 T Perera to Kohli, 1 run, easily worked off the back foot to square leg, the length was way too short from Perera on that occasion
INDIA:8.3 T Perera to Raina, 1 run, punchy drive off the front foot, in fact on the walk through cover
INDIA:8.2 T Perera to Raina, 2 runs, Raina hops and tucks this wide of mid-on, the batsmen put Mathews under pressure by running hard, he had a bit of ground to cover running to his left and couldn't prevent the second
INDIA:8.1 T Perera to Kohli, 1 run, short of length just outside off stump, Kohli moves across and uses his wrists to work it to mid-wicket
INDIA:7.6 Chameera to Kohli, 1 run, short delivery on the stumps, Kohli easily pulls to fine leg, slight fumble but no extra run conceded
INDIA:7.5 Chameera to Raina, 1 run, a quick bowler on and Raina anticipates the short delivery, moves across the stumps, as expected Chameera bangs it short and Raina pulls it fine to fine leg, the fielder in the deep runs to his left to save three
INDIA:7.4 Chameera to Kohli, 1 run, sensible from Kohli, got the boundary for the over, just wants to tap and run and he plays with an angled bat and close to the body as well to run it down to third man
INDIA:7.3 Chameera to Kohli, FOUR, wow! That's a crunchy front foot punch, bowled at 149kph and it raced across the turf even faster. Not a muscle moved in the field. Full delivery outside off stump, Kohli comes on the front foot and crunches it between mid-off and extra-cover for four
INDIA:7.2 Chameera to Raina, 1 run, easy pickings this time for Raina as he could easily tuck this back of a length delivery to square leg because Chameera bowled a leg-stump line
INDIA:7.1 Chameera to Raina, no run, careful Raina, careful! Too much risk involved in that shot, which would have only got him a single. Short of a length delivery angled across, as I said earlier, rotation of strike is on Raina's mind, he tries to run this down to third man, played away from the body and almost edged it to the keeperDushmantha Chameera, right-arm fast, comes into the attackSince the powerplay is done, looks like these two have a clear plan to rotate the strike.
INDIA:6.6 T Perera to Raina, 1 run, once again another dab down to third man, this time from Raina's bat
INDIA:6.5 T Perera to Kohli, 1 run, enough width on offer outside off stump for Kohli to run it down to third man
INDIA:6.4 T Perera to Raina, 1 run, Raina mistimes the back foot punch to the right of cover, Siriwardana moves to his right and has a shy at the striker's end, forces Kohli to stretch, anyway it wasn't a direct-hit
INDIA:6.3 T Perera to Kohli, 1 run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Kohli waits on the back foot and flicks to mid-wicket
INDIA:6.2 T Perera to Kohli, no run, there is that movement across the stumps from Kohli and it almost gets him into trouble here. Length delivery on the stumps, Kohli wanted to work it into the on-side, probably the ball left him late and opened him up a bit, rolls to cover off the outer half of the bat
INDIA:6.1 T Perera to Raina, 1 run, on a length and outside off stump, Raina drives off the front foot through coverThisara Perera, right-arm medium, comes into the attackPowerplay done! Decent beginning for both sides. India won't be too unhappy with the runs and Sri Lanka would be thrilled with those two early scalps.
INDIA:5.6 Kulasekara to Kohli, FOUR, this is a very good shot from Kohli. He knows that Kulasekara is going to bowl wide outside off stump. Walks towards the bowler and then across the line as well, drives sweetly from the middle of the bat through cover and it races away for four
INDIA:5.5 Kulasekara to Raina, 1 run, shortish and on the off stump, Raina pulls along the ground to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:5.4 Kulasekara to Raina, 2 runs, can't bowl there to Raina, but Kulasekara gets away with it as Raina didn't time that pick-up shot. Normally he's so good with it. Good length delivery on the leg stump, Raina goes over backward square leg, Chameera gets there running to his right from fine leg, fields and then gets rid of the ball just before touching the rope and that's two runs saved
INDIA:5.3 Kulasekara to Kohli, 1 run, short of length on the stumps, Kohli wrists it to backward square leg, Kohli wanted two but Raina sent him back
INDIA:5.2 Kulasekara to Kohli, no run, on a length and just outside off stump, Kohli gets his front foot right across the line and then drives it to mid-off
INDIA:5.1 Kulasekara to Kohli, FOUR, in the airrr, the fielder at cover-point jumps but it evades him. Full and outside off stump, Kohli went for the drive, probably wanted to hit it through cover, but the bat turned in his hands on impact with the ball, went off the outside half and managed to clear the infield
INDIA:4.6 Mathews to Raina, no run, once again Raina hits one uppishly, this time a checked flick and for a moment, Mathews was interested as it flew to his left, stuck his left hand out but it was out of his reach and rolled to mid-on
INDIA:4.5 Mathews to Raina, no run, oops! That was awkward from Raina. Short delivery angled across, didn't rise much, Raina thought about the pull initially, held the bat high and then all of sudden dropped his hands, the ball safely sailed through to the keeper though
INDIA:4.4 Mathews to Kohli, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli easily runs it down to third man
INDIA:4.3 Mathews to Kohli, no run, Kohli gets a stride forward and then works this length delivery towards mid-on
INDIA:4.2 Mathews to Kohli, FOUR, oh just a flick off the back foot, but this bloke is a strong bottom-handed player, the ball cleared the man at mid-wicket and Herath never had a chance running to his left from the deep
INDIA:4.1 Mathews to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, wristed to mid-wicket
INDIA:3.6 Kulasekara to Raina, FOUR, in the air but past the man at mid-wicket. Kulasekara bowls a leg-stump line, Raina flicks uppishly, luckily for him the placement was good as it went to the left of the man at mid-wicket. Off the mark in a streaky fashion
INDIA:3.5 Kulasekara to Raina, no run, this time Raina gets hit on the box and that's painful. Walks away for a moment and signals that he's fine to carry on. Once again the incoming delivery on a good length, Raina is so poor with his feet movement that he just hops in the crease and tries to defend, missed the ball completely and it hurt him a bit
INDIA:3.4 Kulasekara to Raina, no run, oh almost through the gate/lbw! The scrambled seam good length delivery from Kulasekara, Raina drives with a big bat-pad gap, the ball jags back in and crashes into the pad after taking the inside edge. That would have been pretty plumb had there been no bat involved
INDIA:3.3 Kulasekara to Raina, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, Raina defendsTwo slips for RainaSuresh Raina, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:3.2 Kulasekara to Rohit, out Caught by Kapugedera!! Just a fly slip and it goes straight to him. Must say that it was a sharp low catch. The fielder did very well to stay low, which was key to this grab. Fullish and outside off stump, Rohit plays a loose drive away from the body, the ball just moves away from the body and takes a thick outside edge, Kapugedera does the rest. Rohit wears a disappointed look as he removes his gloves on his way back. This is an excellent start for Sri Lanka. It's 16/2 inside 4 overs and the pressure is on India. Rohit c Kapugedera b Kulasekara 15(14) [4s-3]Kulasekara to Rohit, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:3.1 Kulasekara to Rohit, no run, "noooo" shouts Rohit, after toe-ending the off-drive to mid-off. He knows that he should have done better with it, for it was full and right in the slot to be put away
INDIA:2.6 Mathews to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Kohli offers a compact back foot defence
INDIA:2.5 Mathews to Kohli, no run, on a length and pretty straight from Mathews, Kohli gently knocks it towards mid-wicket
INDIA:2.4 Mathews to Kohli, no run, full and outside off stump, Kohli drives off the front foot and finds the man at mid-off
INDIA:2.3 Mathews to Rohit, 1 run, too straight from Mathews, Rohit wrists it to long leg
INDIA:2.2 Mathews to Rohit, no run, Rohit drives it back to the bowler off the inside-half of the bat
INDIA:2.1 Mathews to Rohit, FOUR, in the airrrrr and almost 2 in 2 for Sri Lanka. Mathews shakes his head as he walks back to his bowling mark, but that was a good effort by Chameera. Fullish and on the stumps, Rohit checks the flick shot, was in the air for a while, mid-on rushes and dives full length forward, but it falls just short and Chameera couldn't get his body behind the ball as well and it escapes for fourVirat Kohli, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:1.6 Kulasekara to Dhawan, out Caught by Chandimal!! There you go! Right-arm pacer bowling over the wicket, the angle will take it away from the left-handed batsman and Dhawan was reluctant to move his feet and falls in the trap. Injured Lasith Malinga is delighted with that early wicket and cheers from the dug-out. Really nothing great about this delivery, just basic cricket from Kulasekara and how important are basics in life! On a good length in the corridor of uncertainty, Dhawan, who is returning from an injury, pokes at it without much of feet movement and gets a healthy edge to the keeper. Simple catch for the man behind the sticks. Dhawan c Chandimal b Kulasekara 1(3)Kulasekara to Dhawan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:1.5 Kulasekara to Rohit, 1 run, allows the length delivery to come and works it towards backward square leg
INDIA:1.4 Kulasekara to Rohit, FOUR, no, no, no! That's full and juicy, Rohit helps himself to an easy boundary. Kulasekara fires it full and on the stumps, probably looking for some swing, but this went straight on and Rohit easily lofts it over mid-on for a one-bounce four
INDIA:1.3 Kulasekara to Rohit, no run, Rohit was slightly opened up by the late away movement on this short of length delivery outside off stump, the back foot punch goes off the outer half of the bat towards cover
INDIA:1.2 Kulasekara to Rohit, no run, this is slightly back of a length and Rohit is solid in his back foot defence
INDIA:1.1 Kulasekara to Rohit, no run, good delivery and bad stroke from Rohit. Good length delivery just moving away outside off stump, Rohit plays acres away from the body in trying to defend and ends up feeling for it, lucky not to have edged that to the keeperNuwan Kulasekara, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackCan Kulasekara get it to swing considerably? He has a slip waiting for the edge.
INDIA:0.6 Mathews to Rohit, 1 run, short of length delivery angled, Rohit turns it through backward square leg and keeps strike
INDIA:0.5 Mathews to Rohit, FOUR, this is easy for Rohit, who is in great form. So much width on offer outside off stump and Mathews is not express pace as well, Rohit waits on the back foot and easily cuts it away between cover-point and backward point. So Rohit opens his account with a boundary
INDIA:0.4 Mathews to Rohit, no run, hit on the pad and a half-hearted shout from Mathews for LBW. The scrambled seam delivery on a good length, probably just nipped back in, Rohit was on the back foot to work it into the on-side, misses and is hit high on the thigh pad. Height was an issue and it might have missed leg stump as well
INDIA:0.3 Mathews to Rohit, no run, away-going delivery on a good length, Rohit lets it go to the keeperJust one slip for Rohit as well
INDIA:0.2 Mathews to Dhawan, 1 run, Dhawan gets the bottom of the bat on his punch and sets off, not a clean pick up from the man at extra-cover running to his left and in the end it's an easy run. As soon he tapped that length ball, Dhawan called for the run
INDIA:0.1 Mathews to Dhawan, no run, that's a gentle delivery first up from Mathews. This full ball almost floated towards the batsman, the away-going ball wide outside off stump, Dhawan toe-ends the drive towards coverDhawan and Rohit are at the crease. Dhawan is on strike. Mathews will open the attackWelcome back for the run chase. India have their regular opening partnership back. Rohit and Dhawan stride out. Mathews will take the new ball with a slip in place. Fine leg is inside the ring as well. The countdown goes 3, 2, 1 and here we go!Milinda Siriwardana entered and combined well with Kapugedera to keep the momentum going, but the former mistiming a slog and holing out to Suresh Raina triggered another collapse as Sri Lanka lost 3 wickets for 5 runs. However, a few meaty blows from Thisara Perera and Nuwan Kulasekara helped Sri Lanka cross the 130-run mark. Pandya, Ashwin, Bumrah - all bagged two wickets apiece. Mathews and Co. have something to bowl at. The new ball is doing its bit. Will the dew make life tougher for the Sri Lankan bowlers? We'll wait and watch...Sri Lanka's woes with the bat continued as the top-order once again failed to get the side off to a good start. Ashish Nehra continued his good form with the new ball by accounting for Dinesh Chandimal in his second over. Jasprit Bumrah impressed once again with his skiddy pace and also troubled the batsmen with movement off the pitch - eventually got Shehan Jayasuriya as well. Hardik Pandya came on and straightaway removed Tillakaratne Dilshan to reduce Sri Lanka to 31/3. Just as Chamara Kapugedera and Angelo Mathews were upping the ante, Pandya castled the latter against the run of play.1
SRI LANKA:19.6 Nehra to Kulasekara, out Kulasekara Run Out!! 1 run completed. He had to come back for the second. And falls while doing so. A full toss clubbed to deep mid-wicket, Kohli rifles a throw on the bounce to MS who whips the bails off, catching the diving Kulasekara short. Just short but the throw was right over the bails and that made it easy for MS as well. Kulasekara run out (Kohli/Dhoni) 13(9) [4s-2]Nehra to Kulasekara, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
SRI LANKA:19.5 Nehra to Kulasekara, no run, just inside the swinging bat and the tramline. Slower and beats Kulasekara's slog. Bounces through to Mahendra Singh DhoniYes he does!
SRI LANKA:19.4 Nehra to Kulasekara, FOUR, poor from Nehra, another full toss, this time outside off, allows Kulasekara to go over cover. Stylishly done, and beats sweeper cover. Will Nehra come round the wicket now?
SRI LANKA:19.3 Nehra to Kulasekara, FOUR, that's Kulasekara's area. Over mid-wicket. Low full toss on the stumps, heaved over mid-wicket. No-one at deep mid-wicket and that's a boundary
SRI LANKA:19.2 Nehra to Chameera, 1 run, length ball on off, Chameera makes room and slices the big hit, runs off a thickish outside edge to third man
SRI LANKA:19.1 Nehra to Kulasekara, 1 run, low full toss outside off, Kulasekara slashes hard and gets a thick outside edge to third manAshish Nehra [3.0-0-12-1] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:18.6 Ashwin to Kulasekara, 1 run, on middle, Kulasekara early into the flick, a leading edge rolls to cover, Kulasekara retains the strike with that run
SRI LANKA:18.5 Ashwin to Chameera, 1 run, the leggie bowled with a different action, clipped through mid-wicketDushmantha Chameera, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:18.5 Ashwin to T Perera, wide, out Stumped!! Perera swings, swings and then falls to the floor and is stumped. Looked comical that piece of action but it is actually very well bowled by Ashwin. Once again drawing Perera out of the crease, throwing it miles outside off, beating the antics of Perera and then MS has the easiest job in the world. Ashwin is ready to trade a wide for the wicket of the dangerous Perera. Wait - hang on, replay is in and Perera may have actually made his way back in. Or is the bat in the air. Will update once I see one more replay. It all looked so out, that they didn't bother to check upstairs. The final word on this is still not out. Yes - Perera made it as he slid his bat back in when MS whipped the bails off and the square leg umpire raised the finger immediately. Should've referred that upstairs. Perera is unlucky. Poor umpiring. T Perera st Dhoni b Ashwin 17(6) [4s-2 6s-1]Ashwin to T Perera, THAT'S OUT!! Stumped!!
SRI LANKA:18.4 Ashwin to Kulasekara, leg byes, 1 run, spinning down leg, Kulasekara sweeps and misses. Appeal for lbw, but that was going down
SRI LANKA:18.3 Ashwin to T Perera, 1 run, that's Ashwin's class to the fore. Bowls it well outside off, knows Perera will come down and slog hard, the batsman does the same thing, but since it came off the toe end, it was sliced as well, falls in no-man's land at deep cover. Fell in between all of the fielders running from everywhere to try and catch that
SRI LANKA:18.2 Ashwin to T Perera, SIX, that's raw power. Pure muscle. Nothing more than that. He was beaten in the flight, after dancing down the track, but still slogged it miles over mid-wicket. What forearms he has, the ball sailed well over the fences. Now what will Ashwin do? Test of his character
SRI LANKA:18.1 Ashwin to Kulasekara, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Kulasekara kneels down and sweeps hard, but finds deep mid-wicket to perfection
SRI LANKA:17.6 Bumrah to Kulasekara, 1 run, short and angling in, cramps Kulasekara for room, chipped in the air, but well wide of mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:17.5 Bumrah to T Perera, 1 run, low full toss, slapped straight to the fielder at long-offNow round the wicket
SRI LANKA:17.4 Bumrah to T Perera, FOUR, now gets another four away, stays back and thumps a pull to the left of deep mid-wicket. Picked the slower short ball and went across the line. Perera is a known big hitter and needs to pull off some more of these for his side to have a total on the board
SRI LANKA:17.3 Bumrah to T Perera, FOUR, fullish and outside off, enough width for Perera to swing his arms. Lofted with lots of power and comfortably beats long-offNuwan Kulasekara, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:17.2 Bumrah to Kapugedera, out Caught by Pandya!! Maybe that sloppiness in the field wasn't bad at all from India's perspective. What a good catch by Pandya at sweeper cover. He seems to have the Midas touch at the moment. It was lofted to his right and the ball was travelling but he ran across and judged it beautifully, taking it over his head with two hands. When Kapugedera hit that, he must have felt that he deserved four, but the athletic ability of Pandya came to the fore. Knew where the ropes were and caught it well. Balanced himself inside despite the momentum threatening to take him over. The one man who could've taken Sri Lanka to a fighting total is gone. Kapugedera c Pandya b Bumrah 30(32) [4s-3]Bumrah to Kapugedera, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:17.1 Bumrah to T Perera, 1 run, yorker on the stumps, dug out back to Bumrah, who should've stopped that. But fumbles and allows the single to be taken. Sloppy stuffThisara Perera, left handed bat, comes to the creaseJasprit Bumrah [3.0-0-16-1] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:16.6 Ashwin to Dasun Shanaka, out Dasun Shanaka Run Out!! That is suicide at its best. Run-out off a free hit. Unbelievable! Really? Shocking stuff. Low full toss, swung straight to the fielder at mid-wicket, no chance of a quick single, the throw came to Ashwin who whipped the bails off, catching a desperate diving Dasun Shanaka short. Even a full-length dive wasn't good enough. Third umpire makes an easy decision. Incredulous really, running yourself out of a free-hit. Sums up Sri Lanka's plight aptly. Dasun Shanaka run out (Rohit/Ashwin) 1(4)Ashwin to Dasun Shanaka, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
SRI LANKA:16.6 Ashwin to Dasun Shanaka, no ball, another carrom ball, flat on the stumps, defended to the right of Ashwin. Called no-ball for overstepping. Tight call and touch and go. Free-hit coming up
SRI LANKA:16.5 Ashwin to Kapugedera, 1 run, flat carrom ball, whipped to deep mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:16.4 Ashwin to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, kneels on one leg and sweeps well, but on the bounce to deep backward square leg
SRI LANKA:16.3 Ashwin to Dasun Shanaka, no run, this one straightens outside off, Dasun Shanaka pushes it back to Ashwin
SRI LANKA:16.2 Ashwin to Kapugedera, 1 run, turning in, Kapugedera goes back and clips to deep mid-wicketDasun Shanaka, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:16.1 Ashwin to Siriwardana, out Caught by Raina!! Siriwardana slogs and finds long-on. It was bowled slower and on the stumps, Siriwardana got forward and swung across the line, didn't get enough power behind the shot and easily held by Raina. Reverse-cupped over his head. End of a nice little cameo. Siriwardana c Raina b Ashwin 22(17) [4s-1 6s-1]Ashwin to Siriwardana, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:15.6 Pandya to Kapugedera, 2 runs, Kapugedera makes room and slaps the length delivery wide of the diving backward point, takes on Kohli at sweeper cover and makes it back. Sharp running
SRI LANKA:15.5 Pandya to Siriwardana, 1 run, length on the stumps, Siriwardana gets forward and clips to mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:15.4 Pandya to Siriwardana, 2 runs, now Kohli has an awkward moment at deep mid-wicket. Overran the ball and slips, but manages to drag it back in. The ball wasn't running away, it bounced and stayed close to his grasp. A pull that isn't timed well enough to go for four or six
SRI LANKA:15.3 Pandya to Kapugedera, 1 run, full toss outside off and Kapugedera gets forward to drive to long-off
SRI LANKA:15.2 Pandya to Kapugedera, 2 runs, lethargic from both Ashwin and more importantly Pandya. The bowler was caught off-guard. Short outside off, not timed to mid-wicket, Ashwin hits direct with Kapugedera well in and the ricochet allows the batsmen to go for the second. Smart from both Kapugedera and Siriwardana, for they sensed that the ball had gone far enough for them to go back
SRI LANKA:15.1 Pandya to Siriwardana, 1 run, length delivery on off, run down to the right of pointHardik Pandya [3.0-0-17-2] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:14.6 Ashwin to Kapugedera, no run, tries to go for the reverse and doesn't make contact. Ashwin bowled it outside off and it went straight on
SRI LANKA:14.5 Ashwin to Kapugedera, no run, fired outside off, it was the carrom ball and spun away, Kapugedera swings and missesNow back over the wicket
SRI LANKA:14.4 Ashwin to Kapugedera, FOUR, muscled by Kapugedera. It was short and dragged down, Kapugedera had come forward and stayed there, blazed it like a Roger Federer inside out forehand. Lots of topspin on that as well and it rocketed wide of long-off. Bottom hand coming into play and the power of Kapugedera to the fore as well
SRI LANKA:14.3 Ashwin to Siriwardana, 1 run, fired in on the pads, flicked to deep backward square leg
SRI LANKA:14.2 Ashwin to Siriwardana, 2 runs, a top edge on the slog sweep and falls right in between short fine and deep backward square. Siriwardana got lucky there and they get two
SRI LANKA:14.1 Ashwin to Siriwardana, no run, tossed up and Siriwardana gets forward to flick, gets an inside edge onto the pad and the ball rolls back down the pitchRavichandran Ashwin [1.0-0-4-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:13.6 Raina to Kapugedera, 2 runs, slogged from the crease, it bounces in front of Jadeja at long-on. Aggressive running gives the batsmen two
SRI LANKA:13.5 Raina to Siriwardana, 1 run, nudged to the right of mid-wicket, easy single
SRI LANKA:13.4 Raina to Siriwardana, no run, uses his feet and pushes it back to Raina
SRI LANKA:13.3 Raina to Kapugedera, 1 run, a thick inside edge on the slog to short fine leg, Bumrah should've thrown it at Raina's end. Instead he shoots at MS' and Siriwardana is easily in. Kapu was struggling but the throw didn't come to his end. A run-out chance gone
SRI LANKA:13.2 Raina to Kapugedera, FOUR, filth from Raina, down leg, freebie for Kapugedera, who swings to the deep backward square leg region, Yuvraj got there but didn't stick his right-hand out to stop it. Maybe he got put off by a bit of bad bounce
SRI LANKA:13.1 Raina to Siriwardana, 1 run, tossed up on middle and leg, Siriwardana gets forward and makes room to drive to long-offSuresh Raina, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:12.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Siriwardana, 1 run, dragged down, stays a bit low, Siriwardana rocks back and pulls to deep square leg, productive over for Sri Lanka - 13 came off it
SRI LANKA:12.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Kapugedera, 1 run, bounced a bit, Kapugedera hangs back and nudges a single to the vacant square leg region
SRI LANKA:12.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Siriwardana, 1 run, now flicks wide of mid-wicket. Sensible stuff
SRI LANKA:12.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Siriwardana, FOUR, now finesse! After raw power last ball. Still very quick from Ravindra Jadeja, that is his undoing, plus he gave width outside off, Siriwardana let it come on and then tapped it late, opening the bat face, gets it past short third inside the ring and then it raced away. That's 10 off 2
SRI LANKA:12.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Siriwardana, SIX, round-armish but very flat outside off, Siriwardana stands and delivers. Thumps it back over Ravindra Jadeja's head. Hit cleanly and all the way. Looks like a good proper striker of the ball. That came out of nowhere
SRI LANKA:12.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Siriwardana, no run, flat but still turns in, Siriwardana hangs back to blockRavindra Jadeja [1.0-0-6-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:11.6 Ashwin to Kapugedera, no run, sliding on with the angle, bit of extra bounce and that is good enough to beat the late dab of KapugederaNow round the wicket to Kapugedera as well
SRI LANKA:11.5 Ashwin to Siriwardana, 1 run, tossed up on leg, Siriwardana gets forward and flicks to deep mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:11.4 Ashwin to Kapugedera, 1 run, fraction short, Kapugedera rocks back to pull and mistimes it to deep mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:11.4 Ashwin to Kapugedera, wide, fired down leg, Kapugedera sweeps and misses
SRI LANKA:11.3 Ashwin to Kapugedera, no run, how close! Very close. Tossed up outside off, dipped under the slog of Kapugedera, bounced over the top of off stump. Pre-meditated and Kapugedera didn't connect
SRI LANKA:11.2 Ashwin to Siriwardana, leg byes, 1 run, down leg, takes the pad and goes behind squareA slip in place for the left-hander
SRI LANKA:11.1 Ashwin to Kapugedera, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Kapugedera gets forward and drives to long-offRavichandran Ashwin, right-arm off break, comes into the attackMilinda Siriwardana, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:10.6 Pandya to Mathews, out Bowled!! And just like that he is gone. Pandya has this happy knack of picking up wickets. He was under pressure all over but has nailed the big wicket off the last ball. It was a length ball outside off, Mathews played with an angled bat, trying to run it down to third man and chopped it back on. Just when he was timing them well, perishes and puts his side back under the pump. Mathews b Pandya 18(19) [4s-3]Pandya to Mathews, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
SRI LANKA:10.5 Pandya to Mathews, FOUR, Mathews is taking a liking to Pandya. Moves outside off and then swings across the line, to a length delivery outside off, well wide of Nehra and the ball scooted away. Looks like Mathews is finding some much needed form and at the right moment for Sri Lanka
SRI LANKA:10.4 Pandya to Kapugedera, 1 run, an awkward moment for Yuvraj at sweeper cover. It was belted straight to him but he slipped and then has a look at the turf, the feet got stuck but he recovered and kept it to a single. Loud thump when ball met bat, pity that it wasn't placed in the gap
SRI LANKA:10.3 Pandya to Kapugedera, no run, dug in short outside off, left alone and the height is good enough not to be called a wide
SRI LANKA:10.2 Pandya to Mathews, 1 run, on the hips, Mathews hops and nudges it to fine leg
SRI LANKA:10.1 Pandya to Mathews, FOUR, Mathews is looking to take some risks and this one has paid off. Charges Pandya and belts it across the line, the ball bounced in front of mid-on and sped away past the hands. Didn't get the body behind the line of the ball and that is elementary when you are trying to fiel
SRI LANKA:9.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Kapugedera, no run, on the stumps, driven to cover
SRI LANKA:9.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Mathews, 1 run, flicked wide of mid-wicket for a single. Hesitation between the two, but it was in the gap
SRI LANKA:9.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Mathews, FOUR, that is a fine shot. Makes room and goes straight. Saw the flight and tonked it back over Ravindra Jadeja's head. One bounce and over
SRI LANKA:9.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Mathews, no run, now gets lucky. Flighted on middle, turned across Mathews, who was flicking to leg, the leading edge is found, but wide of slip and backward point is there in business again. Risky ploy against Ravindra Jadeja when the ball is turning
SRI LANKA:9.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Mathews, no run, hint of turn. Mathews is lured into the forward push, the ball dips in front of the bat and takes the soft edge, rolls to backward point. Mathews took the bottom hand off the bat after playing that. Looked surprised by that suddenly turning
SRI LANKA:9.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Kapugedera, 1 run, flat on off, punched off the back foot to sweeper coverRavindra Jadeja, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:8.6 Pandya to Mathews, no run, almost squared up. Lovely full length on off and middle, Mathews is early into the flick but the thick leading edge rolls back to Pandya
SRI LANKA:8.5 Pandya to Mathews, no run, nervy poke from Mathews and nearly another one for Pandya. Length delivery outside off, Mathews looked to run it down and is lucky that he didn't nick it. Another very low percentage shot. Low percentage because he wasn't trying to stay beside the line of the ball while playing it, behind it in fact
SRI LANKA:8.4 Pandya to Kapugedera, 1 run, short on the stumps, not head high like to Dilshan, more hip high and pulled straight to the fielder at deep backward square leg
SRI LANKA:8.3 Pandya to Kapugedera, no run, now this one bounces extra and spoils his attempt at an encore. Dabbed to point and sent back by Mathews
SRI LANKA:8.2 Pandya to Kapugedera, FOUR, finally Kapugedera gets something to cheer himself up. Beautifully played despite a slip being there. Length outside off, allowed the ball to come to him and then opened the bat face to run it down, wide of slip and beats third man comfortably. Since he played it so late, the ball sped away to the boundary
SRI LANKA:8.1 Pandya to Mathews, 1 run, length on off and middle, tucked to deep square leg
SRI LANKA:7.6 Yuvraj to Kapugedera, no run, a big slog to leg. Onto the boot and the ball dribbles back down the pitch. Kapugedera eyed the flight and tried to muscle a big shot across the line, but he is desperately out of touch and it is showing
SRI LANKA:7.5 Yuvraj to Mathews, 1 run, that should've been stopped. Yuvraj went down in instalments there, showing his age. It was pushed to his left and he couldn't stop the single
SRI LANKA:7.4 Yuvraj to Kapugedera, 1 run, tossed up outside off, driven to sweeper cover, only a single
SRI LANKA:7.3 Yuvraj to Kapugedera, no run, wild from Kapugedera. This was the moon ball from Yuvraj, cleverly bowled outside off too, it hung in the air for a long while, drew the big stroke from Kapugedera and spun away to beat the edge
SRI LANKA:7.2 Yuvraj to Mathews, 1 run, loopy outside off, Mathews gets forward to drive and mistimes it to long-offA slip in place
SRI LANKA:7.1 Yuvraj to Mathews, no run, shortish outside off, kept low and went under the bottom edge of Mathews as he looked to cutYuvraj Singh, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:6.6 Pandya to Mathews, 1 run, now comes down the track and tries to do something, but the length is pulled back, Mathews adjusts and steers it down to third man
SRI LANKA:6.5 Pandya to Mathews, no run, pitched up outside off, Mathews drives and gets it off the thickish outer half, Jadeja moves to his right at point and they aren't going to take a chance on his arm
SRI LANKA:6.4 Pandya to Mathews, no run, short of length on the stumps, defended back down the track
SRI LANKA:6.3 Pandya to Mathews, no run, what was that from Mathews? Terrible call from the captain and he immediately puts his hand up to Kapugedera to apologise. That would've been curtains had Pandya hit at the non-striker's end. How quick is Pandya on his followthrough? Looks like a tremendous athlete. It was tapped to his left, he rushed forward, picked the ball up, turned around and shied, unfortunately missed. Kapugedera had given up. A run-out chance missed, but if the wicket had happened, it would've been all down to the brilliance of PandyaTwo slips in place
SRI LANKA:6.2 Pandya to Mathews, no run, full outside off, driven off the front foot but straight to the fielder at coverAngelo Mathews, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:6.1 Pandya to Dilshan, out Caught by Ashwin!! Pandya has struck first ball. Where is the Brett Lee heel click? I didn't see that. Good pacy bouncer on the stumps, Dilshan swivelled on the hook and found Ashwin at fine leg with a top edge. Just a stroll to his right and cupped with both hands. As easy as it comes. Dilshan's struggle comes to an end. He has looked a pale shadow of his former self and time is running out for him. Once again Sri Lanka find themselves in familiar trouble. Enter Mathews - their eternal savior! Dilshan c Ashwin b Pandya 18(16) [4s-2]Pandya to Dilshan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Hardik Pandya, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:5.6 Bumrah to Kapugedera, no run, excellent yorker. Just that it was not in line with the stumps. If it was, Kapugedera would've found it difficult to keep that out. Tailed back in late and just missed the bat as Kapugedera sought to dig it out. Kapugedera's bat came down at an angle and even though he slammed the bat hard into the ground, no contact was made. Bumrah continues to impress
SRI LANKA:5.5 Bumrah to Dilshan, 1 run, angling in, Dilshan wrists it to deep backward square leg, for a single
SRI LANKA:5.4 Bumrah to Kapugedera, 1 run, back of a length on the stumps, cramps Kapugedera for room, he dabs to Jadeja at point and both batsmen have judged that quick single well
SRI LANKA:5.3 Bumrah to Dilshan, 1 run, low full toss on the stumps, Dilshan is early into the flick, a leading edge is found, but luckily the ball falls well in front of the fielder at mid-on
SRI LANKA:5.2 Bumrah to Dilshan, 2 runs, yorker on off, flicked through mid-wicket and they take on the fielder in the deep and come back for the second. Good aggressive running
SRI LANKA:5.1 Bumrah to Dilshan, FOUR, Dilshan swivels and pulls the short ball to fine leg. Dhawan covered good ground and dived, but allowed the ball to escape. Should've stopped that, gives away four. The ball was travelling but once he got there, he should've stopped the ball
SRI LANKA:4.6 Nehra to Dilshan, 1 run, length outside off, short-arm jabbed wide of mid-on, Dilshan retains the strike with that run
SRI LANKA:4.5 Nehra to Kapugedera, leg byes, 3 runs, Nehra learns from his previous appeal. This one is a proper "howzaatttt" running backwards and must say he is unlucky not to get Kapugedera out. The umpire has got that wrong. Pitched in-line and missed the defence of Kapugedera, would've gone onto hit the leg stump. But maybe the umpire assumed that the over the wicket line from Nehra would have meant that the ball pitched outside leg. It didn't and Kapugedera is lucky to stay there. Raina shies at the stumps and with Kapugedera in the crease, there is no-one backing up and they take three runs. That was a wasted throw by Raina
SRI LANKA:4.4 Nehra to Dilshan, 1 run, now pushes a length ball in front of mid-on, and takes the single on offer
SRI LANKA:4.3 Nehra to Dilshan, no run, Nehra goes "aaahhhhhhh" with his mouth wide so open, that there was a big danger of flies having a field day, if only flies were there on the field. It was full and just around the fourth stump line, Dilshan made sure he got outside the line of off in trying to sweep, missed the shot, but ensured the impact was not in line with the stumps. Nehra's gaping appeal is turned down and rightly so by the umpire. Close call but no cigar!
SRI LANKA:4.3 Nehra to Dilshan, wide, pacy delivery, but down leg, Dilshan flicks and misses
SRI LANKA:4.2 Nehra to Dilshan, no run, tight delivery on the stumps, Dilshan gets forward and pushes it to mid-off
SRI LANKA:4.2 Nehra to Dilshan, wide, slips the slower delivery down leg
SRI LANKA:4.1 Nehra to Dilshan, no run, length outside off, driven back to Nehra
SRI LANKA:3.6 Bumrah to Kapugedera, no run, and again he beats Kapugedera. Nothing shot from Kapugedera. Tries to steer a ball outside off and is beaten. Would've got just one for that, not sure what he was trying to do there. Very low percentage shot when the ball is moving
SRI LANKA:3.5 Bumrah to Kapugedera, no run, lovely delivery to beat Kapugedera. It angled in and then straightnened past the leaden-footed poke of the batsman. Nice delivery in the corridor of uncertainty and Kapugedera's feet went nowhere, so lucky not to edge thatChamara Kapugedera, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:3.4 Bumrah to Jayasuriya, out Caught by Dhoni!! It all happened in slow motion there. A clear edge and MS didn't go up immediately. But the bowler sensed the sound and went up half-heartedly. But the umpire was the only man who was sure, raised his finger in a jiffy. It was on a back of a length and on the fourth stump line, Jayasuriya in trying to punch, got a nick which was audible on TV. So it is the turn of Bumrah to strike now. Another failure for Jayasuriya. Another look at the replay and it is the batsman who walked, then the umpire raised his finger. Wonder what would've happened had Jayasuriya waited for the umpire to make his call. Jayasuriya c Dhoni b Bumrah 3(5)Bumrah to Jayasuriya, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:3.3 Bumrah to Dilshan, 1 run, on the hips, Dilshan gets a thin inside edge onto the pad, lobs in no-man's land at short fine. MS had to do the chasing and did so, but he had no chance of catching that
SRI LANKA:3.2 Bumrah to Dilshan, FOUR, there comes the Dilscoop! Not well connected but gets four. Shuffled outside off and got a bit of glove/the splice of the bat, on the shot. It was taken from outside off and once he got the ball past the right of the diving short fine, it was always four. Looking back, Dilshan didn't go for the authentic version of the scoop, sort of a paddle that one
SRI LANKA:3.1 Bumrah to Jayasuriya, 1 run, angled in on the stumps, pushed to mid-on, the fielder is on his heels a bit and a quick single is taken easilyNow Bumrah is round the wicket
SRI LANKA:2.6 Nehra to Jayasuriya, 1 run, the pace off the shot is taken off by Nehra in his followthrough, Jayasuriya charged the bowler and hit it hard, but Nehra stuck his right-hand out and intercepted the drive. Still the batsmen manage a single
SRI LANKA:2.5 Nehra to Jayasuriya, no run, short of length outside off, punched without any timing to mid-off
SRI LANKA:2.4 Nehra to Dilshan, 1 run, full on the pads, flicked to deep square leg
SRI LANKA:2.3 Nehra to Jayasuriya, 1 run, punched in front of mid-off and a quick single taken, Jayasuriya is off the mark first ball. Well-judged tooShehan Jayasuriya, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:2.2 Nehra to Chandimal, out Caught by Dhoni!! The pressure gets to Chandimal and he goes. Nehra takes off his aeroplane. Very subdued version of Shoaib Akhtar if one may call it. This was a good ball, seeing Chandimal charge, he cleverly bowled it following the batsman, Chandimal swung and the inside edge was found. Easy take for MS behind the stumps. The runs weren't coming and Chandimal felt he had to do something to get out of the tight hold. The persevering Nehra gets his reward. The umpire had his finger up in a flash. Chandimal c Dhoni b Nehra 4(11) [4s-1]Nehra to Chandimal, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:2.1 Nehra to Dilshan, 1 run, good stop by Ashwin at short fine. Saved three. Flicked to his left and he moved swiftly and made a one-handed stop to his left. The ball was travelling and the effort from Ashwin is appreciated in a truly Nehra way. Can't make out what he was gesturing there, just grimaced and pointed his hand, trying to clap
SRI LANKA:1.6 Bumrah to Chandimal, no run, now raps Chandimal on the thigh pad. This one nipped back in with extra bounce, Chandimal was on the hop trying to flick and missed
SRI LANKA:1.5 Bumrah to Chandimal, no run, now is beaten again outside off. Walks forward and tries to drive on the rise, the ball passes the bat and then bounces low through to Mahendra Singh Dhoni. A sort of walking stroke from Chandimal and enough straightening there to beat the bat
SRI LANKA:1.4 Bumrah to Chandimal, no run, not short to flash away and Chandimal is beaten on the late cut. Cramped him for room on the shot and despite arching his back to steer it late, saw the ball fly over the outside edge, not far from taking a feather
SRI LANKA:1.3 Bumrah to Chandimal, no run, yorker on fourth stump, Chandimal digs it out to cover
SRI LANKA:1.2 Bumrah to Dilshan, 1 run, one ball is all Dilshan needs to do something out of the ordinary. Shuffles across outside off and tries to muscle a length ball over mid-wicket, the extra pace and nip of Bumrah cramps him up and the ball rolls wide of mid-wicket off the splice of the bat. Very awkwardly played by Dilshan. He took a step out of the crease to manufacture a boundary, but his balance was all shot thereJust a lone slip for Bumrah
SRI LANKA:1.1 Bumrah to Dilshan, no run, back of a length around the fourth stump line, Dilshan completely mistimes the back foot punch, sliced without any power to point. Went too hard at it and it nipped back in enough to cramp him upJasprit Bumrah, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:0.6 Nehra to Chandimal, no run, full around off, pressed off the front foot to cover
SRI LANKA:0.5 Nehra to Chandimal, no run, Nehra goes up for a big appeal for lbw. Clear inside edge onto the pad. Nehra didn't know that, went up in a huge way, Rohit Sharma grimaces from slip. He picked the inside edge, it swung back in again, on off, Chandimal went for a big drive and there was a slight gap between bat and pad, but luckily the edge saved him as it cannoned into the pad
SRI LANKA:0.4 Nehra to Chandimal, no run, Nehra pulls his length back, short of length on off, defended solidly to cover
SRI LANKA:0.3 Nehra to Chandimal, no run, pitches it full on off, Chandimal drives with an open face, to the left of cover. Slight fumble but they don't risk the single as point is there to cover
SRI LANKA:0.2 Nehra to Chandimal, FOUR, top shot to get off the mark. Hint of width outside off, full and wide and Chandimal lashes out. On the rise and wide of mid-off. Hit in the air but nowhere near catching range. A very fine blow by Chandimal to get himself a boundary. Slight error from Nehra and that was good enough for Chandimal
SRI LANKA:0.1 Nehra to Chandimal, no run, lovely swinging delivery first up from Nehra, well played by Chandimal too. Didn't fall over on the flick, neither did he get his front foot too far across, played it with a straight bat and dug it out to mid-on. But that should encourage NehraChandimal and Dilshan are at the crease. Chandimal is on strike. Nehra will open the attackThe players are walking out to the middle. Chandimal and Dilshan are the Sri Lankan openers. Looks like Dilshan has a brand new willow in his hand. It is gleaming under the lights. Chandimal will take strike. A slip and a sort of third slip for Nehra as the countdown begins. Kohli sees himself on the screen and has a smile. All set to goTeams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Dinesh Chandimal(w), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Shehan Jayasuriya, Angelo Mathews(c), Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dushmantha Chameera, Rangana HerathIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Ashish NehraMathews: "The pitch might seam a little bit early on and we wanted to bowl first because of the dew factor. We have got to fire with the bat to win, hopefully the boys will click. We are coming as the underdogs and we've got nothing to lose. We are trying to settle down as a team and hopefully we will settle down before the World Cup. We are unchanged for this game."Dhoni: "We will bowl first. We'll have to wait and see how the pitch behaves. Probably this one has slightly less grass and it is slightly harder as well. The preparation for us has been very good. It lets us get into the groove. Gives us an opportunity to try out a few things before the World Cup. We have made one change. Shikhar Dhawan comes back in place of Ajinkya Rahane."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: "This is the same pitch where India played Pakistan. We've got a little bit of grass, but there are a few cracks as well. This is a good pitch for a T20 game," reckons Dean Jones.From the Lankan camp, Angelo Mathews, Rangana Herath and coach, Graham Ford, were seen having a discussion around the pitch. Lasith Malinga is with the team physio as he's doing some warm-ups. Not sure if he will play though. I can see Malinga in the middle of a team catching session. Dean Jones, on TV, though feels that Malinga might well be ruled out of the tournament. He can't see him playing with a badly injured left knee.Team News: Our man, Ganesh Chandrasekaran, is at the ground and he has spotted Rohit Sharma facing a few throwdowns with Ravi Shastri and the team physio, Patrick Farhart. Remember, he was struck on his boot by a searing yorker from Mohammad Amir in the match against Pakistan. Shastri has also had a little chat with his opener after the brief session. On the other hand, Shikhar Dhawan, who missed the Pakistan match with a slight niggle, is also wandering around - although he doesn't look comfortable.Problems persist in the Sri Lankan camp. They might be missing their skipper, Lasith Malinga, from today's match as well. The 32-year old speedster has been hampered with a left knee injury and is said to be a doubtful starter. Adding to their woes is the poor form of experienced opener, Tillakaratne Dilshan. Stand-in skipper, Angelo Mathews, is only coming back after a lay-off himself and the rest of the team hasn't gelled well as a unit so far. The team is missing their stars, but it also gives the youngsters an opportunity to prove their potential. The World Cup is a fortnight away and time is running out for the management to find their best possible eleven.India have looked sharp and have been the team to beat so far. They have played on strips that have been bowlers' paradises. Even then, they have often found heroes - both with the bat as well as the ball. If Rohit Sharma sparkled against Bangladesh, it was the turn of Virat Kohli to turn saviour against Pakistan. While the batting has held firm, the bowlers have been more than impressive. Ashish Nehra continues to be the leader of the pack, Jasprit Bumrah, remains impressive but the emergence of Hardik Pandya should gladden Indian hearts. His all-round abilities have provided the much needed balance for MS Dhoni - allowing the skipper to play two frontline spinners, even on green tracks. Overall, India looks like a cracking unit and will be rearing for more success.18:10 Local Time, 12:10 GMT, 17:40 IST:: The Asia Cup is nearing its business end and the tussle for a place in the final is hotting up. With two wins from two matches, India are in pole position and will all but confirm their place in the final - if they are to win tonight. On the other hand, Sri Lanka haven't quite turned up as yet and are in desperate need of a victory - not just to keep themselves alive in the tournament, but also to lift their sagging spirits, after having lost to Bangladesh in their previous encounter. The two teams recently featured in a 3-match T20I series, with India winning 2-1. Form predicts an easy Indian victory today, but T20I is more than just about form. Can Sri Lanka burst India's bubble and keep themselves in contention? Hello and a warm welcome to Match 7 of the 2016 edition of the Asia Cup.Preview by Ganesh ChandrasekaranInjuries and pitch conditions are amongst the primary focus a day ahead of India's match against Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup on Tuesday (March 1). Both teams will be hampered with injuries to key players and might feel the sting of not playing their best eleven. For Sri Lanka, it is a must-win game. They will now have to beat both India and Pakistan to stand a chance to qualify for the final. The fitness of regular skipper Lasith Malinga will be their biggest concern ahead of the important clash.Malinga missed their previous game against Bangladesh due to a niggle in the knee. The game before that, against UAE, was his first game in three months and he pulled up sore after picking up a match-winning four-wicket haul. Angelo Mathews, stand-in skipper, was unsure about Malinga's availability for the rest of the tournament and the Lankans will not rest easy if the pacer does pull out of the game against India.MS Dhoni and Co. have their own set of worries as well. The skipper himself is playing through this tournament with a back brace, despite spasms. There is a back-up option of Parthiv Patel but it looks likely that Parthiv might step in for one of the regular openers in this game. Both Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan are nursing injuries.Rohit suffered a blow on his left toe, which forced him to go for scans. Although the scans did not reveal a crack, Rohit did not take part in the training session ahead of the game against Sri Lanka. Dhawan, who missed the game against Pakistan due to an injury to his left heel, was seen wearing a bandage but still managed to do a few fitness drills before going out to have a hit. If both of them miss out, then it will force the team to make a few changes right from the top.A straightforward move could be to draft in Parthiv as an opener but Team India will also consider the option of pushing Kohli to open and drafting in Pawan Negi to bolster the batting in the lower-middle order.The pitches that have been provided so far in Dhaka have all aided the seamers to a large extent. The last time India faced Sri Lanka on a green-top in Pune, their batting crumbled against a young Sri Lankan pace attack. This time around the islanders have a more potent new-ball bowlers in Nuwan Kulasekara and Angelo Mathews but India's batting has also shown a marked improvement in such conditions. With Kohli and Rohit showing the technical nous to shore up the batting in similar conditions, it does appear that India have that front sorted.The same cannot be said about Sri Lanka though. Their batting came a cropper twice in succession. With the exception of Dinesh Chandimal, none of the others have shown an inclination to stick around and milk runs, as Mathews conceded. Chandimal himself was guilty of throwing away a good start against Bangladesh.But Sri Lanka still possess a line-up that bats very deep. They will be banking on the others to come good soon enough. Tillakaratne Dilshan will be under focus. In the absence of experience down the order, the pressure on the senior opener to deliver becomes even more acute. He hasn't found his touch so far and he'd do well to pace his innings better. Sri Lanka will need him to set up the ideal base for the power-hitters down the order like Thisara Perera and Dasun Sanaka to capitalise.India need another win to put them in pole position to grab a spot in the final. Form isn't a concern for Dhoni's men but man-management will be critical in the build-up to the World T20. They will tread carefully before taking a call on fielding players with niggles with the big tournament following soon after. It will be interesting to see how they tackle this tricky situation.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Dinesh Chandimal(w), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Shehan Jayasuriya, Angelo Mathews, Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Dasun Shanaka, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dushmantha Chameera, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga(c), Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Jeffrey Vandersay, Niroshan DickwellaIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Ashish Nehra, Ajinkya Rahane, Harbhajan Singh, Pawan Negi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Parthiv PatelLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
