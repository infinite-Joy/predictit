Bradley Wheal will open the attackTeams:Afghanistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Shahzad(w), Noor Ali Zadran, Javed Ahmadi, Rahmat Shah, Asghar Stanikzai(c), Najibullah Zadran, Mirwais Ashraf, Mohammad Nabi, Shapoor Zadran, Rashid Khan, Dawlat ZadranScotland (Playing XI): Preston Mommsen(c), Kyle Coetzer, Craig Wallace, Matthew Cross(w), Richie Berrington, Con de Lange, Bradley Wheal, Safyaan Sharif, Alasdair Evans, Ruaidhri Smith, Michael LeaskAfghanistan have won the toss and have opted to batWe look absolutely set for an on-time start, with clear blue skies to greet us. The toss and team compositions shortly..Having been deprived of a full game a couple of days ago, both teams would be looking to make amends in this second installment. Starved of international cricket against the full members, both these associates would be highly motivated to make the most of this opportunity to stake claim for a berth at the proposed 10-team World Cup in 2019. The visitors would be on a high after a splendid century from the crafty Rahmat Shah and the supreme power hitting by Najibullah Zadran. They looked well on course to post a daunting total on the board before the skies opened up forcing the authorities to call off the game. The Scottish on the other hand would be looking to tighten up their screws and put up an improved performance in familiar conditions.  Preview: It was a special day for Rahmat Shah, Afghanistan's all-rounder, who scored his maiden One-Day International century against Scotland on Monday (July 4) at the Grange Cricket Club in Edinburgh. Coming in at No.4, the right-hander crafted a beautifully-paced century that came off 123 balls, comprising eight fours and a six. It was a vital innings - one that Afghanistan needed after losing both openers within eight overs in the first of two One-Day Internationals (ODI).Rahmat held the innings together while wickets fell at the other end. In the end, however, it was him and Najibullah Zadran who came together to stitch an unbeaten 157-run record stand for the fifth wicket to take their side to 283 for 4 in 47.2 overs when rain came pelting down incessantly and the game was called off. This was Scotland's first ODI at home in over two years.If Rahmat's innings was worthy of praise for being the anchor, it was Najibullah's that gave Afghanistan the impetus as the 23-year-old took on Scotland's attack and tore it apart. He scored his third ODI half-century and remained unbeaten on 89 off 53. The carnage was apparent as he belted nine fours and five sixes during his stay.Con de Lange was the only Scottish bowler who conceded less than four runs an over in the seven that he bowled; the five others conceded close to six. Bradley Wheal, who plies his trade with Hampshire, impressed on his return to the side after his debut in January with two wickets. Alasdair Evans, who got rid of Mohammad Shahzad at the top, leaked runs on the day, conceding 73 runs in his 10 overs.When the two sides face-off for the final ODI on Wednesday (July 6), they would hope rain doesn't play spoilsport again, as this series provides a warm-up for Afghanistan, who are due to tour Ireland for a five-match ODI series. Scotland, too, would have recognised the need for their bowlers to shrug off the rust and batsmen to get a hit out ahead of their Intercontinental game against United Arab Emirates slotted for August 9.When: Scotland vs Afghanistan, 2nd ODI, 10:45 local time (3:15 pm IST).Where: Grange Cricket Club, EdinburghWhat to expect: With the first game washed out, the signs are slightly more promising for the second ODI with a better forecast.Teams:Afghanistan (From): Mohammad Shahzad(w), Noor Ali Zadran, Javed Ahmadi, Rahmat Shah, Asghar Stanikzai(c), Najibullah Zadran, Mirwais Ashraf, Mohammad Nabi, Dawlat Zadran, Rashid Khan, Hamid Hassan, Samiullah Shenwari, Shapoor Zadran, Amir Hamza, Yamin Ahmadzai, Nasir Jamal, Imran Janat, Afsar Zazai, Gulbadin NaibScotland (From): Kyle Coetzer, Craig Wallace, Matthew Cross(w), Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Con de Lange, Michael Leask, Safyaan Sharif, Ruaidhri Smith, Alasdair Evans, Bradley Wheal, Mark Watt, Calum MacLeodLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
