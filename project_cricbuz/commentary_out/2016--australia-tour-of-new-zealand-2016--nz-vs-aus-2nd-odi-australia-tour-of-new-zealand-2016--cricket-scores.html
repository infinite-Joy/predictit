By the way, Usman Khawaja is back as wellNew Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batWe can confirm one debutant for Australia. Adam Zampa has been handed his cap by legendary Australian captain, Allan Border. Will Steve Smith make any further changes? We will get to know in a short while..Hello, and a warm welcome to the second Ond Day Internatyional between New Zealand and Australia. We are at Cake Tin, Wellington, as the hosts looks to seal the series, after their emphatic victory at Eden Park, three days ago. On the other hand, the injury ravaged Australians will be hoping for some good luck - especially after being hammered in the first match. Brendon McCullum's swansong will continue - this will be the New Zealand captain's last international game on this ground. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates..Preview:After losing their last five international games on the trot, world champions Australia are under tremendous pressure to pull one back in the second One-Day International (ODI) against New Zealand at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington, on Saturday (February 6). Should Australia lose their sixth consecutive game, the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy will have an outright winner in the form of New Zealand, courtesy their 159-run win in the first game two days ago.Australia's batting line-up is under huge pressure to deliver after they succumbed easily to Trent Boult and Matt Henry in under 25 overs. The collapse is a huge cause for concern considering something similar happened 12 months ago when the two team clashed in their ICC Cricket World Cup group game.The selectors have done the right thing by including Usman Khawaja, the one who is believed to be the best Australian batsman on current form. He will replace Shaun Marsh at the top and leg-spinner Adam Zampa will be making his debut in James Faulkner's place after the all-rounder was ruled out of the tour following a hamstring injury in Auckland.David Warner, who seemed to disagree with George Bailey on his leg-before wicket referral in the first ODI, and Steven Smith will have to step up. The duo left Australia early in order to prepare for this series but failed to deliver.The bowling looked flat as well in Mitchell Starc's absence. Hastings is the senior-most bowler in the setup and will be expected to deliver.Coach Darren Lehmann is all set to fly out to New Zealand and reunite with the team on the day of the second match, and that should give the squad some confidence.New Zealand, on the other hand, have not announced their playing XI but are unlikely to fiddle with their winning combination. They have not defeated Australia in a bilateral series since 2007 but the odds are in their favour to set the record straight this time. The hosts boast of a formidable record at this venue having won 11 out of their last 14 matches here with their previous loss coming against Australia in 2005.Last year in the World Cup at the same venue, the home side put up two dominating displays. In the first game, they bundled out England for just 123 with Tim Southee claiming a seven-wicket haul. The next was the quarterfinal against West Indies where Martin Guptill scored a majestic 237.Australia will be wary of the threat he possesses given his recent form. His opening partner Brendon McCullum will be playing his penultimate ODI match. McCullum gave the hosts a typical start in the previous game and he will looking for more of the same.Teams:Australia (From): David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), John Hastings, Adam Zampa, Kane Richardson, Scott Boland, Josh Hazlewood, Shaun MarshNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Henry Nicholls, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell, Colin MunroLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
