The hosts were motoring on Tamim and Anamul's 158-run opening wicket partnership till the 32nd over. They lost their way after Tamim and Shakib were dismissed off successive deliveries. Then, Panyangara dismissed Anamul and Sabbir in an over to trouble the hosts further.

All the Zimbabwean bowlers bowled well and got in the wickets column except Nyumbu. Can Bangladesh defend this total or will Zimbabwe come out on top to level the series tonight?

BANGLADESH:0.1 Panyangara to Tamim, no run, fullish and in the channel outside off to start off, left aloneTamim and Anamul are at the crease. Tamim is on strike.

They bowled well initially but completely lost the plot in the death overs. Their batsmen did well in patches but succumbed to Bangladesh's formidable spin attack. With four more matches to go, they have a good opportunity today to square the series. Will they be able to challenge the hosts? Or, will Bangladesh continue to stay ahead? Hello and welcome to the second ODI being played at Chittagong. Toss, teams and all the answers coming up shortly....Bangladesh have been in terrific form since last few weeks. They were sensational in the Test series effecting a 3-0 clean sweep againt Zimbabwe and started off the ODI series with their first victory of 2014. After being put to bat, they survived a top-order collapse and posted a competitive 281 on the board. They backed this up with an equally brilliant bowling performance. Shakib was the Man of the Match for his fantastic ton and picking up 4 crucial wickets.Preview:Following the 3-0 clean-sweep of the Test series, a fine all-round performance gave Bangladesh a 1-0 lead in the ODI series against Zimbabwe and it also helped them register their first ever ODI win in 2014. The hosts will look to extend their winning streak against the African side when they face off in the second one-dayer at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong.Bangladesh:While they won the first ODI by a comfortable fashion, there were a few jitters as far as the hosts' batting was concerned. A top-order collapse left them in a spot of bother before Shakib Al Hasan hit a superb ton and put on a record 5th wicket stand with Mushfiqur Rahim to help Bangladesh recover. Even after that, the hosts lost a few wickets in the death overs and a strong total would not have been possible if debutant Sabbir Rahman had not come up with a blitzy 44 off just 25 balls. The start and the finish is something the Bangladesh batting needs to work on. Tamim Iqbal and Anamul Haque fell cheaply in the first game and they will be eager to make an impact. Mominul Haque got out after a promising start while Mahmudullah did not contribute much. If the top four can provide a good start, it will be an added cushion, considering that two of their most experienced players - Shakib and Mushfiqur, can provide the ideal finish.Shakib was the also the star with the ball as he picked up a four-wicket haul, making him only the 12th cricketer to score a ton and pick up a four-fer in the same ODI. Mashrafe Mortaza, Arafat Sunny and Mahmudullah provided the left-handed all-rounder good support as they picked up two wickets apiece while keeping things tight at their end. The hosts will be hoping that the bowlers can come up with a similar performance in the 2nd match while they will expect Al-Amin Hossain - who turned out to be expensive in the two overs that he bowled - to pull up his socks.Zimbabwe:Zimbabwe batsmen have always flattered to deceive, which was the same case in the opening match. Hamilton Masakadza and Sikandar Raza provided them a good start, but the visitors lost their way as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Brendan Taylor tried to stem the rot with a fighting half-century, but Zimbabwe failed to come up with any answers against the spin test, losing the game by 87 runs. ODI skipper, Elton Chigumbura will be hoping that the top order, consisting of Masakadza, Raza, Vusi Sibanda and Taylor, score the bulk of the runs and bat with a lot more application against the slow bowlers. The captain himself will be eager to make a contribution with the bat while Regis Chakabva, who did well in the Test series, will be keen to make an impression in the one-dayers.Tinashe Panyangara did well in the first match, picking up three wickets, but he also gave away a few, especially at the death. The likes of Tendai Chatara, Chigumbura and Tafadzwa Kamungozi kept things tight, but Bangladesh's late onslaught meant that their figures took a bit of a dent. To add to that, Zimbabwe conceded quite a few extras - 15 wides and 2 no-balls - which meant almost three extra overs for Bangladesh apart from the bonus runs. The visiting team, who will be keen to square the series, need to come up with a more disciplined performance with ball.Team News:Bangladesh are likely to field the same eleven that won the opening match. As far as Zimbabwe's team is concerned, Vusi Sibanda has been struggling for form and they might think of replacing him.Pitch and Conditions:The pitch is expected to help the batsmen while there will be something on offer for the slow bowlers as well. The fact that the remaining matches have been advanced by an hour means that the dew factor will not have much of an impact.Numbers:4: The number of wickets Elton Chigumbura needs to take to reach the mark of 100 ODI wickets.36: The number of runs Elton Chigumbura requires to reach the mark of 1000 ODI runs against Bangladesh.60: The number of runs Tamim Iqbal needs to reach the mark of 1000 ODI runs against Zimbabwe.Quotes:We have to stop relying on one guy. We have to get out of this mentality. Everyone has to try and contribute: Bangladesh captain, Mashrafe Mortaza.It's always tough to play in Bangladesh, but there are still four more games to play. We need to bounce back as a team: Zimbabwe skipper, Elton Chigumbura.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Hamilton Masakadza, Sikandar Raza, Vusi Sibanda, Brendan Taylor, Regis Chakabva(w), Elton Chigumbura(c), Solomon Mire, Tinashe Panyangara, John Nyumbu, Tendai Chatara, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Natsai Mushangwe, Neville Madziva, Tawanda Mupariwa, Craig Ervine, Richmond Mutumbami, Malcolm Waller, Timycen Maruma, Peter Moor, Brian VitoriBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Arafat Sunny, Al-Amin Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Jubair Hossain, Imrul KayesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
