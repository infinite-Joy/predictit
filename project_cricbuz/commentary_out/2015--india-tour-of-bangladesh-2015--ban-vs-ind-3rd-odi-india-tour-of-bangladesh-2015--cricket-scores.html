Tamim is on strike. Binny will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Binny will open with one slip and a gully in placeDhawan: 'It was hardwork out there. The pitch is nice but the weather is very humid. It can get very tough in the middle as the body gets tired quickly. He (Mustafizur) has been bowling really well and that's why he got 13 wickets in this series. These sort of wickets also suit his variations. It is a normal wicket and we have got good fast bowlers. Now, we can put them under pressure and hopefully, we can defend this.'Dhoni too made his presence felt with a crunching knock. He hasn't exactly been at his best in recent times, but today, he played his natural game. In the slog overs though, he struggled with the hot and humid conditions. Suresh Raina also played a quick-fire cameo and that helped India to up the ante. He muscled away fine strokes through the mid-wicket region. For Bangladesh, Mashrafe Mortaza picked up three wickets, but was expensive. Mustafizur Rahman, the hero of Bangladesh in the first two encounters, snaffled two scalps. The youngster also excelled in the field by pouching a good catch in the deep to send Dhoni back to the pavilion. The batsmen have given the visitors the chance to end the series with a consolation win. Shikhar Dhawan and MS Dhoni composed crucial half-centuries to take India to a massive total. This was the first time they have amassed more than 300 runs in this series. After putting up disastrous performances in the first two games, the batsmen gave a better account of themselves in the final match. Despite the visitors losing Rohit Sharma relatively early on in the innings, Dhawan kept the scorecard moving. 4

The youngster, Mustafizur Rahman has the new ball, two slips and a gully in place, floodlights are on as wellTeams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das(w), Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Mustafizur RahmanIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Stuart Binny, Axar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Dhawal Kulkarni, Umesh YadavDhoni: 'We were looking to bowl first as well. We thought if it rains, the spinners would find it hard to bowl later. It is a big disappointment for us, otherwise we have had a good season. Our performance has been really good overall this season. The busy schedule has taken a lot off the guys. You want to do well in the ICC tournaments. You feel bad whenever you lose a series where you are expected to do well. Hopefully, the guys can do well today. We have two changes, Jadeja and Bhuvi are out, Umesh Yadav and Stuart Binny come in.'Mortaza: 'We will like to bowl first. We want to bowl because of the rain that has been around, there might be something for the bowlers there. Last two games we have played really well, hopefully we can do even better today. Taskin misses out as he is not fit, Arafat Sunny comes in.'Bangladesh have won the toss and have opted to fieldSanjay Manjrekar after looking at the Indian players warming up also reckoned that Umesh Yadav and Stuart Binny might be in the playing XI.Pitch Report: 'The pitch looks slightly different from the one we had earlier. There are cracks and there is less dry grass. The pitch should aid the spinners. The captain winning the toss should bat first as this pitch might turn more in the second half,' reckons Sanjay ManjrekarWeather Update: We have had plenty of rain interruptions throughout the series and today is not going to be any different. As of now, it is not raining, but it is gloomy and there is a thunderstorm predicated later on. Hopefully, it will not affect the game much and we get a full game in. Fingers crossed!On the other hand, Indian bowlers have not looked threatening. Apart from Ashwin, none of the bowlers have looked like taking a wicket. However, the main concern has been the batting. Kohli has not scored runs, Rahane was dropped after one poor outing, Rohit and Dhawan have scored a fifty each, but not fluent ones. Dhoni promoted himself up the order, that too was ineffective. Raina has got out after getting starts. Overall, they have not clicked in unison. Dhoni's captaincy is also under threat as he became the first Indian skipper to lose a series to Bangladesh. So, plenty at stake in this final ODI for Team India.First up the hosts have played some excellent cricket - fearless and aggressive can be the two appropriate words that best describe Bangladesh's approach. Tamim and Soumya Sarkar have not been afraid to take the attack to the Indian bowlers at the start of the innings. The batsmen that follow have continued doing the same. When it comes to the bowling, one name that stands out is Mustafizur Rahman. The left-arm pacer has troubled the famed Indian batting with his variations. He has taken the most wickets by a bowler in his first two ODIs - 11 in total which included one 5-fer and one 6-fer. The rest of the bowlers have supported him ably.West Indies, Zimbabwe, New Zealand and Pakistan - teams whitewashed by Bangladesh. Will India be added to that list? Hello and welcome to the final ODI between these two sides. The hosts have taken an unassailable lead by winning the first two games, this is their best opportunity to beat the Asian giants and win the series 3-0. This will also be their third consecutive whitewash (after Zimbabwe and Pakistan), if they win this game. Let us have a look as to what has clicked for Bangladesh and what hasn't for India.PreviewHaving been outmatched in all departments in the first two matches, a jaded team India have nothing but pride to play for when they take on Bangladesh in the final ODI of the three-match series at Mirpur. The hosts, who have been a different limited-overs side since their quarter-final finish in the 2015 World Cup, will be looking to add to India's agony by clean sweeping the series.Bangladesh have become a force to reckon with in the ODI format and they have been on the ascendancy since their spirited performance in the World Cup. A 3-0 win against Pakistan and now a series victory against India have helped them take positive strides on the rankings chart and also paved the way for their qualification for the Champions Trophy in 2017. Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar and Shakib Al Hasan have all done their bit with the bat, but the hero of the series is the 19-year-old left-arm seamer, Mustafizur Rahman, who has left the Indian batsmen clueless with figures of 5/50 and 6/43 in his debut series. The second player ever to pick up fifers in his first two matches, Mustafizur will be hoping to extend his dream run, so will Bangladesh, who will be hoping that this is the start of a golden era.If the bowlers failed to come up with a disciplined performance in the first ODI, it was the lack of application from the batsmen the led to India's loss in the second ODI, which meant that they slipped to the maiden series loss against Bangladesh. Virat Kohli has not been in the best of form while others like Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan have failed to make big contributions after getting past fifties. The bowlers too have been wayward, making it a lot easier for the home-team batsmen. MS Dhoni will be hoping for his team-mates to come up with a solid effort in all departments and avoid the ignominy of a 0-3 defeat.Match Date: June 24, 2015Venue: Shere Bangla National Stadium, DhakaTime: 15:00 local time (14:30 IST)Weather: Maximum of 33 degree Celsius, mostly cloudy with patches of rainTeam News:Bangladesh:The confident Bangladesh team will not want to tinker with a winning combination and they are likely to go in with an unchanged eleven like they did for the second ODI.Probable XI: Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das (wk), Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza (c), Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur RahmanIndia:The Indian team, which has been playing continuous cricket since December 2014, has quite a few weary legs in the side. While the players will be hoping for a much-needed break at the conclusion of this series, Dhoni will be hoping that they can string together a clinical performance and restore some pride. As far as the team is concerned, India made three changes the last time and it remains to be seen if Dhoni surprises everyone again. Looking at how successful Bangladesh's seamers have been, Dhoni might be tempted to look at the all-round capabilities of Stuart Binny, who also had much success last year in Bangladesh.Probable XI: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni (c and wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel/Stuart Binny, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Dhawal KulkarniNumbers36 - With 30 fifties and six ODI hundreds, Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal are tied at the top-spot for the most fifty+ scores by Bangladesh players.3 - The number of wickets Shakib requires to become only the second Bangladesh player after Abdur Razzak to pick up 200 ODI wickets.Quotes:"I don't see them becoming complacent any more. They are hungry for more success. They are enjoying the victories and proud to represent Bangladesh."- Heath Streak, Bangladesh bowling coach"We will come and enjoy, maybe play a bit more freely. We won't think too much about the result. It will be the last match of the season."- MS Dhoni, India captainTeams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das(w), Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Rony Talukdar, Arafat Sunny, Mominul Haque, Jubair HossainIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(c/w), Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Dhawal Kulkarni, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ambati Rayudu, Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Stuart BinnyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
