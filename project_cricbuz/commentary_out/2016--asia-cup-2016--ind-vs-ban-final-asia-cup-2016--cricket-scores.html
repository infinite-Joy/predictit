INDIA:13.5 13.5Al-Amin to Dhoni, SIX, another chance for me to say, "Dhoni finishes off in style." We've seen this so many times. Full toss from Al-Amin and Dhoni muscles it over mid-wicket. India win the 2016 Asia Cup, this is their 6th Asia Cup title
INDIA:13.4 Al-Amin to Dhoni, FOUR, that is so unlike Dhoni! I say so unlike Dhoni because he bent his knees to hit this over extra-cover. Doesn't do that normally. Probably learnt this trick from Dwayne Bravo, who is an expert at the inside-out extra-cover drive. Full and outside off stump, Dhoni just lifts it over the infield and it bounces just inside the rope
INDIA:13.3 Al-Amin to Kohli, 3 runs, oh thankfully Al-Amin didn't get his foot to it, otherwise, the ankle or a part of his right leg would have come off! Low full toss, drilled very hard, the bowler tried to stop it with his leg, Mahmudullah runs to his right from long-off and stops the boundary, it's a direct-hit at the bowler's end, but Dhoni was well in, it deflects away and allows the batsmen an extra run
INDIA:13.2 Al-Amin to Dhoni, 1 run, very full and on the stumps, Dhoni drills it to long-on
INDIA:13.1 Al-Amin to Dhoni, SIX, oh my word! That's been muscled really hard! The Indian flags are being waved in the stands, while the Bangladeshi fans go silent. What? Full and in the slot? You got to be kidding me. Dhoni gets under it and smashes it over deep mid-wicket. Great start to the over for IndiaAl-Amin Hossain [2.0-0-10-1] is back into the attackGreat over under pressure. Just 5 runs and the wicket of Dhawan in it. India need 19 off 12 balls now. What a spell this is from Taskin. His figures read 3-0-14-1.
INDIA:12.6 Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, 1 run, good length delivery angled in, Dhoni almost flicks this to long-on. He'll keep strike with that run
INDIA:12.5 Taskin Ahmed to Dhoni, 2 runs, shortish delivery outside off stump, Dhoni mistimes the pull to deep mid-wicket, Kohli wanted two and pushed his captain, made it back comfortably as well. The throw should have gone to Dhoni's endMS Dhoni, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:12.4 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, out Caught by Soumya Sarkar!! Oh stylish hit and that's a brilliant grab at backward point. That breaks a 94-run stand. Is this the opening Bangladesh wanted to turn things around? Dhawan moved to the off-side, Taskin Ahmed bowled a low full toss outside off stump, Dhawan tried to open the face of the bat at the last moment and place the drive past backward point, didn't control it, Sarkar dives full length to his right at backward point and takes the catch. End of a fantastic and probably a match-winning knock. Dhawan c Soumya Sarkar b Taskin Ahmed 60(44) [4s-9 6s-1]Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:12.3 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, 1 run, almost a yorker outside off stump, Kohli drills it off the bottom of the bat to long-on. Taskin tumbles onto the ground after releasing the ball in his followthrough
INDIA:12.2 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, 1 run, fullish and on the stumps, Dhawan whips it along the ground to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:12.1 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, no run, Dhawan moves across the stumps and tries to target backward square leg as there is no one protecting the boundary, Taskin cramps him for room with a short of length delivery, which is mis-hit to the man in the circleTaskin Ahmed [2.0-0-9-0] is back into the attackIndia are doing this nicely. 24 needed off 18 balls and this is surely in their bag. Can Bangladesh steal it? Mortaza takes his time to set the field. Mahmudullah has a chat with Taskin, while Dhawan surveys the outfield
INDIA:11.6 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, 1 run, very full and outside off stump, Dhawan drives it along the ground to long-off
INDIA:11.5 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, FOUR, oh Taskin almost falls before diving, ran awkwardly there, the umpires are checking for a boundary. Hang on, he actually pushed the rope forward and his left hand was placed where the rope would have normally been, hence called a four and all that effort goes in vain. Shortish delivery on the stumps, Dhawan paddled it fine, Taskin tried to hunt it down from short fine leg but lost the race
INDIA:11.4 Nasir Hossain to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli steps out and tries to slog, goes off the inside half of the bat to long-on
INDIA:11.3 Nasir Hossain to Kohli, FOUR, full toss and that's been swung away across the line by Kohli. Easy pickings for the batsman and long-on or deep mid-wicket had no chance. Nasir Hossain's figures are seriously being spoiled
INDIA:11.2 Nasir Hossain to Kohli, FOUR, in the air, not timed well, the fielder dives but it escapes. Fell just short of Al-Amin at deep mid-wicket. Kohli went for the slog-sweep and mis-hit it, the fielder runs to his left, but couldn't get his body behind the line and prevent the boundary
INDIA:11.1 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, 1 run, short and asking for trouble, Dhawan pulls well but there is protection at deep backward square legA 11-run over from Shakib spoils things for Bangladesh after that 3-run over from Nasir Hossain.
INDIA:10.6 Shakib to Dhawan, 1 run, Dhawan goes for the drive with an open face and slices it to deep backward point
INDIA:10.5 Shakib to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli steps out and drives it to extra-cover
INDIA:10.4 Shakib to Dhawan, 1 run, very full and outside off stump, Dhawan reaches out and squeezes the drive to deep backward point
INDIA:10.3 Shakib to Dhawan, no run, shortish from Shakib, Dhawan comes down the track and defends back to the bowler
INDIA:10.2 Shakib to Dhawan, FOUR, full toss from Shakib, Dhawan reverse-sweeps it past the diving man at short third man and that brings up Dhawan's fifty. He was struggling to put bat on ball earlier in the tourney and he notches up a fifty in the final. His team-mates stand and applaud from the sidelines
INDIA:10.1 Shakib to Dhawan, FOUR, flighted delivery on the stumps, Dhawan slog-sweeps uppishly, deep mid-wicket runs forward and dives, doesn't get there, deflects the ball, the fielder backing up from deep backward square leg got completely put off and it ran away for fourShakib Al Hasan [1.0-0-15-0] is back into the attac
INDIA:9.6 Nasir Hossain to Kohli, no run, huuuuuge shout for LBW, not given by umpire Shozab Raza and Bangladesh can't believe it! Was there bat involved? Otherwise it looked OUT. Very full and on the stumps, Kohli attempts a fancy looking reverse-paddle, why would you want to do all that when conventional stuff works wonders for you, the replay is in and the umpire was very good. It was a top-edge onto Kohli's chest
INDIA:9.5 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, 1 run, Dhawan steps out and Nasir Hossain fires it wide outside off stump, the left-hander manages to reach out and tap it to sweeper cover
INDIA:9.4 Nasir Hossain to Kohli, 1 run, good looking inside-out drive, but straight to long-off. Turning out to be an excellent over, just 2 off the first 4 balls
INDIA:9.3 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, 1 run, this time Dhawan sweeps uppishly through backward square leg, but there is protection in the deep
INDIA:9.2 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, no run, good bowling from Nasir. Saw Dhawan jumping out of the crease and dragged it back, Dhawan tried to work it on the on-side, got an inside edge onto pad
INDIA:9.1 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, no run, round the wicket to Dhawan and beats him on the flick once again, didn't turn, Dhawan gets hit on the pad, was going down the leg-side thoughSo the equation reads 53 off 36 balls. With 9 wickets in hand, you would pick the batting team, but you never know! Bangladesh desperately need a couple of quick wickets.
INDIA:8.6 Mortaza to Kohli, no run, sensible from Kohli, already 9 off the over, hence respects the length delivery with a defence back to the bowler
INDIA:8.5 Mortaza to Dhawan, 1 run, once again that across the stumps movement from Dhawan, short of length delivery from Mortaza, which is punched off the back foot towards mid-on
INDIA:8.4 Mortaza to Dhawan, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Dhawan dabs fine, but picks out the man at short third man. A couple of yards either side of the fielder would have been four
INDIA:8.3 Mortaza to Dhawan, SIX, this is brave from Dhawan. He moves across the sticks this time, gets down on one knee and picks it away nicely over backward square leg. There was a man in the deep, but he was only a spectator
INDIA:8.2 Mortaza to Kohli, 1 run, this is cleverly steered down to third man off the back foot, just opened the face of the bat at the last moment, but the man at third man was quick enough to move to his left and bend down in time
INDIA:8.1 Mortaza to Dhawan, 1 run, Dhawan exposes all three sticks even before the bowler got into his delivery stride, it was the slower ball on the shorter side and Dhawan cut it hard to the man sweeping on the off-side
INDIA:7.6 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, 1 run, full toss outside off stump, Dhawan steps and drives along the ground to sweeper cover
INDIA:7.5 Nasir Hossain to Kohli, 1 run, oh a direct-hit would have been very tight, but the replay shows that he would have been in. He hit this to mid-wicket and set off, Mortaza had a shy at the bowler's end, Kohli had to really stretch a long way to make his ground
INDIA:7.4 Nasir Hossain to Kohli, no run, fullish and outside off stump, Kohli drives hard, but Mahmudullah intervenes at cover
INDIA:7.3 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, 1 run, Dhawan steps out and inside-edges the drive wide of long-on
INDIA:7.2 Nasir Hossain to Dhawan, no run, shout for LBW and the crowd wakes up suddenly. Shake of the head from the umpire though as it was sliding down the leg-side, Dhawan missed the flick, the ball hit him in line with middle and leg but the angle from round the wicket was taking it past the sticks. Hawk-Eye confirms the same
INDIA:7.1 Nasir Hossain to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli wanted to flick to mid-wicket, but he closed the bat face early and the leading edge rolled towards backward pointNasir Hossain, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
INDIA:6.6 Mortaza to Dhawan, no run, this is driven back to the bowler
INDIA:6.5 Mortaza to Kohli, 1 run, again a poor delivery, good length delivery down the leg-side, Kohli would have wanted to tickle it fine, but only managed to inside-edge it onto thigh pad
INDIA:6.4 Mortaza to Kohli, FOUR, have Bangladesh lost it completely? They have been really bad with the ball in the last few minutes. This time the captain himself sprays a short of length delivery down the leg-side, Kohli only flicked it along the ground through backward square leg, Taskin ran to his left from fine leg and even dived full length, but he was never going to stop the ball
INDIA:6.3 Mortaza to Dhawan, 1 run, shortish and on the stumps, Dhawan rolls his wrists on the pull to send it along the ground to deep square leg. 50 up for India and a few players from the dug out applaud
INDIA:6.2 Mortaza to Dhawan, no run, the off-cutting slower delivery across the left-hander, Dhawan was beaten for pace, poked on the push and got beatenRahim comes up to the stumps to prevent Dhawan from racing down the pitch
INDIA:6.1 Mortaza to Kohli, 1 run, shortish delivery outside off stump, Kohli hops and steers it to third manMashrafe Mortaza, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackIt was 19/1 after 4 overs, but now it is 48/1. Gee, this game of cricket changes so quickly.
INDIA:5.6 Shakib to Dhawan, FOUR, the crowd goes silent. Actually, they have been silent for the last 8-9 minutes. The previous over went for 14 and this one has cost them 15. Short delivery from Shakib, really bad ball and being a batsman himself he would admit it, Dhawan rocks back and pulls hard, deep mid-wicket dives to his left but in vain
INDIA:5.5 Shakib to Dhawan, 2 runs, Dhawan steps out and nudges it to mid-wicket, the fielder rushes from the deep, but Dhawan was always keen for the second and he would have been hom even with a clean pick up
INDIA:5.4 Shakib to Dhawan, no run, shortish and on the stumps, Dhawan defends it into the on-side
INDIA:5.3 Shakib to Dhawan, FOUR, Dhawan is very strong square of the wicket on the off-side and you can't bowl short to him. He goes deep in the crease, allows the ball to come and opens the face of the bat at the last moment to cut it past backward point and short third man
INDIA:5.2 Shakib to Kohli, 1 run, tossed up outside off stump, Kohli waits and drives along the ground to long-off
INDIA:5.1 Shakib to Kohli, FOUR, short ball and it's been hit in the air, no one at mid-wicket, would have been straight to him, in fact this is in gap between long-on and deep mid-wicket and it's a four. Kohli went back and deep in the crease, pulled it from the bottom of the bat and it escaped for fourShakib Al Hasan, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
INDIA:4.6 Abu Hider to Dhawan, FOUR, edged, there is a man at slip but he's very wide! How lucky is Dhawan? All of a sudden, India have managed a 14-run over. This could change the momentum of the game. Good length delivery close to the off stump, Dhawan goes for the push, the front foot not fully forward, a thick edge results, fly slip is very wide and it goes to his right despite a dive
INDIA:4.5 Abu Hider to Kohli, 1 run, direct-hit, but Kohli was well in. Fullish and outside off stump, Kohli drives it to mid-off, takes on the fielder and makes his ground before the throw disturbed the stumps
INDIA:4.4 Abu Hider to Kohli, FOUR, in the airrrrrrr and just over the man at mid-off. Kohli wants to put the new bowler off very quickly. Fullish and outside off stump, Kohli steps out and goes for the lofted off-drive, Tamim was interested for a while, he jumped high and went right-handed, but he had to be a foot taller to have a chance. Big relief on Kohli's face after seeing the ball fly past TamimAbu Hider to Kohli for the first time! Slip waiting for the edge
INDIA:4.3 Abu Hider to Dhawan, 1 run, it's been three good deliveries first up from Abu Hider. Full and on the off stump, Dhawan drives it towards mid-off, not from the middle of the bat though
INDIA:4.2 Abu Hider to Dhawan, no run, where was Dhawan going? Fullish and aimed at the off stump, Dhawan drives on the walk and looks for a run, but the bowler fields the ball and forces Dhawan to rush backSlip added now
INDIA:4.1 Abu Hider to Dhawan, FOUR, edged but no slip. Good length delivery just outside off stump, probably left the left-hander at the last moment, Dhawan was pushing at it with hard hands and the thick edge ran away through the vacant slip cordonAbu Hider, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attackIs Kohli going to bat through and the others go for it from the other end? Is that the strategy? Kohli's approach so far suggests so. He's only keen on rotating the strike.
INDIA:3.6 Al-Amin to Dhawan, 1 run, in the air, man in the deep, but it falls well short. Shortish and angled across, Dhawan goes for the pull, had to fetch it from outside off, mistimed it completely and it landed well before the man coming from deep mid-wicket
INDIA:3.5 Al-Amin to Kohli, 1 run, back of a length outside off stump, watchfully worked behind square leg on the on-side
INDIA:3.4 Al-Amin to Dhawan, 1 run, Dhawan jumps out of the crease and drives the short of length delivery to mid-off
INDIA:3.3 Al-Amin to Dhawan, FOUR, oh that's poor from the fielder at short fine leg. Skipper Mortaza is not happy and Taskin is the culprit. Poor delivery from Al-Amin though. Can't bowl down the leg-side with fine leg inside the ring, Dhawan glances, Taskin dives to his right, should have been stopped but it escaped
INDIA:3.2 Al-Amin to Dhawan, no run, down the track but Al-Amin drags his length back and forces the batsman to tap the ball back to his left
INDIA:3.1 Al-Amin to Dhawan, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, just a bit of movement into the left-hander, Dhawan mistimes the drive into the off-sideThis is a great start for Bangladesh. The bowling has been tight and the Indian batsmen are not willing to take risks yet. The asking rate has jumped to 9.
INDIA:2.6 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, 1 run, Taskin charges in and bowls a back of a length on the leg stump, Dhawan works it behind square, short fine leg tidies up. He'll keep strike
INDIA:2.5 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, 1 run, width on offer outside off stump, Kohli goes for the cut, again not bouncing much, the ball goes off the bottom of the bat and runs away to the right of backward point
INDIA:2.4 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, no run, good looking delivery and neatly played by Kohli as well. Good length delivery angled in on off stump, Kohli watchfully works it to mid-on
INDIA:2.3 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery just coming back in, Kohli defends off the back foot with soft hands
INDIA:2.2 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, 2 runs, punched off the front foot, the ball kept low and it went off the bottom of the bat, Kohli is quick, puts pressure on the man at sweeper cover and easily comes back as the fielder in the deep had a bit of ground to cover running to his right
INDIA:2.1 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, no run, wow! Good delivery. Fullish and swinging back in late, Kohli wasn't fully forward on the drive, got it a thickish inside edge that rolled back to the bowlerYuvraj Singh is padded up.
INDIA:1.6 Al-Amin to Dhawan, no run, fullish on middle, Dhawan defends
INDIA:1.5 Al-Amin to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli walks towards the bowler and defends this with soft hands towards point, Dhawan responds for a quick single and makes his ground. No direct-hit at the striker's end
INDIA:1.4 Al-Amin to Kohli, 2 runs, oh that's hit very hard first ball, Mahmudullah runs around and stops, oh he fumbles and it almost touches the rope. Short and wide outside off stump, Kohli cuts really well through cover, the man at sweeper runs to his right, makes a tumbling save, only managed a half-stop as it turned out, then quickly recovered and dived to pull it back just in timeVirat Kohli, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:1.3 Al-Amin to Rohit, out Caught by Soumya Sarkar!! Edgedddd, only one slip in place and the fielder makes no mistake. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Al-Amin bowls with a scrambled seam and sometimes the batsman can't make out which way it is going to go. This one just held its line, Rohit played a flashy-drive away from the body and paid the price. Thick edge resulted, which was swallowed to his left by Sarkar. Rohit is a batsman in form and this is a massive blow for India and the perfect start for Bangladesh. Rohit c Soumya Sarkar b Al-Amin 1(5)Al-Amin to Rohit, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:1.2 Al-Amin to Rohit, no run, shout for LBW and the crowd gets behind as well, umpire shakes his head, Al-Amin has a look at him but it was a good call from umpire Shozab Raza. Al-Amin asks if it was high and Raza responds in kind. Slightly back of a length nipping back in, Rohit was caught on the crease, feet went nowhere and it hit him high on the padBoth third man and fine leg are in
INDIA:1.1 Al-Amin to Rohit, no run, a back foot punch with an angled bat, Rohit covered for the late movement away from him on this short of length delivery, hit it well, but straight to cover-pointAl-Amin Hossain, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackLone slip for Al-Amin as well
INDIA:0.6 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, no run, short and angled across, a confident looking Dhawan would have normally upper-cut that, mind you he plays that upper-cut with his feet in the air so well, but he wants to be careful here. Just watches the ball sail through to the keeperLooks like something behind the bowler is bothering Dhawan again. He stops Taskin and then walks towards the umpire to point out something. All sorted now
INDIA:0.5 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, no run, shortish and on the off stump, just a bit of away movement on this one, Dhawan is slightly opened up in his back foot defence
INDIA:0.4 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, FOUR, now that is from the sweetest spot of the bat. What a shot! Short of a length just outside off stump, Dhawan waited for it to come, bent his knees a bit and punched it square of the wicket on the off-side, it rocketed through cover-point and backward point. The good thing there was Dhawan never tried to hit it too hard, which made the shot look even better
INDIA:0.3 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, no run, oh that was a friendly delivery from Taskin, short of length delivery down the leg-side, a fine little tickle would have been four, but Dhawan is totally out of form that he fails to connect and wears it on the thigh padDhawan has hardly scored runs in the tournament so far. Can he do it today? A slight delay as Dhawan is not happy with the sightscreen.
INDIA:0.2 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 1 run, bit of steep bounce on this short of length delivery outside off stump, came back in slightly as well, Rohit rises tall and runs it down to third man
INDIA:0.1 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, no swing, no movement off the pitch as well, Rohit stands tall and easily defends it into the off-side. He found the middle of the bat as well, something that would make him feel really goodRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. Taskin Ahmed will open the attackWelcome back for the run chase. The Bangladeshi players are making their way out to the middle. India need to chase just over 8 runs per over. They've been set a good target for a 15-over game. Rohit and Dhawan stride out as well. Can the hosts manage a few early breakthroughs and push India back? Taskin to begin with just one slip in place.After an hour-long thunderstorm had been eclipsed by Dhaka's drainage brilliance, India opted to bowl on a balding pitch - perhaps the best of this Asia Cup. Ashwin started the proceedings in a typical Dhoni-like move only to see Bangladesh off to a sane start. But in trying to cap off a 13-run over with another big hit, a greedy Soumya Sarkar perished to Nehra and Bumrah trapped Tamim soon after to render the powerplay mediocre. Pandya's first over proved expensive but mid-innings runs were largely kept in check, courtesy constant juggling of bowlers from Dhoni. Ashwin returned to send Shakib back in a Dhaka-muting move. The twelfth over then saw Mushfiqur come second to a Kohli throw while Mortaza slogged his way to a golden duck. The over threatened to waterjug all the momentum but Pandya yielded to some late Mahmudullah fireworks, taking the Bangladeshi score to realms of defendable. Chase minutes away!That's it. 120 on the board. Despite a parsimonious last over, Bangladesh have finished well with 42 coming off the final three. Mahmudullah's striking prowess providing that X-factor when they so desperately needed it.1
BANGLADESH:14.6 Bumrah to S Rahman, 1 run, well bowled, very well bowled. Saw the batsman shaping for a reverse-lap and targetted leg-stump with a low full toss. Rahman ended up having to reach out for it, no power on the shot and finds backward point
BANGLADESH:14.5 Bumrah to Mahmudullah, 1 run, full toss around knee height, most times that would be in the stands. But given how quick Bumrah's action is, Mahmudullah is late with the slog, spoons it off the splice in front of long-on
BANGLADESH:14.4 Bumrah to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, full and fast again, Mahmudullah swats it off the inside half of the bat wide of long-on for another couple
BANGLADESH:14.3 Bumrah to Mahmudullah, no run, he's out-thought the batsman here. Sees Mahmudullah backing away and slips in a bouncer. That's the last thing Mahmudullah expected. Tried a rushed hook shot but the ball sailed over his top-edge. Oh, on second glance from side-on, Bumrah's got away with a wide. Too high
BANGLADESH:14.2 Bumrah to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, Jadeja is sure to have a bruised ego after today. The batsmen have taken him on every time and got away with it. Full ball, very hard to get under as Mahmudullah tries to deposit it over long-on. Hits it along the ground wide of the fielder and hares back to keep strike
BANGLADESH:14.1 Bumrah to S Rahman, 1 run, hohoho! Mighty fine yorker tailing in on middle, Rahman swings, chops it off the inside edge onto pad and collects a single in front of backward pointJasprit Bumrah [2.0-0-6-1] is back into the attack35 runs have come off the last 2 overs. Now to finish it with a windfall. Won't be easy with Bumrah charging in.
BANGLADESH:13.6 Pandya to S Rahman, 1 run, finishes the over well. But that's after an over which has bled 21. Bang into the blockhole on middle, Rahman squeezes it to backward square leg for a single
BANGLADESH:13.5 Pandya to Mahmudullah, 1 run, oh he's missed out! A blatant full toss around off, Mahmudullah's eyes saw red and he swung hard. Lost his shape and dragged it off the inside half to deep mid-wicket
BANGLADESH:13.5 Pandya to Mahmudullah, wide, tries to follow Mahmudullah as he backs away, but goes way down leg. Allows Mahmudullah to pull himself inside the line of the ball and collect a wide
BANGLADESH:13.4 Pandya to Mahmudullah, SIX, Dhoni runs straight towards Pandya after this. Mahmudullah is shredding him to pieces. Bits of Hardik Pandya are flying around Dhaka. Dhoni tries to gather them. But another poor ball. Misses the yorker by quite a bit and is smited over wide long-on
BANGLADESH:13.3 Pandya to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, and he responds well. Almost a yorker on middle, Mahmudullah having made room can't get elevation as he tries to launch it downtown. Still hits it well enough straight of long-on where Raina slides and flicks it back to the long-off fielder
BANGLADESH:13.2 Pandya to Mahmudullah, SIX, now, now, now. He did take the cover off that one. Ouch. That's a dagger through Pandya's heart which leaves an exit wound on his back as well. Dishes up a length ball on the stumps, Mahmudullah backs away and clobbers it over mid-wicket. Soars into the stands. This is sure to get the young man's heart pounding
BANGLADESH:13.1 Pandya to Mahmudullah, FOUR, now that will help. What a shot from Mahmudullah. Didn't look to take the cover of the ball, saw the full toss outside off, cleared the front leg and simply lofted it wide of long-offHardik Pandya [2.0-0-14-0] is back into the attackA couple of overs left and Bangladesh need a lot more from them. Just feel that they are 15-20 shy than they ought to be at this stage..
BANGLADESH:12.6 Nehra to Mahmudullah, 1 run, fullish and curling away outside off, Mahmudullah tries to carve it over extra-cover but gets it much squarer due to the bat turning and him slicing the shot
BANGLADESH:12.5 Nehra to Mahmudullah, FOUR, bazuka! That's a missile past Nehra's left boot. Full ball on the stumps, missed the yorker by 6 inches or so and finds himself drilled back hard as Mahmudullah clears his front leg. Very hard
BANGLADESH:12.4 Nehra to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, good work from Pandya in the deep. Spotted a fielder running towards him, knew his momentum would take him on the ground, so he flicked it to his teammate. Earlier, Mahmudullah had smartly punched a slower length ball wide of backward point. Waited for it and then sliced it well
BANGLADESH:12.3 Nehra to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, the pitch looks to be two-paced for sure. Another batsman being hurried by the short of length delivery looking to pull. Spoons it off the splice in front of long-on and enough time to nick a couple
BANGLADESH:12.2 Nehra to S Rahman, 1 run, slingy yorker wide of off, can't do much with those. Rahman slashes a mistimed drive to sweeper cover
BANGLADESH:12.1 Nehra to S Rahman, FOUR, he's in amazing form, this lad. Walks across shaping to scoop, reaches out with bat in front of body to convert it into a low full toss, and laps it over short fine leg. Probably got it closer to the bottom of the bat but he made enough of a connectionAshish Nehra [2.0-0-19-1] is back into the attack
BANGLADESH:11.6 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, 1 run, flatter and sliding on towards off, Rahman backs away a bit and dabs it behind backward point
BANGLADESH:11.5 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, 2 runs, patted towards extra-cover where a misfield defuses a run-out chance. Instead, they end up with twoMahmudullah, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:11.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Mortaza, out Caught by Kohli!! Another batsman has found out the perils of going after Jadeja. So quick through the air, hardly any bounce due to the round arm action. Almost like left-arm underground. Fires it at the stumps from round the wicket, Mortaza backs away and slogs, mistimes it and holes out to deep mid-wicket where Kohli takes it easily and continues with his showboating. This time prowls forward doing a lion-dance. Mortaza c Kohli b Ravindra Jadeja 0(1)Ravindra Jadeja to Mortaza, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Mashrafe Mortaza, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:11.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Rahim, out Rahim Run Out!! 1 run completed! And we are going upstairs. Rahim was struggling to make it back. Took very heavy strides and had to put the dive. A rocket throw from Kohli at deep mid-wicket. Straight over the bails which are whipped off in a jiffy by Dhoni. Rahim has made the crease with the dive, but is the bat in the air? It bounced up unfortunately after hitting the ground. And yes, Rahim is out of here. Oh, look at Kohli. Gesturing towards the audience to keep their mouths closed. Rahim made room and mistimed the slog wide of Kohli who was very quick to skate across and return the throw. Rahim run out (Kohli/Dhoni) 4(5)Ravindra Jadeja to Rahim, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
BANGLADESH:11.2 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, 1 run, pushed to extra-cover
BANGLADESH:11.1 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, 2 runs, never easy to slog Jadeja. Rahman tries nonetheless after stepping out, loses his shape and drags it off the inside edge through mid-wicketRavindra Jadeja [2.0-0-18-0] is back into the attack
BANGLADESH:10.6 Pandya to Rahim, no run, and again. Cannoned into the blockhole on off, Rahim quickly gets his bat down and drills it straight. Pandya dives to his left and stops a prospective single
BANGLADESH:10.5 Pandya to S Rahman, 1 run, brilliant yorker. Saw the batsman coming towards him and fired it full and fast, Rahman barely manages to squeeze a drive to long-off
BANGLADESH:10.4 Pandya to S Rahman, no run, excellent slower delivery. Due to the lack of pace, the ball dies from a good length and sneaks under Rahman's big swing across the line. On a couple of bounces to Dhoni
BANGLADESH:10.3 Pandya to Rahim, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off, Rahim rolls the wrists on the ball after standing on his toes and glides it down to third man
BANGLADESH:10.2 Pandya to S Rahman, 1 run, now he's premeditating stuff, which is never smart. What's more, they've taken on Jadeja again and he's missed again. Back of length outside off, he tries to slap it over the infield but gets it high on the bat straight towards mid-off. Tries a single and would have been gone
BANGLADESH:10.1 Pandya to S Rahman, no run, excellent stop by Dhoni. Most keepers wouldn't have been able to stop it as they would have been wrong footed. But Dhoni bends very little if at all at the point of delivery. Length ball outside off, Rahman has a hoick at it, gets a big inside edge and nearly chops it back on off-stump. Missed by a whiskerHardik Pandya [1.0-0-11-0] is back into the attac
BANGLADESH:9.6 Ashwin to S Rahman, 1 run, quicker and turning in on middle and leg, nurdled through square leg. Excellent variations in pace and flight
BANGLADESH:9.5 Ashwin to Rahim, 1 run, flatter this time and slightly short on the stumps, Rahim pulls his weight on the back foot, swivels and pulls it with the turn to deep backward square
BANGLADESH:9.4 Ashwin to S Rahman, 1 run, shimmies down again and nudges it wide of the fielder this time to get off strike
BANGLADESH:9.3 Ashwin to S Rahman, no run, turning in towards off and middle, clipped to short mid-wicket after a couple of strides out of the crease
BANGLADESH:9.2 Ashwin to Rahim, 1 run, tossed up very full on off, Rahim whips it hard down to long-on to get off the markMushfiqur Rahim, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:9.1 Ashwin to Shakib, out Caught by Bumrah!! Look at those faces in the crowd. People have hands covering their mouths, scratching their cheeks, and what not. Shakib was looking good until now, but then he's decided to take on the genius of India's spin wizard. Ashwin saw him making room, followed him while keeping it slower through the air. As a result he generated more bounce from a length, caught the top-edge of Shakib's attempted sweep and offered a simple reverse-cup take to short fine leg. Shakib c Bumrah b Ashwin 21(16) [4s-3]Ashwin to Shakib, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Ravichandran Ashwin [2.0-0-10-0] is back into the attack
BANGLADESH:8.6 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, no run, the trajectory is flat again which tempts Rahman into thinking that the length will be short, he stays rooted and flashes at it, sneaks under the willow through to Dhoni
BANGLADESH:8.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Shakib, 1 run, takes a couple of steps down the track, meets it on the full and whips it down to long-on
BANGLADESH:8.4 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, 1 run, drops it slightly short outside off, Rahman backs away and cuts it to deep point
BANGLADESH:8.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Shakib, 1 run, another dart on the stumps from over the wicket, Shakib makes room and slogs it to deep mid-wicket. Just in front of the fielder it landed
BANGLADESH:8.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Shakib, 2 runs, flatter on off, the length is there to be carved inside out and Shakib doesn't hold back. Slices it though and lucky to clear extra-cover
BANGLADESH:8.1 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, 1 run, Jadeja is convinced, arms in the air as he runs backwards in appeal. Quick arm-ball which hits Rahman's front leg as he tries to push into the off-side, but there's an inside edge involved. Top call
BANGLADESH:7.6 Pandya to Shakib, FOUR, oh cheeky! Walks across the stumps to a length ball, picks it smartly and scoops it over short fine leg
BANGLADESH:7.5 Pandya to Shakib, no run, another Bangladeshi southpaw hurling down the pitch in an attempt to heave the ball into outer space. The extra-bounce foiling the attempt again. Bounces over the wafting willow
BANGLADESH:7.4 Pandya to Shakib, FOUR, he's banged one in and Shakib has taken on the challenge. Pulls it hard, there is a man in the deep but it's wide of him. The umpires are checking if it has carried all the way. No. On the half-volley
BANGLADESH:7.3 Pandya to S Rahman, 1 run, back of a length delivery angled into middle and leg, nudged behind square from the crease
BANGLADESH:7.2 Pandya to Shakib, 1 run, fullish on middle, Shakib aims an expansive drive down the ground, but the bat twists in his hands and he drags it in the air to the left of Pandya. Would I label that as a chance? Nah. Would be harsh. He hardly had time to bend, didn't even get a hand
BANGLADESH:7.1 Pandya to S Rahman, 1 run, short of length delivery hurrying onto Rahman's attempted pull, he swats it off the under-edge into the on-sideHardik Pandya, right-arm medium, comes into the attackDhoni mixing and matching his bowlers
BANGLADESH:6.6 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, 1 run, flatter and sliding on outside off, Rahman prods across and dinks it softly into the off-side for a quick well judged single
BANGLADESH:6.5 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, FOUR, now some finesse from Rahman. The line was outside off, the pace was Jadeja like, he employs the reverse-lap to tickle it past Dhoni's gloves and into the third man fence
BANGLADESH:6.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Shakib, 1 run, tries an encore but can't get it wide enough of long-on this time. The fielder runs to his right and cuts it off
BANGLADESH:6.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Shakib, FOUR, another pop-gun dart from Jadeja on the stumps, Shakib makes room this time and heaves it wide of long-on. Wide enough of the fielder for a boundary
BANGLADESH:6.2 Ravindra Jadeja to S Rahman, 1 run, crrrunched off the back foot. Short and wide, Rahman goes deep in the crease and slaps it to deep point
BANGLADESH:6.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Shakib, 1 run, fired in on middle, flicked with the turn to Rohit at short mid-wicket. Another error in the field allowing the strike to rotateRavindra Jadeja, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
BANGLADESH:5.6 Ashwin to Shakib, 1 run, Ashwin is teasing them at the moment. Varying it nicely in the air, lures Shakib forward on the drive this time, he aims for a single to long-off but can't get past short extra-cover. A fumble allows a run
BANGLADESH:5.5 Ashwin to S Rahman, 1 run, tossed up on off, appreciable turn from a length, Rahman nurdles it behind square
BANGLADESH:5.4 Ashwin to S Rahman, no run, reverses his stance and hits the sweep well but straight to backward point
BANGLADESH:5.4 Ashwin to S Rahman, wide, gets the line wrong, lots of air on middle, turns down the leg-side
BANGLADESH:5.3 Ashwin to Shakib, 1 run, looped up outside off, Shakib once again creates his own room and drives it crisply with the turn to sweeper cover
BANGLADESH:5.2 Ashwin to Shakib, no run, tossed up with the length slightly short from round the wicket, keeps coming towards Shakib as he backs away looking to cut, ends up being too cramped and chopping it back to the bowler
BANGLADESH:5.1 Ashwin to S Rahman, 1 run, stretches across with back knee bent, reaches for the quicker and wider off-break and paddles the sweep to deep backward squareRavichandran Ashwin [1.0-0-5-0] is back into the attackAshwin back and the slip has disappeared
BANGLADESH:4.6 Bumrah to Shakib, no run, good length delivery wide of off, tempts Shakib to have a big slash at it, but again there is a tennis-ball like bounce to beat the edgeDhoni has two slips in place..
BANGLADESH:4.5 Bumrah to Shakib, no run, extra bounce for a spirited Bumrah from a back of a length, rushes on towards Shakib as he tries to work it through the on-side and hits him on the thigh pad. Too highShakib Al Hasan, left handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:4.4 Bumrah to Tamim, out Lbw!! Bumrah hits Tamim on the pad, a prolonged wait follows before finally the finger goes up. That looked dead on first glance. Length ball angled in towards middle from round the wicket, Tamim bends his front knee and tries to swing it across the line, anticipates more bounce than there is and the ball sneaks under the willow. HawkEye shows it hitting middle of middle. Tamim lbw b Bumrah 13(17) [4s-2]Bumrah to Tamim, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
BANGLADESH:4.3 Bumrah to S Rahman, 1 run, clipped wonderfully off the pads to deep backward square
BANGLADESH:4.2 Bumrah to Tamim, 1 run, jumps out of the crease to heave at a slippery short of length delivery, it hurries onto him, hits him high on the bat and rolls in front of mid-off
BANGLADESH:4.1 Bumrah to S Rahman, 1 run, the madness continues. You give Jadeja enough chances, and he'll make good sooner or later. Not this time. Rahman fails to tuck a back of a length delivery through the on-side, it deflects off the thigh pad in front of backward point where Jadeja is effervescent as ever. Swoops in quickly and fires a throw which would have found a diving Tamim short had it hitSabbir Rahman, right handed bat, comes to the creaseFrom what I have seen off Bangladesh, I think they'll keep going.
BANGLADESH:3.6 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, out Caught by Pandya!! Listen to this, listen to this ... absolutely nothing. Dead silence. Sarkar gets carried away by the adrenaline rush. Isn't content with a 13-run over. Swishes hard at a length ball trying to heave it over the on-side, never in control of the extra-bounce. Pops up off the splice and a simple grab for Pandya at mid-off. Soumya Sarkar c Pandya b Nehra 14(9) [4s-3]Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
BANGLADESH:3.5 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, filthy delivery which has sent the crowd into near eruption. Short of length and angling down leg, Sarkar lifts his front leg Gordon Greenidge like, then whips the short-arm pull over short fine leg. Wow, the atmosphere is intense
BANGLADESH:3.4 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, wooosh! That's nearly taken Tamim's head to the boundary. Ducked underneath it in time, did the non-striker. Takes a shimmy down the pitch, gets close enough to the pitch of the ball and blazes it straight back. Meaty blow
BANGLADESH:3.3 Nehra to Tamim, 1 run, patted in front of Jadeja at backward point and they take him on. Smart? Not really but Sarkar was safely in. But unfortunately, Jadeja's throw has hit his back calf. Doesn't look in much pain
BANGLADESH:3.2 Nehra to Tamim, FOUR, mid-off, mid-off, and it's over him! Just about. Tamim was starting to get twitchy. Goes flashing after a length ball which bounces spongily, gets it high on the willow but the batswing takes it over the infield
BANGLADESH:3.1 Nehra to Tamim, no run, ridiculous stroke! Swinging away on a fuller length outside off, and Tamim is trying to whip it through the on-side. Lucky not to nick it
BANGLADESH:2.6 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, no run, good length delivery which keeps a touch low outside off, Sarkar stays in the crease looking to dab but the lack of bounce deceives him
BANGLADESH:2.5 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, 2 runs, that's chaotic running. A direct-hit and Tamim was gone despite a dive. Back of a length outside off, Sarkar swats the pull to the right of mid-on. Ashwin dives and parries it towards Pandya who gathers and shies at the non-striker's end. Didn't miss by much
BANGLADESH:2.4 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, no run, ugly swing and a miss. On a good length outside off, Sarkar wafts with feet going nowhere, it's not in his swinging arc and misses
BANGLADESH:2.3 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, no run, cramps Sarkar for room as he tries to cut a back of a length delivery, late on the stroke and misses
BANGLADESH:2.2 Bumrah to Tamim, 1 run, angled in towards middle on a good length, Tamim swivels on the back foot slightly and swings it behind square. Not in any control but it's spooned over the infield
BANGLADESH:2.1 Bumrah to Tamim, no run, skids on from a good length and with the angle in towards off, bounces more than Tamim expects and he has to drop his bottom hand in defence. Gets it close to the shoulder of the batJasprit Bumrah, right-arm medium, comes into the attackSo the Ashwin experiment lasts just one over. Bumrah on from round the wicket.
BANGLADESH:1.6 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, patted to backward point
BANGLADESH:1.5 Nehra to Tamim, 1 run, short ball which finds Tamim waiting in the crease attempting a pull. Got good height above the shoulder, might have stuck into the pitch slightly as Tamim went through with the stroke early. Spoons it up off the toe-end in front of mid-on
BANGLADESH:1.4 Nehra to Tamim, no run, Tamim has to bail out of the stroke. He came running down the track again, but gave his cards too early. Allowed Nehra to pound one very short and Tamim does the smart thing not to go chasing
BANGLADESH:1.3 Nehra to Tamim, no run, fullish and a hint of outswing from a length outside off, Tamim covers the line this time with a bigger front foot stride and gently pushes to cover
BANGLADESH:1.2 Nehra to Tamim, no run, oh beaut! Draws Tamim forward and across, has him feeling for the length ball which shapes away ever so slightly to beat the edge. One slip is waiting for the edge
BANGLADESH:1.2 Nehra to Tamim, wide, slips one down the leg-side, maybe looking for swing which isn't there, drifts on with the arm. Tamim has a big whip at it but fails to connect
BANGLADESH:1.1 Nehra to Tamim, FOUR, oh well, Tamim being Tamim! Gives Nehra the charge first ball and converts it into a half-volley on the pads, then jerks his wrists and flicks it past square legAshish Nehra, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
BANGLADESH:0.6 Ashwin to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, nicely tossed up outside off, Sarkar leans forward, towards the ball and cracks the drive through the covers. That should settle the nerves
BANGLADESH:0.5 Ashwin to Tamim, 1 run, this time he goes deeper in the crease and tucks it from the pads through mid-wicket
BANGLADESH:0.4 Ashwin to Tamim, no run, another flatter off-break, no turn from a length on middle, again Tamim is late on the flick. The new ball will simply slide on though
BANGLADESH:0.3 Ashwin to Tamim, no run, carrom ball, quicker and flatter outside off, cramps Tamim for room as he cuts it to point
BANGLADESH:0.2 Ashwin to Tamim, no run, darts in a flatter one this time, skids on outside leg and Tamim is late on the flick, gets hit on the thigh pad
BANGLADESH:0.1 Ashwin to Tamim, no run, big appeal first ball. Generously tossed up, Tamim plonked forward to defend but played for turn, which wasn't there. Hits him on the knee-roll but the impact was slightly outside off. Boos reverberate across the stadiumTamim and Soumya Sarkar are at the crease. Tamim is on strike. Ashwin will open the attackQuite incredible that we are having a match after that armageddon. What's more incredible is to see that not a single soul has left the stadium. Dhoni said that a shorter game favours the team batting second. But I don't think that Bangladesh would mind having been put in. Gives them an opportunity to put a score on the board and avoid the pressure of chasing in a final. The storm has passed. And out come the Bangladeshi openers to try and conjure another. Thunderous applause from a boisterous crowd. Dhoni has a word with Nehra as the Indians saunter towards the centre. Okay, so this is why. Must have been telling him that Ashwin will open the bowling. The countdown begins. A slip in place as Ash begins from round the wicket..Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahman, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Abu Hider, Al-Amin Hossain, Taskin AhmedIndia (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashish Nehra, Jasprit BumrahMortaza: "We wanted to field as well, but now we don't have any choice, now we need to bat well. The ball can do its bit early on, but we will have to deal with the swing in the first 2-3 overs. The crowd has been supporting us. We have two changes, Nasir Hossain and Abu Hider Rony are in for Mithun and Arafat Sunny."Dhoni: "We will bowl first. It's a shortened game. So I feel it is a bit of an advantage batting second because it is a 15-over game. This team is quite settled. We have the same team that played Sri Lanka. I think this looks like a side where everything is covered."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe captains are walking out for the toss.Pitch Report: "Looking at the outfield, you wouldn't think there was rain here a couple of hours ago. It is a very, very good wicket. Even bit of grass covering, nice and hard and it is a very good batting track," reckon Russel Arnold and Matthew Hayden.21:00 Local Time, 15:00 GMT, 20:30 IST: The official word is that the game has been reduced to 15 overs per side and will begin at 21:30 local time. A bowler can bowl a maximum of 3 overs. The innings break has been reduced to 10 minutes. The coin toss will happen at 21:10.20:55 Local Time, 14:55 GMT, 20:25 IST: The umpires seem to have finished their inspection. Match referee Jeff Crowe is being informed. Awaiting the official word on the start time or the number of overs deducted. "The umpires are having a tough time getting to the captains! First Mashrafe was in a huddle and then Dhoni was playing football. But some message has been passed on to both now," pings Ganesh.20:45 Local Time, 14:45 GMT, 20:15 IST: The umpires are out for an inspection and one of them is having a quick word with MS Dhoni. The super soppers are still going around and the players still doing their football thing.20:30 Local Time, 14:30 GMT, 20:00 IST: Even the hessian cover has been removed and the stumps are being erected. "The pitch is bone dry considering the amount of rain we had," says Russel Arnold. He then moves towards the umpires, who say, "There is a vast improvement in the conditions. The groundstaff are working hard and we are looking forward to having a bigger game. We haven't got the ground in our hands, it is still with the groundsmen. We will have an inspection at 20:45 local time." So from 20:40, we will start losing overs and as said earlier, the cut-off time for a 5-over game is 22:45 local time.20:10 Local Time, 14:10 GMT, 19:40 IST: One can see only the hessian cover on the pitch. There is a lot of water on the covers, which are placed on the side of the square and the groundsmen are working hard to clear them. As said earlier, the drainage here is amazing and the picture looks much better to what it was about an hour ago. I think it is just a matter of how many overs will be docked. Apparently, the umpires will have another look at 20:30 local time. But, we will wait for the official word. "The Indians are out for some warmups. Almost all covers removed now, which is a very good sign," says Ganesh.19:45 Local Time, 13:45 GMT, 19:15 IST: Surprise, surprise, the covers are about to come off. At least a few of them. Feeds more hope to a very appreciable crowd. Rain has STOPPED completely. Wonder how's the outfield coped and how quickly will it dry off? "Doesn't look too bad from a distance. The puddles, which were omnipresent earlier, are not visible. Umpires are out in the centre having a chat with the groundsman," informs Ganesh.19:35 Local Time, 13:35 GMT, 19:05 IST: Ganesh just jumped out of his chair after hearing some huge roars. Oh, the giantscreen is back on. Nothing else. Fans clutching onto everything they find. Still raining. Drop after drop after drop. The intensity of the downpour has eased off allowing a few from the groundstaff and the Indian management to go have a look.19:25 Local Time, 13:25 GMT, 18:55 IST: Pictures coming through from the stadium and it's all very gloomy. Kudos to the crowd for staying put. Most of them have gathered underneath whatever cover is available. Such a shame to be spending a Sunday evening this way after all the hype. But, we are still banking on hope. We'll keep you informed as soon as we have more news. Can't get worse than this.19:10 Local Time, 13:10 GMT, 18:40 IST: The rain is quite steady now and with the wind not blowing across like it was earlier, it is not a great sign one would have to say. Also, the threat of lightning looms. Meanwhile, Ganesh is taking a break from playing weatherman and is thanking his stars for some shelter. Aha, the floodlights are starting to flicker on - three of them are now operational. But what that's done is, it's made the raindrops look even bigger.18:55 Local Time, 12:55 GMT, 18:25 IST: Toss will be delayed, but the good news is that it has reduced a bit now. Remember, the drainage here is very good. So how bad is the condition of the outfield right now? Ganesh tells us that the outfield is battered and has puddles everywhere.18:50 Local Time, 12:50 GMT, 18:20 IST: The floodlights were off a few minutes ago and only one of the towers is on at the moment. "The giant screen looks ragged after the storm," chirps Ganesh.18:40 Local Time, 12:40 GMT, 18:10 IST: This is not looking good. "Claps of thunder and lightning," says Ganesh. It is pouring down as well. The cut-off time for a 5-over game is 22:45 local time. Just as a fact, if there is no game possible, the trophy will be shared. Fingers crossed though! Let's hope that the weather is kind on us.18:30 Local Time, 12:30 GMT, 18:00 IST: I would like to make it clear that there is no reserve day for this game. So let's hope that weather clears soon and allows us to witness at least a shortened game.18:25 Local Time, 12:25 GMT, 17:55 IST: Before going any further, we have some bad news folks. Ganesh Chandrasekaran pings me with this update: "It had stopped raining, but all of a sudden there is a bit of a storm. Some of the advertisement boards from the roof have come off and it happened in a flash. The groundsmen struggled to keep the covers on. Very, very heavy wind and water from the covers are being sprayed everywhere."18:20 Local Time, 12:20 GMT, 17:50 IST: After testing out a few benchwarmers against the UAE, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Ashish Nehra are expected to be back in the playing XI. Overall, Dhoni would want his boys to carry on the good work. These two sides met in the first game of the tournament, but the hosts would want to leave all memories behind. They got to know the importance of the saying "Catches win matches," as Shakib-Al-Hasan's dropped catch of Rohit Sharma hurt them badly. The absence of Mustafizur Rahman is a big blow for them as the youngster has the ability to trouble the batsmen with his bag of tricks.Meanwhile, after his match-winning unbeaten 49 in Sydney, Raina has not managed to score anything substantial. Can both the left-handers hit form before the mega event back home? The biggest plus for India in this campaign is Yuvraj Singh striking them hard and clean. He's not only timing the ball sweetly, but also scoring runs quickly which makes India close to invincible.They couldn't have asked for a better build-up to the World T20. Two three-match bilateral series against Australia and Sri Lanka respectively, followed by the Asia Cup and they have won 9 out of the 10 games. So this tells you that form is not a worry for MS Dhoni and company. The side looks pretty settled, with the captain every now and then stressing about the extra all-round options he has in the side to play with. The only concern for them though is the fact that Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina have not been amongst the runs. Dhawan had a couple of good scores behind him before coming to Bangladesh, but the opener has struggled to put bat on ball in the tourney.18:15 Local Time, 12:15 GMT, 17:45 IST: Before the start of the tournament, they said Bangladesh were not as good a T20 side as they are in the 50-over format. But here they are in the final of the 2016 Asia Cup, ahead of Sri Lanka and Pakistan. A lot of credit has to go to captain Mashrafe Mortaza, who has managed to get the best out of his players. So here is another chance for Bangladesh's fans. We all know how passionate they are in the stands and I am almost sure that it's going to be another boisterous crowd cheering every run and every fielding effort. However, the hosts would be mindful of the fact that they are up against the tournament favourites India. Life is certainly not going to be easy out there, for the Men in Blue have been playing some exceptional T20 cricket.Preview by Ganesh ChandrasekaranThe setting is perfect for an exciting Asia Cup T20, 2016 final on Sunday (March 6). It's fitting that two of the best teams have made it to the final but as Mashrafe Mortaza, the Bangladesh skipper, admitted, India will start the game as favourites thanks to their brilliant run in Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) recently.But Bangladesh will bank on a lot of other factors to favour them. Home conditions for starters. The pitches at the Shere Bangla National stadium in Dhaka were clearly favouring the seamers a lot more when the tournament started. But gradually, that sheen is wearing off although the new-ball still keeps them in the game early on. Bangladesh will be without the services of their premier pacer Mustafizur Rahman (out due to a side strain) but also boast of three others who can make up for his absence on a given day. Taskin Ahmed has started the fill-in role well while Bangladesh also plumped for an extra spinner in the absence of Mustafizur. They are likely to persist with a similar combination for the final as well.The hosts though will be sweating over the fitness of Shakib Al Hasan, who injured his hip-flex area during practice on Friday (March 4). There was nothing serious said the physio, but he also said that it would take 48 hours for him to recover. While he might still pull up fine in time for the final, it might be a risky proposition to push him to play so close to the World T20. Shakib is one of the bedrocks of both, batting and bowling, for Bangladesh and it could be a crucial blow if he does pull up unfit.For India, there aren't any injury concerns at the moment. Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and MS Dhoni, all had niggles at various points during the tournament but have recovered well. Their team combination is public knowledge now with MS Dhoni making no bones about the names or number of pacers, spinners and all-rounders he prefers. The pace-department led by Ashish Nehra and Jasprit Bumrah has been one of their biggest strengths in T20Is recently. The duo has managed to strike in their opening spells in eight out of the last nine games. What it has ensured is that the spinners come in under lesser pressure whenever they have been called upon. Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin have made sure that they operate at the same level so that there is no let-up in pressure.Likewise in the batting department, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been instrumental in ensuring that the middle order enjoys some leeway in most games. One amongst the two have always set up the innings with the rest chipping in. Shikhar Dhawan is yet to make a meaningful contribution in the tournament but has the backing of the team-management to come good. With Yuvraj Singh finding form and Hardik Pandya showcasing his abilities as a power-hitter, the batting looks well-rounded with possible match-winners in every slot.Bangladesh will be wary of the odds stacked against them but as has been repeatedly stressed by both teams, it requires one good spell or innings to win a match in the Twenty20 format. The hosts will be hoping that someone from their team finds that magic patch on Sunday.Backed by what is expected to be a full house, it will reverse the pressure on the Indians. MS Dhoni's men have largely sailed on cruise-mode in this series and have not been put under real pressure often enough. When they have been under the pump, it was either Rohit or Kohli, who has rescued them. The bowling in particular is yet to face a crunch situation. Therein lies an opportunity for the likes of Tamim Iqbal and Sabbir Rahman to try and make a mark. If the new-ball is made to pay, it will put India's bowling in an unfamiliar position.It is well-known that reversing the momentum is probably the most difficult task in T20Is. If Bangladesh's batting can come good early, the crowd-factor could also play up and put India in the unfamiliar territory that they have so far kept away from.Dew is also expected to play a part in the second-half of the innings.
