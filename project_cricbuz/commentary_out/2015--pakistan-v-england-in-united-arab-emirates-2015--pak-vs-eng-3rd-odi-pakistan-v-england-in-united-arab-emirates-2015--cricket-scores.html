Jason Roy is on strike. Irfan will open the attackHello again! Just after the completion of 16th over(during Pakistan's innings ), live visuals singled out a kid among the crowd, who held a placard which said: "I left school early to watch Pakistani fireworks. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case with the bat and let's see if they can produce the same with the ball. Mohammad Irfan, the giant, will startthe proceedings for Pakistan. Two slips in place and "play" says the umpire. Off we go then...The 50-run stand between Hafeez and Sarfraz injected some life but both gifted their wickets in successive overs and it was followed by a hara-kiri from the middle order. Riaz and Gohar chipped in with handy knocks and it was all more of action and drama in the last few overs. More of that coming your way when Englad starts their chase. Stay tuned...Thanks to Wahab Riaz and the 20-year old debutant Zafar Gohar, who both helped Pakistan cross 200. It was an unpredictable and unassuring Pakistan who turned up today and now they find themselves in a spot of bother. Babar Azam's scratchy knock was ended by Woakes' short ball. Skipper Azhar Ali and Hafeez played with good sense of calmness for a brief period. It appeared as if Pakistan are on course to register a mammoth total. However, the wicket of Azhar Ali dented the momentum and England bowlers cashed in with some decent bowling.4
PAKISTAN:49.5 Woakes to Irfan, out Bowled!! Timbahhhh! Woakes lets out his frustration after seeing the bails dislodged and it has been a pleasing show (with the ball) from the visitors.

Riaz was hit in line with middle but the replays show that the ball was sliding down legCan you believe this? Riaz has been given out lbw and he decides to challenge the on-field call. This time there is no inside edge but looks like it was missing the stumps. Oh yeah! It is missing and Riaz is all smiles
PAKISTAN:49.2 Woakes to Riaz, no run, full and tailing in, Riaz gets a big inside edge onto the pad as he tried to flickRiaz is given out but he reviews it straightaway.

PAKISTAN:47.3 Topley to Riaz, 1 run, dropped and it's one of the best fieldsman in the English side. Riaz pulls this back of a length straight to Root at deep square leg who seemed very casual in his effor.

PAKISTAN:47.2 Topley to Riaz, SIX, slower ball on the stumps, Riaz has picked that. Sits back and wallops a mighty hit over wide long-on fence, finally he can afford to smile now

Azhar Ali is on strike. Willey will open the attackThe action is about to begin. The Pakistani openers are out there in the middle. Morgan's troop is also in its position. All set then for this edge-ahead encounter of the ODI series..The visuals show the left-arm spinner Zafar Gohar getting his ODI cap from Rameez Raja. Dan Vettori and Graeme Swann happen to be his cricketing heroes. Hmm. A moment to cherish for sure! Zafar, obviously, greeted it with an ear-to-ear smile.Teams:England (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Reece TopleyPakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Babar Azam, Mohammad Hafeez, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Zafar Gohar, Mohammad IrfanMorgan: "Not much of a focus goes on what is happening in the Pakistani camp. We will try and put in a much better performance. One thing we have developed is that we have. We learn on our feet and adapt to the conditions. No team changes."Azhar: "We will bat first. The pitch has changed a little bit but still a very good pitch to bat on. We will like to put runs on the board. Batsmen should know how much to put on the board. Once we bat, we will realize how much runs to put. Yasir is not playing, Zafar Gohar is making his debut."Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batPitch report: "The outfield is pretty slow. The pitch looks pretty dry. Good signs for the pitch, I think it will be reasonably slow. Significant advantage winning the toss and having a bat first. Small boundaries and a solid looking pitch," reckons Nick Knight with a cheeky smile.England's batting woes were answered by a solid show from their top three batsmen in the previous ODI. More of that will be expected, in this game, from the coaching staff. Not much to complain about their bowling barring Moeen Ali's decline in form with the ball. We'll wait and watch who will turn up and who'll not. More updates on pitch report, toss and team news in a while. Don't go away...And now the action shifts to Sharjah for the third instalment of Pakistan versus England. If it was Hafeez who sunk England with his scintillating ton in the first ODI, it was Hales, in the second ODI, who gave it back and crushed the home team by a huge margin. Pakistan sans Yasir Shah will be just more than a good news for the English batsmen. The 29-year old leggie suffered a knee injury during the practice session and the prospect of him playing this game looks highly unlikely. With that, an extra responsibility will be laid on Pakistan batsmen to put up a much-improved performance. Needless to say that their bowlers need to deliver as well.14:00 Local Time, 10:00 GMT, 15:30 IST: Hello people! Did you hear this? The Australian pace-panther Mitchell Guy Johnson has called time on his international career today morning. Does that excite you? Maybe yes if you're an English fan and I'm pretty sure a few of the England batters can heave a sigh of relief now. No more facing Mitchell Johnson's - perfume-balls, rib-ticklers, toe-crunching yorkers and et al. Elsewhere, rain refused to relent in Bengaluru and hence day 4 of India-South Africa Test match was called off.Preview:Pakistan will be eyeing a decisive series lead as they take on England in the third One Day International (ODI) of the four-match series at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium on Tuesday (November 17).Pakistan are likely to miss the services of Yasir Shah, the highest wicket-taker in the preceding Test series, after the leggie picked up a knee injury during the practice session on the eve of the game.The injury news comes as a setback to Pakistan's hopes given how Yasir's seven for 143 proved decisive in the third Test on the newly laid track at Sharjah earlier this month.After outplaying England in the first ODI for a convincing six-wicket victory in Abu Dhabi, a batting fiasco two days later at the same venue meant the 'hosts' Pakistan threw away their 1-0 lead after folding for a meagre 188 in the chase of 284.Waqar Younis, Pakistan's head coach, has already sounded a word of caution to his team ahead of the crucial tie."We need to play well to make it 2-1", Waqar said, admitting that their complacency costed them the precious series lead."England bounced back and bounced back well. We probably were not thinking that they are going to play that well and now we have to play out of our skins to make it 2-1."The visitors, meanwhile, would be banking on their batting to go 2-1 ahead at Sharjah. The English team management would have heaved a sigh of relief with Alex Hales' match-winning 109 in Abu Dhabi. Jason Roy, the opener and Joe Root, the No. 3 bat, couldn't have timed their half-centuries better after being dismissed for ducks in the series opener.The four-match series is currently tied at 1-1 with the fourth and final match slated to be played in Dubai on November 20.Teams:England (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Reece Topley, Jonny Bairstow, Liam Plunkett, Sam Billings, Chris JordanPakistan (From): Azhar Ali(c), Babar Azam, Mohammad Hafeez, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Irfan, Ahmed Shehzad, Zafar Gohar, Rahat Ali, Aamer Yamin, Bilal AsifLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
