SRI LANKA:19.6 19.6Al-Amin to Kapugedera, no run, the deed is done, Bangladesh have beaten Sri Lanka for the first time in T20Is. A historic moment for them, even if the Sri Lankan Lion is now on the wane. Al-Amin drops in a slower short ball and fools Kapugedera as he swings and misses
SRI LANKA:19.5 Al-Amin to Kapugedera, SIX, yeah, good shot. Only that it's 20-25 balls late. Al-Amin feeds him with a full ball around off, Kapugedera smites a blow over long-off
SRI LANKA:19.4 Al-Amin to Chameera, 1 run, short ball on the stumps, pulled to deep mid-wicketDushmantha Chameera, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:19.3 Al-Amin to Kulasekara, out Caught by Soumya Sarkar!! For once he's missed a yorker, and what happens? He's got another wicket. Falls around six inches short of the mark, Kulasekara sees a mighty loft over long-on, gets enough elevation but he has mishit it off the bottom. Fails to clear the ropes and the catch is smartly gobbled. Kulasekara c Soumya Sarkar b Al-Amin 0(1)Al-Amin to Kulasekara, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:19.2 Al-Amin to Kapugedera, 1 run, my word, mighty impressive death bowling. Yorker after yorker. Kapugedera squeezes it towards long-onNuwan Kulasekara, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:19.1 Al-Amin to Dasun Shanaka, out Caught by Rahim!! Just all formality now. The final ceremonies being played out in a Lankan funeral. Full toss outside off, Shanaka slogs, the bat twists, and he slices it to extra-cover. Dasun Shanaka c Rahim b Al-Amin 14(14) [6s-1]Al-Amin to Dasun Shanaka, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:18.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, four overs, 19 runs, 1 wicket. That caps off Mustafizur's sensational evening. He's bowled the difficult overs mind you. Low full toss which is sliced to extra-cover
SRI LANKA:18.5 Mustafizur Rahman to Dasun Shanaka, no run, how simple is it! Keep running in and churning yorkers. Shanaka tries to put him off his length by moving well across the stumps, and tried to scoop it fine. But Mustafizur is impeccable. Fails to lay bat
SRI LANKA:18.4 Mustafizur Rahman to Kapugedera, 1 run, another booming yorker just outside off, squeezed wide of the bowler towards mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:18.3 Mustafizur Rahman to Kapugedera, 2 runs, that's some work with the wrists but again, no boundary. Fullish around middle and Kapugedera flogs it through mid-wicket but the fielder in the deep moves quickly and cuts it off
SRI LANKA:18.2 Mustafizur Rahman to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, low full toss on middle, drilled to long-on
SRI LANKA:18.1 Mustafizur Rahman to Dasun Shanaka, no run, these Bangladeshi pacers are pulling out yorkers at will, slips in a brisk one well outside off, Shanaka overbalances and tumbles while trying to reach but can't connectBangladesh have this in the bag. If there is any other result today, we would have seen something spectacular
SRI LANKA:17.6 Al-Amin to Kapugedera, no run, hoho, hit that if you can! A nasty toe-crusher on middle, all Kapugedera can do is dig it out
SRI LANKA:17.5 Al-Amin to Kapugedera, 2 runs, walks across and kind of laps a length ball through square leg wide of the deep fielder
SRI LANKA:17.4 Al-Amin to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, couldn't quite get under this slog as it hit high on the bat. Just a single to long-on
SRI LANKA:17.3 Al-Amin to Dasun Shanaka, SIX, woah! That's been hit into outer space. Right into the slot and wooof! Slogs the absolute life out of it over mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:17.2 Al-Amin to Dasun Shanaka, no run, back of a length delivery which bounces more due to the extra effort and flies over the top of Shanaka's wafting willowChamara Kapugedera, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:17.1 Al-Amin to Mathews, out Caught by Shakib!! Mathews is gone and so have Sri Lanka. Surely! Length ball but it's too wide of off, Mathews can only manage to slice it off a thick edge over backward point while swinging hard, the fielder runs back, juggles a couple of times but holds on. Mathews c Shakib b Al-Amin 12(20)Al-Amin to Mathews, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Al-Amin Hossain [2.0-0-17-0] is back into the attack46 from 18 now.
SRI LANKA:16.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Mathews, 1 run, take a bow, Mustafizur! What an over! Only four single off it. Another hard-to-get-under low full toss, jammed down to long-off
SRI LANKA:16.5 Mustafizur Rahman to Mathews, no run, what bowling! Fires it into the blockhole well wide of off. As if his task wasn't difficult enough, Mathews decided to back away even further and completely ruled out a connection
SRI LANKA:16.4 Mustafizur Rahman to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, full ball outside off, driven to sweeper cover
SRI LANKA:16.3 Mustafizur Rahman to Dasun Shanaka, no run, swing and a miss. Length ball angling away just outside off, was there to be heaved away but Shanaka just couldn't connect
SRI LANKA:16.2 Mustafizur Rahman to Mathews, 1 run, mid-on is up in the ring and Mathews kind of decided that he had to get it over him even before the ball was bowled. But Mustafizur smartly speared it fuller and wider. Mathews could only jam it along the ground to the fielder and then took off for a non-existent run. Direct-hit and gone. But no
SRI LANKA:16.1 Mustafizur Rahman to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, short of length ball on middle which is swatted to deep mid-wicket. Shanaka cleared his front leg and struck it well but couldn't find the gapMustafizur Rahman [2.0-0-10-1] is back into the attackIt's Sri Lanka's moment of truth, this over. 50 required from 24. A poor over from their point will seal it.
SRI LANKA:15.6 Shakib to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, flatter outside off, dabbed wide of backward point who dives to stop
SRI LANKA:15.5 Shakib to Mathews, 1 run, shortish outside off, Mathews is still content looking to keep it ticking. Chops it to extra-cover. Something's gotta give

SRI LANKA:15.3 Shakib to Mathews, 1 run, goes deep in the crease and works it through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:15.2 Shakib to Dasun Shanaka, 1 run, slower, flatter and slightly short, spinning away outside off, Shanaka simply flat-bats it down to long-off

SRI LANKA:14.6 Mortaza to Siriwardana, out Caught by S Rahman!! It's all running for Bangladesh. The big-hits are not connecting well, and going to fielders. Looked like another slower ball from Mortaza. Landed on a length just outside off, Siriwardana is into the slog too early and lobs it off the bottom of the bat to deep mid-wicket. Siriwardana c S Rahman b Mortaza 3(4)Mortaza to Siriwardana, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:14.5 Mortaza to Mathews, 1 run, he's trying to be calm here the Lankan skipper. Knocks this into the off-side and takes a single
SRI LANKA:14.4 Mortaza to Mathews, no run, an ugly swing and a miss. Stood there and swished hard at a short of length delivery. It was a slower ball which bounced spongily and over his outside edge
SRI LANKA:14.3 Mortaza to Siriwardana, 1 run, that's just mindless cricket. There's more chaos out there than a fish market. Siriwardana pulls a shortish ball straight to deep square leg, and then wants a second when there isn't one. Came hurtling down more than halfway while Mathews had his back turned. Luckily, the throw was at the wrong end. That too, a wild one
SRI LANKA:14.2 Mortaza to Mathews, 1 run, slower short of length delivery outside off, Mathews drops it with soft hands in front of cover and saunters through for a single
SRI LANKA:14.1 Mortaza to Siriwardana, 1 run, bowls it full outside off and induces a full-blooded swipe from Siriwardana. Only that it was outside his arc and the thick edge flew fine of third man. The fielder ran round and cut it off
SRI LANKA:13.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Mathews, no run, ooof! This stadium is foaming at the mouth. More a gladiator arena than a cricket stadium. What a ball! Leaving the right-hander from a good length, Mathews is squared up looking to defend and beaten by the over the wicket angle
SRI LANKA:13.5 Mustafizur Rahman to Mathews, no run, a crowd catch, nothing else. Harpooned into the blockhole outside off, Mathews digs it into the ground and to the keeper
SRI LANKA:13.4 Mustafizur Rahman to Mathews, 2 runs, looked like another off-cutter from Mustafizur, full on off and Mathews rolls his wrists furiously to whip it behind square for a quick two
SRI LANKA:13.3 Mustafizur Rahman to Siriwardana, 1 run, length ball homing in on off, Siriwardana spears it through the cover regionMilinda Siriwardana, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:13.2 Mustafizur Rahman to T Perera, out Lbw!! Huge roar at the Shere-e-Bangla. Perera, the executioner Perera is gone and Mustafizur has been mobbed by his mates. Full, fast and cannoned in towards middle, Perera is tardy in getting his bat across for the flick, misses and is thudded low on the pad. See you later. T Perera lbw b Mustafizur Rahman 4(6)Mustafizur Rahman to T Perera, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
SRI LANKA:13.1 Mustafizur Rahman to Mathews, 1 run, pats a back of a length delivery in front of cover and sets off for a suicidal run. Direct hit and bye-bye Mathews. Not the caseMustafizur Rahman [1.0-0-6-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:12.6 Mortaza to T Perera, 2 runs, and so nearly a Bangladeshi fielder pulled out the second absolute stunner of the night. Perara is deceived by a slower length ball as he tries to slog and spoons it over short fine leg, Taskin runs back, keeps his eyes on the ball all the time, and then dives with both hands. Pops in and pops out. If that's a dropped chance, then I'm a zombie
SRI LANKA:12.5 Mortaza to Mathews, 1 run, too straight from Mortaza, clipped to square leg
SRI LANKA:12.4 Mortaza to Mathews, no run, back of a length delivery and just outside off, Mathews pushes it to mid-off

SRI LANKA:11.6 Shakib to Mathews, no run, more good fielding and the crowd roar. It was tucked to the left of short mid-wicket who made a diving stop
SRI LANKA:11.5 Shakib to Mathews, no run, tossed up and Mathews drives it straight back at the stumps at the other end
SRI LANKA:11.4 Shakib to T Perera, 1 run, too straight from Shakib, Perera neatly clips it to deep backward square leg

SRI LANKA:11.3 Shakib to Jayasuriya, wide, out Stumped!! Shakib has befuddled Jayasuriya there and that has resulted in his wicket. He enticed the batsman to use his feet by bowling it slower through the air, Jayasuriya charged down the track. But Shakib bowled it wide of off and Jayasuriya could not get any wood on it. Easy stumping for Nurul to effect. Jayasuriya st Nurul Hasan b Shakib 26(21) [4s-1 6s-2]Shakib to Jayasuriya, THAT'S OUT!! Stumped!!
SRI LANKA:11.2 Shakib to Jayasuriya, no run, slower and wide of off, Jayasuriya comes down the track and drives it to cover

SRI LANKA:10.6 Mahmudullah to Chandimal, out Caught by Taskin Ahmed!! Chandimal was looking to play the switch-hit for quite a while. Eventually, he perishes. He was playing some fine lofted strokes and cracking drives. There was no need to go for the switch-hit. Flatter trajectory from Mahmudullah, Chandimal changes his stance and switch-hits it to Taskin at deep backward point who sets under it to grab the catch. Chandimal c Taskin Ahmed b Mahmudullah 37(37) [4s-4]Mahmudullah to Chandimal, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

SRI LANKA:10.3 Mahmudullah to Jayasuriya, no run, slower through the air and outside off, Jayasuriya tries to dab it around the corner and misses. He lost his balance there, but in the end, no harm done
SRI LANKA:10.2 Mahmudullah to Jayasuriya, SIX, now that was a meaty blow. The thwack of the leather against the willow gives an inkling that came right off the screws. Jayasuriya charges down the track and lofts a tossed up delivery wide of long-off for a maximum
SRI LANKA:10.1 Mahmudullah to Chandimal, 1 run, pushed through from Mahmudullah, Chandimal sinks on one knee and sweeps it to deep backward square le

The batsmen at the striker's end was well in when the keeper whipped the bails off. Easy decision for the umpire to make.

SRI LANKA:9.2 Shakib to Chandimal, 2 runs, Chandimal charges down the track to a tossed up delivery and gets a thickish outside edge to deep backward point for a brace. Chandimal was lucky there

SRI LANKA:8.6 Mahmudullah to Chandimal, no run, the keeper is again excited. He appeals for an LBW, but the umpire gives a deaf ear to it. Chandimal attempted a switch-hit to a flatter delivery that was sliding down leg and missed. It likely would have gone on to miss the leg-stump
SRI LANKA:8.5 Mahmudullah to Chandimal, no run, flatter trajectory and on the stumps, Chandimal cuts it to cover
SRI LANKA:8.4 Mahmudullah to Jayasuriya, 1 run, from round the wicket, Mahmudullah entices the drive by bowling it wide of off, Jayasuriya slices it square on the off-side. It was in the air for a while, but no damage done

SRI LANKA:8.2 Mahmudullah to Chandimal, 2 runs, Chandimal camps back and cuts this flatter delivery through the cover-region. Good running between the wickets help the pair to add two more runs to the bag
SRI LANKA:8.1 Mahmudullah to Chandimal, no run, slightly shorter in length, Chandimal aims to cut and the ball vrooms past the edge. Muted appeal from the keeper for a caught behind, but rightly turned downMahmudullah, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:7.6 Taskin Ahmed to Jayasuriya, no run, back of a length delivery and Taskin hits the bat hard, Jayasuriya with soft hands defends it back down the pitch and aims to nab a quick single. However, in the end, rightly sent back by his partner
SRI LANKA:7.5 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, 1 run, another one that is slanted into the right-hander, Chandimal uses the pace of the bowler and dabs it to third man
SRI LANKA:7.4 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, back of a length delivery that is angled in, Chandimal flays the cut towards the backward point point fielder and it lands just in front of him. Taskin has his hands on his head in sheer despair

SRI LANKA:6.5 Mortaza to Jayasuriya, no run, off-pace delivery on middle and leg is turned to mid-wicket. Is desperate for a run but sees the mid-wicket swoop on the ball and aborts the ambitious run
SRI LANKA:6.4 Mortaza to Chandimal, 1 run, width's the chef's special of the day and it's being steered down to third man for milky singles at the moment
SRI LANKA:6.3 Mortaza to Jayasuriya, 1 run, holds his bat close to his pad and directs this ball to third man with an open blade
SRI LANKA:6.2 Mortaza to Chandimal, 1 run, stylishly lifts his front leg in air and pulls it through square leg, like a pirouette in ballet
SRI LANKA:6.1 Mortaza to Chandimal, FOUR, not ideal. Short and wide at a passenger train's pace, Chandimal stands tall and fierces the cut over backward pointMashrafe Mortaza, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackSlip is unpopulated for Mortaza
SRI LANKA:5.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Chandimal, 1 run, rolls his fingers on this delivery, extra bounce and Chandimal is nearly caught again. Okay, I am over-egging that. Too wide of the slip. Chandimal did well to ride the bounce but had his bat face closed, off the leading edge and wide of the lone slipperThere's obviously a slip in place
SRI LANKA:5.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Chandimal, wide, bumper that hits the trampoline. Keeps rising and goes way over the head of a ducking Chandimal
SRI LANKA:5.5 Mustafizur Rahman to Chandimal, no run, goes full inviting the drive. Chandimal RSVPs with a wild drive but arrives late. Ends up swishing thin air
SRI LANKA:5.4 Mustafizur Rahman to Chandimal, no run, on a length and Chandimal nicely gets behind this one and bunts it to one of the off-ring guarders
SRI LANKA:5.3 Mustafizur Rahman to Chandimal, no run, taken? Keeper dives in front of him and the ball just dropped in front of him. This was the patented slower delivery angled across, Chandimal wanted to run it down to third man. Feathers it back off the outside edge and the ball was always dying. These slower balls are too good for anyone on the ground. Umpire wanted to check with the square leg umpire but the keeper immediately signaled that it didn't carry
SRI LANKA:5.2 Mustafizur Rahman to Chandimal, FOUR, deliciously pitches this up wide of off, Chandimal gets low and squeezes out the drive through backward point. Off the outside edge and the third man's dive isn't fast enough
SRI LANKA:5.1 Mustafizur Rahman to Chandimal, no run, length on leg-stump, extracted some extra bounce and Chandimal splices the defence back down the pitchMustafizur Rahman, comes into the attackHere's the Superstar... over the wicket
SRI LANKA:4.6 Al-Amin to Chandimal, 1 run, looked tangled as he crossed his bat in front of his pad to push this ball to mid-on
SRI LANKA:4.5 Al-Amin to Chandimal, FOUR, half-deliberate that. Short ball rising outside off, Chandimal looked cramped as he lifted his bat to upper-cut/upper-dab it to third man. Off the outside edge and it runs periliously close to the wicket-keeper
SRI LANKA:4.4 Al-Amin to Jayasuriya, 1 run, a dive at mid-off to intercept this punch from Jayasuriya. Bangladesh's fielding resembles a sine curve - magnificent one moment and then mediocre the next
SRI LANKA:4.3 Al-Amin to Jayasuriya, no run, now a little stutter. Dabbed it to backward point and tries to run a single. Sanely turned down by Chandimal and could make it back in
SRI LANKA:4.2 Al-Amin to Jayasuriya, SIX, that's hit disdainfully down the ground. Dances down the ground, takes this back of a length delivery on the up and lofts it down the ground for a maximum
SRI LANKA:4.1 Al-Amin to Jayasuriya, no run, back of a length delivery speared in, Jayasuriya slides back and digs it into the pitch with a high batAl-Amin Hossain [1.0-0-5-0] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:3.4 Shakib to Jayasuriya, FOUR, fabulous shot! Puts his skates on and digests all the flight with a flogging drive through extra cover
SRI LANKA:3.3 Shakib to Jayasuriya, no run, there's flight on the Shakib menu today. turning in just a touch and Jayasuriya bunts it back
SRI LANKA:3.2 Shakib to Chandimal, 1 run, teasingly slow through the air, turns a touch. Chandimal stands taller and open-bats it past slip for a quick singleShehan Jayasuriya, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:3.1 Shakib to Dilshan, out Caught by Soumya Sarkar!! What a stunning catch and Rameez Raja is wowing on air. Tossed up first up, Dilshan used his feet to set the tone. No where off the middle and the ball was cued high wide of mid-off. Soumya turned around and ran to his right, extended his hands to grab it and topped it with a slide to hold onto the ball and celebrate. Top effort and Dilshan's poor run keeps rubbering on. Dilshan c Soumya Sarkar b Shakib 12(9) [4s-2]Shakib to Dilshan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Shakib Al Hasan, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:2.6 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, makes just a bit of room and carves it out to pointFlying start?
SRI LANKA:2.5 Taskin Ahmed to Dilshan, 1 run, goes fuller this time and powers it with an angle in, Dilshan eases it to extra cover and runs through
SRI LANKA:2.4 Taskin Ahmed to Dilshan, FOUR, no one moved. Back-of-the-hand slower delivery, on a length and Dilshan just protracts his hands to flash it through point
SRI LANKA:2.3 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, 1 run, taps this ball to short cover and runs through. Shakib flings himself forward with a throw at the bowler's end, misses but Chandimal was well in
SRI LANKA:2.2 Taskin Ahmed to Dilshan, 1 run, bunts the length ball to point and steals a quick single
SRI LANKA:2.1 Taskin Ahmed to Dilshan, FOUR, that's crunched like the Dilshan of the old. Gets over this length and pulls it through long-on. Vivian Richards like swagger there
SRI LANKA:1.6 Al-Amin to Dilshan, 1 run, oh, Leverock'd that catch nearly! Remember THAT catch in the 2007 WC? Difficult catch, has to be. Stays his ground and looks to punch this ball through cover. Ball ducks out, takes the outside edge and goes just wide of the slip who flung to his right with his hand stuck out but it was just a bit wide. Mahmudullah got a hand but it didn't stick
SRI LANKA:1.5 Al-Amin to Dilshan, no run, straight to backward square leg. Gets hold of this short delivery outside off, rolls his wrists but can get the ball only as far as the only fielder he should have got it past
SRI LANKA:1.4 Al-Amin to Chandimal, 1 run, plonks out a big front foot stride and pushes the ball open-batted to third man
SRI LANKA:1.3 Al-Amin to Chandimal, 2 runs, length ball veering in on the pad, Chandimal bent a touch, let the ball come in and turned it round the corner for a brace. A Mortaza fumble allows a couple

SRI LANKA:1.1 Al-Amin to Dilshan, no run, back of a length just outside off, Dilshan gets high inside his crease and blunts it backAl-Amin Hossain, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:0.6 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, FOUR, there was a bit of tailoring and just a bit of Maradona in that. Shortish ball sliced past second slip, rather teasingly after that drop. Third man runs across and nearly cuts it off with his boot. Couldn't take off the momentum, imparts it ironically as his left boot's stop was ruined by a right boot kick
SRI LANKA:0.5 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, speared in from wide of the crease, Chandimal lets this ball come onto him and then bunts it close to his body
SRI LANKA:0.4 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, oh! Now stoops and goes for the drive to this full ball. Late swing and Chandimal comes out as second best again
SRI LANKA:0.3 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, and a ripper. On back of a length and jagging in off the seam, Chandimal pushes at it and sees the ball whistle past the outside edge
SRI LANKA:0.2 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, edged and dropped! Soumya Sarkar at second slip has an ugly pointer on his Asia Cup resume. Bends low in front of him to collect this outside edge off the flat-footed poke, goes with hard hands and shells it. Went for the rebound too but not good enough
SRI LANKA:0.1 Taskin Ahmed to Chandimal, no run, length delivery curling in late and whooshing past Chandimal's open bat face held aloftChandimal and Dilshan are at the crease. Chandimal is on strike. Taskin Ahmed will open the attackAfter a confident-looking huddle, the players walk out. The task is mighty for the hosts, with about a par score to defend on a pitch that lacks the vegetation that BCB's so interested in of late. The Sri Lankan openers trace them onto the field. Dilshan (who averages 15 in his last 5 innings) will look to hop back into the form chariot ahead of the T20 WC. Can this be the match? 10..9..8....3..2..1. Taskin has the ball, two slipsShakib: "I thought the ball was coming on nicely. We are happy with the total given the start. 160 would have been good. I knew I needed to bat the overs and wanted to see before the last 5 overs. One of his (Sabbir Rahman's) best innings and that helped us get to this total. Credit to him and now we have to bowl and field well. It's just a par score and the ball's gripping. So the spinners are in the game and we just have to get some early wickets to be in the game."After posting his fifty in 38 deliveries, Rahman smashed the opposition to smithereens. He was eventually dismissed for a 54-ball 80. Shakib Al Hasan played the supporting role to perfection. Initially, he did struggle for timing and placement, but pinched singles and twos to rotate the strike. With their pyrotechnics, Shakib and Mahmudullah then, thumped a few sparkling shots in the slog overs. For Sri Lanka, Kulasekara and Mathews swung the new ball. However, once the ball got older, Kulasekara looked short of ideas. Dushmantha Chameera though, impressed with raw pace and snared three wickets. The track is good for batting and the dew factor might come into play. But Sri Lanka need to up their game, if they want to hunt down the target. Join us in a few minutes for Sri Lanka's innings...Sabbir Rahman unfurled a series of blazing shots to lit up the proceedings and put the hosts in a position of strength. In fact, Bangladesh were off to a disastrous start as the tourists whittled away at the line-up to pick up scalps up front. It was in the fourth over that Rahman decided to take the aggressive route by slamming three fours and a six. 1
BANGLADESH:19.6 Chameera to Mahmudullah, out Mortaza Run Out!! 2 runs completed. Out last ball but they were rightly trying to steal a third. Mahmudullah walked across his stumps and lofted it awkwardly over cover. Pushed hard for the second and a bit of lethargy in the deep meant that a third was on. Mortaza was intent but Mahmudullah was ball-watching. Was late and that turned off Mortaza too. Took off late and was found short courtesy Chandimal's Dhoni-like bail flicking. 147 on the board and that's decent when your openers have been ducked back into the pavilion. Mortaza run out (Shanaka/Chandimal) 2(2)Chameera to Mahmudullah, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!Run out? All drama
BANGLADESH:19.5 Chameera to Mortaza, byes, 1 run, full delivery swinging away, Mortaza backs away for a clobber over the cow corner. Movement beats him, Mortaza runs and the keeper couldn't cut the run short despite a direct-hit at the striker's end
BANGLADESH:19.4 Chameera to Mortaza, 2 runs, and a couple again. Under-edged the cut back to the keeper who runs across and dives but couldn't get to the ball. Third man fires in the throw, enough time for a couple and Mahmudullah stays away from the strike
BANGLADESH:19.3 Chameera to Mahmudullah, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, Mahmudullah shuffles and drags the heave to long-on. Only a single and the strike's gone too
BANGLADESH:19.3 Chameera to Mahmudullah, wide, overdoes the bowl-wide-and-out-of-reach ploy and umpire stretches armsMashrafe Mortaza, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:19.2 Chameera to Nurul Hasan, out Caught by Mathews!! Slower ball outside off, Nurul Hasan plonked his front leg and looked to go big over square leg. Ball arrived slowly, took the leading-edge and lobbed to extra cover for the simplest of catches. More importantly, Mahmudullah will have the strike. Nurul Hasan c Mathews b Chameera 2(5)Chameera to Nurul Hasan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
BANGLADESH:19.1 Chameera to Mahmudullah, 1 run, a missed run out! Bowls this full outside off, Mahmudullah protracts hands to tap it and hints at a run. Chameera runs across and cuts it off at short cover, fires a throw at striker's end but misses it completely. Batsmen then had time to run two but looked too shellshockedA much needed 14-run over this. Chameera will bowl the last over. Where's your seat belt?
BANGLADESH:18.6 Kulasekara to Nurul Hasan, no run, skips out and sort of yorks himself. Adjusts and just manages to dig it out
BANGLADESH:18.5 Kulasekara to Mahmudullah, 1 run, flashes a wide length ball through cover and hurries to complete an urgent single
BANGLADESH:18.4 Kulasekara to Mahmudullah, SIX, gets under this fullish ball and murders it down the ground. Flushes all his gymnasium workout into his bat flow and times it into the stands
BANGLADESH:18.3 Kulasekara to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, too action packed. Drills a fullish ball back to Kulasekara as his bat turned. Kulasekara stuck his hand up to catch but tipped it away. Perera at mid-off let out a poor throw at the bowler's end and the batsmen sneak in a runSo, 5 runs off the first two balls
BANGLADESH:18.2 Kulasekara to Mahmudullah, FOUR, if you'd ask me to slash a Mahogany, I would do that too. Slower delivery that's not too good to deceive. Mahmudullah widens his stance as he makes room and swats it over mid-wicket with a swivel. One bounce and over the ropes
BANGLADESH:18.1 Kulasekara to Nurul Hasan, 1 run, arches towards off with flat feet and taps it to cover-point to hand Mahmudullah the strikeWhat a lovely over that. Miserly. Just 6 runs. Over to Kulasekara
BANGLADESH:17.6 Chameera to Nurul Hasan, 1 run, cheeky but could have looked foolish had it been taken at third man. Scooped this fullish ball with a shuffle, not off the middle and it went on the bounce to an on-rushing third man. Survives despite the circus
BANGLADESH:17.5 Chameera to Nurul Hasan, no run, slower, quicker, slower, quicker and deceived. Pacy back of a length back-bender outside off, Nurul is drawn into the poke, fishes and is beaten
BANGLADESH:17.4 Chameera to Mahmudullah, 1 run, basically looped on a short of length outside off, width to cut but the off-pace deliveries often rob all the timing. Chopped back to the keeper
BANGLADESH:17.3 Chameera to Mahmudullah, no run, gets a slower delivery to jag away with the seam, Mahmudullah stays put and pokes at it. BeatenNurul Hasan, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:17.2 Chameera to Shakib, out Caught by Chandimal!! And he's bulldozed Shakib out. Fires in the bouncer thrusted with pace, Shakib was hurried on the pull. Still went on as he hid his face looking to duck, pulls it onto his helmet and the ball lobs to the keeper behind. Chameera had his arms aloft running Shoaib-esquely even before Chandimal could latch onto it. Big wicket. Shakib c Chandimal b Chameera 32(34) [4s-3]Chameera to Shakib, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
BANGLADESH:17.1 Chameera to Shakib, FOUR, Jayasuriya at cover was momentarily interested but just evaded him. Shakib shimmied a touch and drove it on-the-up. Didn't bother to keep it down and riding on some luck, it sped awayThree overs...30 runs? Mahmudullah and Shakib can hit big, mind you. Chameera will continue
BANGLADESH:16.6 Kulasekara to Mahmudullah, no run, gets the yorker spot on this time and it's been jammed back to Kulasekara
BANGLADESH:16.5 Kulasekara to Mahmudullah, FOUR, even these near yorker length deliveries aren't safe. Full and Mahmudullah stayed his ground, met it with Warney's wrists and flicks it uppishly over square leg
BANGLADESH:16.4 Kulasekara to Shakib, 1 run, length delivery outside off, Shakib stayed put and punches it to long-on with a slightly closed bat face
BANGLADESH:16.3 Kulasekara to Mahmudullah, 1 run, gentle leg-cutter outside off, Mahmudullah lets it turn away and dabs it to short third man for a quick single
BANGLADESH:16.2 Kulasekara to Shakib, 1 run, pushes this delivery to extra cover and gets to the other end. Mahmudullah has the strike
BANGLADESH:16.1 Kulasekara to Shakib, FOUR, round the wicket, slower from back-of-the-hand outside off, Shakib got low and fetched it with a sweep. Almost turned square and placed it through square legNuwan Kulasekara [2.0-0-19-1] is back into the attackMahmudullah, right handed bat, comes to the creaseNo century for Rahman but he departed for his highest T20I score
BANGLADESH:15.6 Chameera to S Rahman, out Caught by Jayasuriya!! And he perishes. What an anti-climax this. The shot was on. Fuller delivery robbed of pace outside off, Rahman stooped to fetch it with a slog sweep. Seemed to have connected it well but finds the deep mid-wicket spot on. Hunches and digests the ball in his palms. Talk about placement but the slowness of the delivery has finally gobbled him up. S Rahman c Jayasuriya b Chameera 80(54) [4s-10 6s-3]Chameera to S Rahman, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
BANGLADESH:15.5 Chameera to S Rahman, SIX, if there's ever an assassination, this is it. Slower bouncer but Rahman spots it like a hawk. Stands taller, swipes the air and hooks it out of the ground over cow corner
BANGLADESH:15.5 Chameera to S Rahman, wide, another wide but this was thrusted with lots of pace following this slower delivery. 144ks. Short of a length and veering away, Rahman attempted the slap but way too wide
BANGLADESH:15.4 Chameera to S Rahman, no run, another slower delivery on back of a length, Rahman swings across the line only to be deceived by the pace for the nth time
BANGLADESH:15.3 Chameera to Shakib, 1 run, guides this full ball with an open bat face to third man

BANGLADESH:15.2 Chameera to S Rahman, no ball, 1 run, it's a free-hit! Steps over the line, by a big margin, in delivering this low full toss outside off that's heaved to deep mid-wicketThe crowd is buzzing
BANGLADESH:15.1 Chameera to Shakib, 1 run, back of a length delivery wide of off, Shakib throws his hands at it and manages to slice it to third man for a single
BANGLADESH:14.6 Herath to S Rahman, FOUR, shot! They just keep coming, don't they? Flighted delivery on middle, Rahman shimmies down and barrels it down the ground. Through Herath who bent low to field but it sped away
BANGLADESH:14.5 Herath to S Rahman, no run, ambitious sweep to this delivery veering down, is late and gloved it back onto the pitch
BANGLADESH:14.4 Herath to Shakib, 1 run, the line's leg-stumpish, Shakib shuffles again to get behind and lofts it down the ground to long-on

BANGLADESH:13.3 Chameera to S Rahman, 1 run, swatted down to long-on. Not short enough to pull and hurried to hit Rahman's bat, rather than the other way round
BANGLADESH:13.2 Chameera to S Rahman, no run, excellent riposte. Slows the pace right down, Rahman was already through with the slog. Also, the slower ball meant it bounced a lot less and sneaked beneath his swinging willow to the keeper
BANGLADESH:13.1 Chameera to S Rahman, FOUR, he has murdered that. Chameera would be wise to just turn back and walk to the top of his mark. Cleared the front leg to a fullish ball outside off and rammed it through extra-coverDushmantha Chameera, right-arm fast, comes into the attack
BANGLADESH:12.6 Jayasuriya to Shakib, no run, another very full ball cannoned towards middle, Shakib manages to squeeze it back down
BANGLADESH:12.5 Jayasuriya to S Rahman, 1 run, fires in a yorker and is drilled down to long-on
BANGLADESH:12.4 Jayasuriya to S Rahman, 2 runs, the crowd is roaring behind Rahman here as he sprints back for a couple. Knew exactly how softly he had nudged it through the vacant mid-wicket region and hared back
BANGLADESH:12.3 Jayasuriya to S Rahman, FOUR, aww, look at that racing away. Sliding on with the arm outside off, Rahman simply leans into the drive and threads it past extra-cover. Sped away
BANGLADESH:12.2 Jayasuriya to S Rahman, FOUR, no two ways about this one. A drag down on the stumps, Rahman rocks back and swats the pull through mid-wicket
BANGLADESH:12.1 Jayasuriya to S Rahman, SIX, in the air, deep mid-wicket is interested, he thinks he has it covered. But he's tipped it over the ropes. Fifty up for Rahman too. Saw the length, saw the opportunity and swiped it hard with a slog-sweep. Don't think he got all on it. The fielder who was Kapu came hurtling to his right, stuck both arms overhead but could only manage fingertipsShehan Jayasuriya [2.0-0-4-0] is back into the attack
BANGLADESH:11.6 Herath to S Rahman, 1 run, a couple of excited screams from the bowler and keeper as Rahman nearly yorked himself after a shimmy, but managed to get the bat down in time and squeeze it into the off-side
BANGLADESH:11.5 Herath to Shakib, 1 run, takes a step or two down the pitch, takes it on the full and laces it down to long-off
BANGLADESH:11.4 Herath to S Rahman, 1 run, almost lands in the blockhole and is squeezed through mid-wicket
BANGLADESH:11.3 Herath to S Rahman, no run, Herath has laid out a beaut and left Rahman looking a bit green here. Looped it up judiciously above the eyeline, got it to dip on a length while angling in on off, then ripped away past the outside edge as Rahman tries to work it through mid-wicket

BANGLADESH:10.3 Dilshan to Shakib, 1 run, he's flirting with danger, is Dilshan. All 3 of his balls have been absolute filth. Short again outside off, slapped to sweeper cover
BANGLADESH:10.2 Dilshan to Shakib, 2 runs, drops it slightly short outside off and is slapped square of the wicket, making sweeper cover rush to his right and slide to stop. Enough time to nick a couple
BANGLADESH:10.1 Dilshan to S Rahman, 1 run, that tells you all of Dilshan's intentions right there. Comes in and fires it down leg first ball. Rahman glances it to short fine legTillakaratne Dilshan, right-arm off break, comes into the attac

BANGLADESH:9.2 Herath to Shakib, 1 run, teased up on leg, whipped to long-on
BANGLADESH:9.1 Herath to Shakib, no run, pushed through quicker and sliding on just outside off, Shakib tries an encore of the late-cut of the previous over but plays underneath the ball this time. Beaten
BANGLADESH:8.6 Jayasuriya to S Rahman, no run, flatter and quicker outside off, beaten for pace on the cut and can't connect
BANGLADESH:8.5 Jayasuriya to S Rahman, no run, now that's what happens when you premeditate. Chose the worst ball to be reverse-sweeping. Fired in the blockhole outside off, no way he could connect
BANGLADESH:8.4 Jayasuriya to S Rahman, no run, not all that short to be cutting, also cramps Rahman for room and he mistimes it to cover
BANGLADESH:8.3 Jayasuriya to S Rahman, no run, it's pushed quicker through the air outside off, lots of overspin imparted due to which it kicks up and bounces over Rahman's bat as he tries to sweep it hard

BANGLADESH:7.6 Herath to Shakib, 1 run, tossed up outside off, driven to long-off
BANGLADESH:7.5 Herath to Shakib, FOUR, ah, lovely. Went right back in the crease and created his own length there. Not all that short but the room was there. Then brings the bat down late and back cuts it behind backward point
BANGLADESH:7.4 Herath to S Rahman, 1 run, uses the feet to get close to the ball and whips it down to long-on
BANGLADESH:7.3 Herath to S Rahman, no run, oooh, grip and turn. Lots of generosity from Herath in flight. But cleverly pulled the length back. Stuck in the pitch and turned from middle but Rahman did well to not commit early and played it back

BANGLADESH:7.1 Herath to S Rahman, 1 run, slowish arm-ball skidding down leg, Rahman moves with the ball and glances it wide of short fine leg who moves across quickly and tumbles to stopRangana Herath, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack

BANGLADESH:5.5 T Perera to S Rahman, FOUR, Rahman is in that mood where the cricket ball comes across as a football. He rocks back to a shortish delivery and nails the pull to the mid-wicket boundary. Now, it scurried past motionless fielders
BANGLADESH:5.4 T Perera to S Rahman, FOUR, now that was a crunchy stroke by Rahman. Fuller length delivery and just outside off, Rahman drills it past the mid-off fielder and the ball zooms into the fence
BANGLADESH:5.3 T Perera to S Rahman, FOUR, well, this can turn out to be Rahman 's day. He gets lucky there. Another short of length delivery that was angled in, Rahman aims to pull, but he got into a terrible position to play that stroke. Eventually, outside edged it over the keeper for a boundary

BANGLADESH:4.5 Mathews to Rahim, out Rahim Run Out!! Well, that is one terrible mix-up which has resulted in Rahim's run out. The crowd has gone silent for the moment. Rahim pushed a back of a length delivery that was angled in to short cover and straightaway aimed at nabbing a quick single. It felt as if the partner responded and then stopped. By then Rahim was halfway down the pitch. Mathews, with athletic strides, swooped down on the ball quickly, picked it up and broke the stumps. Rahim was nowhere in the picture. Rahim run out (Mathews) 4(9)Mathews to Rahim, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!

BANGLADESH:3.4 Kulasekara to S Rahman, FOUR, this time width on offer, Rahman blazes the cut and it catapults to the square third man boundary. This is exhilarating stuff from Rahman

BANGLADESH:3.2 Kulasekara to S Rahman, SIX, Rahman continues to play with a touch of bravado. He shuffles across the sticks as he expects Kulasekara to slant it back into the right-hander and then heaves it over the deep mid-wicket boundary. It cleared the rope quite easily
BANGLADESH:3.1 Kulasekara to S Rahman, FOUR, Rahman cracks the first boundary for the hosts. Much needed boundary for them. Fullish delivery that was angled in, Rahman whips it across the line after shuffling across and the ball scurries to the deep mid-wicket fence
BANGLADESH:2.6 Mathews to Rahim, 2 runs, well, Bangladesh were close to losing another wicket there. But Rahim escapes.

BANGLADESH:1.3 Kulasekara to Soumya Sarkar, out Caught by Mathews!! Another one bites the dust. Bangladesh are already in a spot of bother. Sarkar closed the bat face too early to a delivery that veered away from Sarkar a touch as he looked to heave it across the line. But he got a leading edge that flew towards Mathews at mid-off, who clasped it with both hands. The Sri Lankan camp is delighted for sure. Soumya Sarkar c Mathews b Kulasekara 0(3)Kulasekara to Soumya Sarkar, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

BANGLADESH:0.2 Mathews to Mithun, out Lbw!! Well, the canny manipulator of the ball has landed a blow straightaway. With subtle changes of wrist he has that uncanny ability to swing it both ways. First up, he bowled the away-swinger and then followed it with an inswinger. Mathews gets it to veer back into the right-hander, Mithun comes half forward and tries to keep it out, but is beaten on the inside edge and is trapped in front. On expected lines, the umpire answers the appeal in the affirmative. On replays, it showed that the ball was hitting top of the middle-stump. Mithun lbw b Mathews 0(2)Mathews to Mithun, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
BANGLADESH:0.1 Mathews to Mithun, no run, gentle away-swing on this good length delivery for Mathews, Mithun hangs his bat outside off and is beatenMithun and Soumya Sarkar are at the crease. Mithun is on strike. Mathews will open the attackAfter a customary huddle, Sri Lanka's fielders have taken their positions. Mathews has the new nut in his hand. With just a tilt of the wrist, he will look to swing it both ways. The canny manipulator of the ball has a lone slip in place. We are ready to go...Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Nurul Hasan(w), Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahman, Mohammad Mithun, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Al-Amin HossainSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Shehan Jayasuriya, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Dasun Shanaka, Nuwan Kulasekara, Thisara Perera, Rangana Herath, Dushmantha ChameeraMathews: Malinga is unfit and won't play today. Hopefully, we can have him for crunch games. In the last game, we did not do that well. Hopefully, we can pick our game today. The wicket really looks like a good track for batting. Malinga misses out and Thisara Perera comes inMortaza: We will bat first. The track does not seem to have much grass. In the earlier matches, there was a decent covering of grass. Hopefully, we can get a good total. It depends on dew as well. It is a pressure game and hopefully, we can cope with it. We are playing with the same teamBangladesh have won the toss and have opted to batPitch report: This track should assist the spinners more. There is still a bit of live grass, but they have shaven most of it. It might help the spinners and be good for batting, too, reckon Rameez Raja and Athar Ali KhanBreaking news: Lasith Malinga is not playing as he is down with a knee injury. Angelo Mathews will captain the Sri Lankan sideHowever, Bangladesh will be a touch worried with the middle-order batsmen losing the plot against UAE. It needed Mahmudullah to play with tactical nous and deliberation to shore up the innings. Their opponents, Sri Lanka, have not exactly hit top form in recent times. Even in the game against UAE, Sri Lanka's players seemed to have queasy stomachs, as they could only muster a decent total. But their bowlers bailed them out. Amidst the doom and gloom, Chandimal's fifty against UAE should lift the spirits of the Sri Lankan unit. The onus also will be on Dilshan, Mathews, Kulasekara, Malinga and the exciting young quick, Chameera to stamp their authority. We will have the toss and teams in a few minutes ...After a disappointing loss to India, Bangladesh's fans had a lot to cheer about when the home team brushed aside the challenge of UAE. Bangladesh's out-cricket bristled with energy and purpose. It was the troika of Mustafizur, Al Amin and Mortaza who picked up the key scalps. The spinners, too, bowled with discipline. With the track again expected to help the pacers, they will hope the four fast bowlers can continue their good work against a batting line-up that appears slightly creaky on paper. Among the batsmen, Mohammad Mithun will be expected to provide the ballast at the top of the order.In the backdrop of countless hooting and honking by the fans at the Shere Bangla National Stadium, Dhaka, India usurped their arch-rivals Pakistan in an intense battle to liven up the tournament. Today, the hosts, Bangladesh, will also look to put up a slick performance as they aim to trip Sri Lanka and carry their winning momentum forward.Preview by Ganesh ChandrasekaranFour games into the Asia Cup 2016 and we are yet to see the big-hitters take the centre stage. This Twenty20 tournament has been a far cry from the norm in the format - not that it has failed to produce compelling cricket. One could even stretch the argument further to perhaps point out that this tournament has given the format itself a different colour. The primary reason for this has been the pitches produced. With more than a tinge of green on all the surfaces so far, teams will be revisiting their playing XI and even strategies to counter this factor.Both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have enough resources in their ranks to counter it, in the likely situation that the conditions remain the same. Bangladesh's four pacers - Mashrafe Mortaza, Mustafizur Rahman, Taskin Ahmed and Al-Amin Hossain - are fast gaining in reputation and will be more than a handful in helpful conditions, as they showed in the game against the United Arab Emirates. Their batting has been the bigger worry with failures in first two games. One of their key members in the unit - Shakib Al Hasan - has a high score of just 20 in his last nine T20I innings. That will be the biggest worry for the skipper. Shakib's failures gain more prominence in the absence of Tamim Iqbal in the line-up. The rest of the batting unit will not find it any easier against Sri Lanka and if Bangladesh are to show any improvement in this format, it is once again Shakib's responsibility to show them the way forward. The think-tank would also be pondering the need to shuffle the batting order a touch to adapt to the conditions. Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim will probably be of more value to them higher up in the order in these conditions. The bowling unit is far more settled and it's unlikely it'll see a change for this gameSri Lanka will be sweating upon the fitness of Lasith Malinga, who presented a grim outlook after bowling in the match against UAE. Malinga was playing his first game in four months after a knee injury kept him out and did not seem to happy at the end of that game despite picking up a match-winning four-wicket haul. Sri Lanka will be treading cautiously on his fitness and availability for the rest of the tournament since their aim would be to keep Malinga fit for the World T20. Their other worry will be the batting department, which much like Bangladesh, came a cropper against UAE.That time around, the batsmen were simply not prepared for a pitch like that in Bangladesh but if faced with a similar situation, they will be prepared to counter it. Sri Lanka preferred to use Dinesh Chandimal as an opener in that game and he promptly responded with an important half-century. That knock should help him hold the spot for a longer period now. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Angelo Mathews are the other two bedrocks of the batting unit which also consists of a few explosive hitters. Their well-rounded batting department might well be the clincher against Bangladesh with both bowling units at par, given the conditions at play.It is unlikely that either team will make any changes to their playing XI unless injury-enforced. For Bangladesh, with a loss already in their first game against India, this game will be of bigger significance. Their batsmen will fancy their chances a little more against Sri Lanka than they would do so against Pakistan, given their display against India. A loss here will hamper their situation further. On the other hand, Sri Lanka will be gunning for a spot at the top of the table with a second successive win.The toss-up eventually might be between just the two bowling units of the sides. On paper, there is not much that can separate the two. Sri Lanka though go in with the edge because of a more experienced batting group. The spotlight will naturally be on the new-ball bowlers and openers of both teams. They are the ones who will set the tone, and on a greenish pitch they gain even more importance. The changes in strategy will also be tactical. There might not be a slam-bang approach from the openers. They are likely to slip into a more old-fashioned role of setting up the base for the middle order to cash in during the latter half of the innings.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Dinesh Chandimal(w), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Milinda Siriwardana, Dasun Shanaka, Angelo Mathews, Shehan Jayasuriya, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dushmantha Chameera, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga(c), Niroshan Dickwella, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Jeffrey VandersayBangladesh (From): Mohammad Mithun, Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mahmudullah, Nurul Hasan(w), Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Taskin Ahmed, Al-Amin Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Abu Hider, Imrul KayesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
