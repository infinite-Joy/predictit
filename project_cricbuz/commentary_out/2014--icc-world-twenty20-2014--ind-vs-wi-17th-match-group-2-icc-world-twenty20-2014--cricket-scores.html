Alright, we have a final decision and the players disperse! 130 is the official target for India. Ready to go!Looks like Badree will open the bowling for West Indies. Oh wait, there is some conflict as to how much India will have to chase it down. The Indian openers and the umpires are in the middle of a stern conversation. Right then, the equation reads 131 from 20 overs. Sammy also joins the discussion. We are in a frustrating holding period. The confusion stems from the 18th over no-ball off Jadeja. This is what happened on 17.6, "Jadeja slows this up around off, Simmons who has been struggling to middle the strokes, goes for the lofted shot and picks out the long on fielder, Raina takes the catch but Jadeja had overstepped. The umpires took their time to check but once the third umpire confirmed it Simmons was called back." It's taking a long time and the umpires haven't come to a decision. This has been a long delay...We are back. Can Narine and Badree make this total look like a par one? Or will it be a straightforward run-chase, as Mishra reckoned?Mishra: "Yeah, I am full of confidence. I bowled well with the ball. I am putting in a lot of effort. Thanks to MSD, he gives me the freedom to bowl whatever I want. We can easily chase this target down"The spin trio of Ashwin, Mishra and Jadeja shared 6 wickets betweem them. They strangled the run flow and did not allow the batsmen to read them as they kept mixing things up. Dhoni too was brilliant in rotating his bowlers and made the right moves at the right time. The target looks harmless to this Indian batting order but funnier things have happened in cricket. Join us back for the run chase in a short while....India as was expected bowled a lot of spin against the West Indian batsmen. They have done exceedingly well to restrict them to 129. Smith and Gayle never got going as the pacers moved the ball around. Gayle was given two lives but he could not cash in. None of the other batsmen were able to rotate the strike. Simmons who struggled at the start of his innings hit some meaty blows to propel the score past 120 which looked out of reach at one stage.Some conflict as to how much India will have to chase it down.1

The wicket has been better. We need to play good cricket against West Indies."Pitch Report: "It is the same pitch that was used in the first game. It is very hard and flat. There are no foot marks on the wicket. Only because of the dew the captains may want to bowl first. The spinners will be the key on this track. We can expect a high scoring game", says Ravi ShastriTeams:India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed ShamiWest Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy(c), Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Samuel Badree, Krishmar SantokieSammy: "We feel very ready as a team having prepared very well.

Ravi, Fletcher, Cotterell miss out and one more name I forgot."Dhoni: "We tend to relax as there is no reason why we should be tensed as of now, but once the game starts, things will be different. We are looking to bowl first. There is a bit of dew around, but it's not alarming though. We are playing with the same squad"India have won the toss and have opted to fieldLooks like the toss will be delayed as the first game has not been completed yet.Well, we've had a sensational start to this Sunday with the first game between Pakistan and Australia going all the way down to the wire. A cracking contest awaits us, hello and a warm welcome to the second game of today's double-header. It's the defending champions West Indies locking horns against 2007 winners India, who kicked off their 2014 campaign with a win against Pakistan a couple of days ago. Darren Sammy's men have had a nice build-up to this mega event having beaten England at home and then winning both their warm-up games. Dhoni mentioned at the post-match presentation on Friday that the decision on the 3rd spinner would be taken only after having a look at the outfield just before the toss. So it'll be interesting to see the team combinations of both the sides. Toss and more coming up your way in a short while...PreviewThere have been some words exchanged in the build-up to the game between Suresh Raina and Darren Sammy. It adds an extra edge to what was already promising to be an exciting clash.India:They have got off to a good start in the tournament. A morale-boosting win against Pakistan has helped India kick off on a positive not and they will be looking to take the momentum forward. The bowling was much maligned going into the tournament but the managed to put on an excellent show in the first match. Playing three spinners proved to be the clincher in that game but MS Dhoni will be picking the eleven based on the conditions on the day.Yuvraj Singh and Shikhar Dhawan were completely at sea in the first game. though the latter managed a few runs, it will be a cause of worry for the management. Key for success:Bowling at the deathPreparedness to defend targetsWest Indies:The reigning T20 WC champions continue to possess a lot of fire-power that has helped them start as one of the favorites. They will be eager to kick off their campaign on a positive note.Kieran Pollard's unavailability might be a huge blow but West Indies will be keen to prove that they were not overtly dependent on him. Chris Gayle, arguably the best T20 batsman in the world, will undoubtedly be their talisman in batting but the likes of Dwayne Smith, Dwayne Bravo and Sammy make up a pretty strong line-upSunil Narine and Samuel Badree are the two top-ranked bowlers in T20Is. Those two will have their work cut out against the fleet-footed Indians. Dwayne Bravo's T20-League exposure with Chennai will help him against key players like Raina and Dhoni as well.Key to success:Performance of the spinners against India's batsmenChris Gayle's formStats:There are no Indians in the top 30 leading wicket-takers in T20Is while three West Indians feature.Darren Sammy can be an under-rated bowler at times. He is West Indies' leading wicket-taker in T20Is, ahead of the likes of Narine and Bravo.Chris Gayle is 85 short of becoming the leading run-scorer in T20 gamesQuotes:They have a lot of players who can hit sixes but they don't have an idea of how to rotate the strike against spinners - Suresh Raina is pretty dismissive of West Indies' batting abilityRaina has a right to say whatever he wants but if he feels we're (just) six-hitters, then they got to stop up from hitting sixes - Darren Sammy responds to Raina's jibeTeams:India (From): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Ajinkya Rahane, Mohit Sharma, Varun Aaron, Stuart BinnyWest Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Dwayne Bravo, Sheldon Cottrell, Chris Gayle, Denesh Ramdin(w), Andre Russell, Krishmar Santokie, Dwayne Smith, Samuel Badree, Johnson Charles, Andre Fletcher, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Marlon Samuels, Lendl SimmonsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
