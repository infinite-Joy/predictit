WEST INDIES:16.1 Steyn to Sammy, no run, short of a length and well outside off, Sammy gets across and defends it towards backward pointDrinks are on the field nowEarlier, after Gayle was dismissed, Samuels survived a loud shout for LBW off Kyle Abbott's bowling, but surprisingly, South Africa didn't go for the review. The Hawk-Eye suggested that the ball was hitting the middle stump. However, Samuels didn't last long as he was dismissed by Abbott. Abbott also took the wicket of Gayle. Abbott's ability to bowl good lengths and hit the bat hard helped him to pick up wickets. On the other hand, West Indies' batsmen paid the price for hanging back in the crease. Interestingly, South Africa's seamers have looked to mix it up by bowling cross-seam to get the ball to skid off the surface under lights.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 16 overs: West Indies started their reply on a disastrous note by losing the wickets of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels. Jonathan Carter and Dwayne Smith, then were dismissed on the back of fine catches taken by AB de Villiers and David Miller. To make it worse for them, Lendl Simmons' wicket was taken by Imran Tahir as West Indies found themselves in dire straits. On replays it was clear that Simmons had edged it and shouldn't have been given out LBW, but he didn't take the review.

Taking the sport to yet another level - the ultimate in hitting. AB de Villiers 162* off 66 balls v WI, and 64 off two Holder oversHere are a few tweets praising the wondrous batting of AB de VilliersAnd if one casts their mind back to the opening 10-15 overs, West Indies bowled with great discipline. A score of 280 looked tough at that stage. But that's the genius of AB with help from the others. Also credit to SA for sticking to their gameplan of batting solidly till the 35th over and then unleashing.Have a look at these mind-boggling numbers that South Africa racked up - last 20 overs - 261. Last 15 - 222. Last 10 - 150. Last 5 - 96. Holder's first spell read - 5-2-9-1. Then 3-0-31-0. Last two overs - 34 and 30 respectively. Final figures - 10-2-104-1. Worst figures in WC history for a 10-over spell and by a captain. Phew! Just insane stuff!de Villiers: "I am also a bit surprised. Very enjoyable knock today, I thought the foundation the boys laid up front once again allowed us to free up. I don't know, it's just one of those knocks that I think the ball obviously bounced my way. Little bit of luck here and there and I made it count. Not a huge fan of setting targets. We had our basic plans in place. A score around 300 halfway through the innings looked like an achievable total and we were probably pushing for that, maybe 320. And you get some of those days where you click in the last 10 overs. I thought Rilee (Rossouw) played an exceptional knock, great injection of momentum therefore for us and I could bat around him in the start and then could free up at the end as well. It's a bit of everything, bit of a pain in the previous game, this game is only halfway and the only thing on my mind is to win this game. So, a lot of things play a role and we are just ready to defend this total now."AB de Villiers, the man of the moment, spoke to Russel Arnold and we have transcribed the interview word by word.On a slightly controversial note, Ian Gould, one of the umpires, seemed to have a problem with the condition of one of the balls used for the match. He had discussions with both Holder and Taylor.The West Indies camp would be disappointed as they bowled well upfront. Holder perhaps missed a trick by not having a first slip for Benn. Benn was getting a nice drift and troubled Amla and du Plessis. He also made a mistake by introducing Darren Sammy into the attack when de Villiers took strike. Barring an excellent catch taken by Jerome Taylor at long-on to dismiss David Miller, West Indies's fielding wasn't up to the mark. It is a good wicket for batting and at the SCG, the dew factor may come into play, but it has to be remembered that so far only Ireland have been successful in a chasing down a target in this World Cup in Australia. Initially, de Villiers played with a full face of the bat against the seamers. In 40th over of the innings, de Villiers then gave a glimpse of his immense ability by clobbering the wily spinner Sulieman Benn for two fours and a six. He essayed a majestic shot over extra cover for a six and followed it up by going right back in the crease to play the cut shot and collect four runs. He also used the sweep shot to good effect. The century stand between Rossouw and de Villiers came in a mere 60 deliveries. It was Andre Russell, who eventually took the wicket of Rossouw, but by then, the damage was already done. de Villiers though, continued to smash the Windies bowlers to shreds. He even used the scoop to thump Russell for a couple of sumptuous shots and clobbered Holder for 34 runs in the 48th over of the innings. de Villiers composed his century in 52 deliveries and took just 12 more deliveries to get to his 150. His century turned out to be the second fastest in the history of the World Cup. He now holds the record for the fastest 150 in ODIs. South Africa also amassed their highest total in World Cups.The experienced duo of Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis, then looked to steady South Africa's innings. Both the batsmen had their fair share of luck, but they set a solid foundation with a century stand. It was Chris Gayle, who struck twice in a single over to send du Plessis and Amla back to the pavilion. But just in the nick of time, de Villiers and Rossouw ripped apart the opposition ranks with their sizzling knocks. It was Rossouw, who upped the tempo by smashing a flurry of boundaries square of the wicket on either side. He reached his fifty in style by playing a forceful cut shot off Taylor over backward point for a six. de Villiers took over from him to dismantle the Windies attack with a wide array of shots.After South Africa's top-order batsmen struggled against a disciplined effort by the West Indies' seamers upfront, the sparkling explosion of fireworks from the willow of AB de Villiers and Rilee Rossouw helped them to recover and post a mammoth total on the board. In fact, West Indies started on a good note, with Jason Holder and Jerome Taylor bowling with purpose. Both of them produced movement off the deck and Holder also extracted awkward bounce from the surface. Interestingly, they looked to cramp South Africa's opener Quinton de Kock for room and the plan worked, with Holder snaffling the wicket of de Kock.4

Taylor from long-on runs to his right, puts his right hand out and plucks the ball out of thin air. He managed to keep his feet away from the rope as well.

He is currently having a chat with the umpire about the ball. West Indies have had some issues with the ball today.Time for the second drinks break.On a slightly controversial note, Ian Gould, one of the umpires for the match, didn't seem to be particularly happy with the condition of one of the balls and had a chat with the West Indies' captain, Holder. It has to be said that this is a rather abrasive surface and the ball will get scuffed up a bit. It was Chris Gayle, who made the crucial breakthrough by snaring the wicket of du Plessis. Denesh Ramdin, the wicket-keeper, also deserves the credit for showing excellent reflexes to take the catch. To make it even better for the Windies, Gayle dismissed Amla, with the batsman finding himself plumb in front to be dismissed LBW. He is certainly a man with a golden arm. From South Africa's perspective, they need AB de Villiers to essay a captain's knock.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 18 overs: Sulieman Benn, the slow left-arm orthodox, followed up the fine efforts of West Indies' seamers by bowling tidily. He even induced the edge off Hashim Amla's bat, but Jason Holder perhaps missed a trick by not having a fielder stationed at first slip for Benn. As the Windies generally bowled with good control, for a brief period, Amla and Faf du Plessis struggled to free their arms and collect runs. However, Amla and du Plessis are world-class batsmen, and they were able to get through the difficult period and amass fifties. Du Plessis yet again showed his ability to use the depth of the crease and bisect the gaps in the field.

You lose one game and you are in the spotlight. So, won one, lost one, we need to win a couple to find our way into the quarters and then anything could happen. From those quarters, you are three games away from winning the trophy. So, I guess we just need to find some form with the bat, ball and in the field again. I do open the bowling. You are always kind of up against the opening batters. And he (Gayle) made 200 or something, a great knock. These days guys seem to knock off 200 quite easily. Somebody like him, I mean it's expected of somebody like him. He is a great batter, I think leading up to that knock, he hadn't made many runs. So, it's great to see him back in form. And I am up for the challenge. You always want to play against guys who are in form and he is certainly some guy who is in little bit of form.The World Cup, this could be my last World Cup, I might not make the next one in four years time, I might be too old. So, I am going to kind of remember every moment and treasure it, if we can go all the way and win this one. It's crazy, close to 90,000 people I reckon, 89,000 of them were Indians. It's still a great place to play (talking about the previous game against India at the MCG). You are standing at the top of your mark and you can't even get to the captain's attention, who is only 5 metres away from you at mid-off. Great place to play cricket again, MCG. Also got great memories of that place. Just amazing atmosphere of that place again. Whether you win or lose, those are the moments I will remember for the rest of my life.Steyn: Lovely place to come and play cricket. Boys enjoyed playing cricket here, fond memories even if we lose. Couple of years ago we won a series in Australia, exactly where Graeme walked out with a broken hand. So, great place to come and play cricket. I do remember it, I don't remember watching the game (referring to the 1992 World Cup semi-final against England). My cricket only started a couple of years later, but I remember kind of watching, that was kind of the first thing I remember about cricket, the 1992 World Cup. Jonty's run out of Inzamam, the 22 or 21 runs off 1 ball. I actually got Andrew Hudson's shirt the other day, felt the material and how things have changed. It's pretty amazing, this place holds so much history and again a great place to have a World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Loving it. I am really enjoying it. So, it's a great place to tour. We were here recently, we were in New Zealand before the World Cup. Australia is always a great place to visit. Sydney is a great city and kind of reminds me of Cape Town, with the ocean and everything. Dale Steyn spoke to Mark Nicholas before the start of play today. We have his interview transcribed word to word. Here it is:Drinks are on the field now.Holder has certainly added a yard of pace and with his ability to extract bounce from a length, it makes him a bowler to watch out for. If he can get his front leg to snap down hard and point towards the wicket while delivering the ball, he may become a force to reckon with. At present, it seems to collapse at the point of the delivery and as a result, he isn't able to transfer the (kinetic) energy from his legs to the upper body and then to the ball. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 16 overs: The West Indies' seamers, Jason Holder and Jerome Taylor bowled with good disciplines upfront. Both of them produced seam movement off the deck and Holder also extracted disconcerting bounce from the surface. Interestingly, they looked to cramp the left-handed Quinton de Kock for room by bowling from around the wicket. After surviving a few nervous moments, the strategy worked as de Kock was dismissed by Holder. Hashim Amla too struggled with the delivery that nipped back off the seam.

They break up the huddle now and are taking the field.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Lendl Simmons, Jonathan Carter, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Sulieman BennSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Kyle Abbott, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to batAB de Villiers: "It is a beautiful cricket field. Lots of tradition and history. Just love to play some cricket here. Very excited about today. They have got a lot of good players in the team. I think we are pretty clear about what we need to do today to all the players. Just try and follow those game plans. And do the basics well today and hopefully come out on top. We will have a bat first. We know we have to keep our feet on the ground. And work hard today to get a good foundation to allow the middle-order to free up at the end. Hopefully get some good runs behind us and put West Indies under pressure. We just want to play some good cricket and win games. That's all we do. You can't control the toss. Luckily I won it today and we are having a bat first. You can't control certain things - toss is one of them. Bat or bowl first, we need to do both to win the World Cup. And we are hoping to play good cricket whether we bat or bowl first. We had some nice discussions. We didn't hit a lot of balls in the last few days to be honest. Just tried to get away from what happened there. Definitely not our best performance. A little bit embarrassing the way we played there (talking about the loss against India). It is still a long tournament and lots of time to fix things. It is not always a fluent road that you are looking forward to in a World Cup. You just wanna win games of cricket. We will try and up that today."Jason Holder: "No, actually this is my first official game here. I had two warm-up games prior to that. We are coming here full of confidence. Last two games batting has been firing for us. Keep on improving and just have a good game today. It is a good wicket. I am not too disheartened to be bowling first. We get some early wickets and put them under pressure. We should be in for a really good game. We just have one change - Sulieman Benn is in for Nikita Miller. It is just a straight swap. We are just about getting the guys together. It is good for West Indies cricket. Put some wins on the board and just bring back some pride to West Indies cricket. That's most important."Pitch Report: "It is a dry wicket. There is a decent grass covering. The surface is a litte bit two-paced. It is a good wicket for batting. The average score here is 250 batting first. However, a team can get around 300 here," Shaun Pollock.Weather update: There were a few showers earlier but the rain has passed. It is bright and sunny now. It is expected to stay clear throughout the day.Head-to-head: South Africa lead West Indies 3-2 in World Cups.Pool position: West Indies occupy the second spot in the points table with 4 points (won 2 out of 3), while South Africa are fourth with 2 points (won 1 out of 2). West Indies (+1.339) also have a better run-rate in comparison to South Africa (-0.680).Team news: West Indies' star batsman Chris Gayle is doubtful for this game as he is nursing a sore back. Sulieman Benn, who missed the last game due to injury, might make it back into the team. For South Africa,  Farhaan Behardien and Kyle Abbott might replace Wayne Parnell and the injured Vernon Philander. JP Duminy also seems unlikely for this game.West IndiesIn the recent bilateral series against South Africa, West Indies were completely steamrolled. However, on this big stage, they have managed to lift their game considerably. Their last match against Zimbabwe was a record fest. Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels annihilated Zimbabwe with a record 372-run stand. Gayle, in fact, became the fourth player in ODI history to score a double ton. Although Zimbabwe put up a spirited performance while chasing, the duo of Jerome Taylor and Jason Holder made sure the Caribbean team cruised to a 73-run victory.Skipper Jason Holder knows that South Africa can bounce back. He also believes in his team's ability to put up a good show against them. "You can't underestimate them. You have to pay special attention to them. I think once we just stick to our plans. We have plans for them, and if we execute our plans, I think we'll be better off at the end of the day," he added.South AfricaA hard fought win against Zimbabwe in their first game meant that South Africa had to put up an improved show against India in their second match. History was on their side, having defeated the Asian team three out of three times in their previous World Cup outings. However, India proved to be a much harder opposition to beat. Chasing a big total of 308, the batsmen faltered, finally being bowled out for a mere 177. Barring Faf du Plessis, none of the batsmen could live up to their potential. Their fielding was below par and although they bowled well towards the end, their bowlers lacked inspiration.Ahead of the encounter, Hashim Amla insisted that South Africa had put the humiliating 130-run defeat against India behind them. "We didn't play good cricket, but we take the knock on the chin. We know we have a few more games in the round-robin phase, and guys have been playing well. So we don't want to dwell too much on it. But going into the next game we certainly know we've got to perform better," he said.West Indies, who started off their World Cup campaign on a poor note, have spiced up things in Pool B with back-to-back comprehensive wins. On the other hand, South Africa's performances in the tournament so far have been below par considering their standards. Both the teams will be facing each other today at the iconic SCG, in what is expected to be a high-profile encounter. Let us first have a look at how they have fared in their recent games.PreviewSouth African captain AB de Villiers fought hard to make himself as unobtrusive as possible to the West Indies skipper Jason Holder on Thursday, not making eye contact and pretending not to be listening to his opposite number during the media interaction on Thursday ahead of the ICC Cricket World Cup Group B match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.But on Friday, de Villiers will have to take charge and breathe life into the Proteas' campaign that has been off only to a sluggish start. In defeating Zimbabwe and losing to India, they have not resembled the side that came into the tournament looking the best prepared to take on favourites Australia. But they exude a quiet confidence that they will peak at the right time."We are not sure of the place in the quarterfinals. We would not like to be that team that stumbles before we get there. The most important thing is to make sure we have a spot there first and then play some high-pressure, make-or-break kind of cricket," de Villiers said, indicating that an element of doubt had crept into the team's thinking."They (West Indies) are a dangerous team. I believe if you put enough pressure on them like any other team really, they can crumble. Also, you've got to look at the other side. We haven't played well in the last game. So we have to make sure that we look after our side and our games and make sure we do the basics well. We must make sure we play a good game of cricket," he said.The West Indies, on the contrary, have gained some momentum by regrouping after the shock defeat by Ireland. They have beaten Pakistan in Christchurch and Zimbabwe in Canberra quite comprehensively, What's more, the redoubtable Chris Gayle also hammered the first double century in World Cup history, making the West Indies' opponents stress a bit.The West Indies face a couple of question marks over the fitness of players like Gayle and left-arm spinner Suleiman Benn, both of whom are playing with back problems. Holder said Gayle has been struggling over the past with his back. "We're trying to monitor him as best as we possibly can," he said. "We'll see how Benn pulls up on Friday and make a decision."Holder also said the team was aware that South African team could compete as a unit, though it has players who stand out. "You can't underestimate them. You have to pay special attention to them. I think once we just stick to our plans. We have plans for them, and if we execute our plans, I think we'll be better off at the end of the day," he said.Holder, all of six foot seven inches but still establishing himself as leader of the West Indies team, allowed himself a wry smile when asked if he felt strange that de Villiers was in the media conference room when he was speaking to the media. The Proteas captain, grinning was more forthcoming."It's quite interesting. I actually felt a bit uncomfortable. I didn't want to put him off, you know. It will feel a little bit intimidating for me to sit here in the background. So I was trying to pretend like I'm not listening and not to make eye contact just to make him feel a bit more comfortable," de Villiers said.On Friday, de Villiers and his team will have to turn up, refreshed after an off day and rediscover their mojo if the spectators at the historic SCG and those watching on TV or internet are to be treated to a competitive contest.
