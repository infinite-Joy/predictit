Adam Milne is back as well - that sets up a mouthwatering pace clash with Dushmantha Chameera.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Ross Taylor, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Doug Bracewell, Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghanSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Danushka Gunathilaka, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dushmantha Chameera, Ajantha Mendis, Suranga LakmalSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batThe visitors themselves have their fair share of injury problems. Lasith Malinga has pulled out of the ODI and T20I series with an injury while the likes of Dhammika Prasad and Kusal Perera will be sorely missed. Angelo Mathews' men have been consistent in this format of the game and they will look to start on a winning note. Toss and team updates in a while..It's Boxing Day and the cricketing festivities resume all across the southern hemisphere. Hello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the first ODI between New Zealand and Sri Lanka. We are at Christchurch, on the South Island - of this beautiful nation. After having been humbled in the two Tests, the visitors will be keen to get back to winning ways, in a format that they are perhaps a notch better. They are up against a depleted hosts. New Zealand will be missing Kane Williamson, the world number one Test batsman. Also missing in their ranks are Grant Elliott, the hero of their successful World Cup campaign in 2015, Grant Elliott and Corey Anderson. To further compound issues, Trent Boult and Tim Southee have been rested.Preview:Having sealed a convincing series win in the Test series, hosts New Zealand will look to assert their dominance in the ODIs in the opener of the five-match series in Christchurch. New Zealand have won 22 off the 35 games they have hosted against Sri Lanka, and the home side will be confident of maintaining their good form. When the two sides faced off in the seven-match ODI series ahead of the World Cup, New Zealand romped home to a 4-2 series win. While the New Zealand team wears a very similar look to the one that played earlier this year, Sri Lanka have undergone many changes with Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene's retirements. New Zealand:The News about Brendon McCullum retiring soon would have hit the New Zealanders hard, and they will want to ensure that they give their captain as many wins as possible before he ends his career against Australia. Henry Nicholls, according to batting coach, Craig McMillan, is ready for his debut, but it would be surprising if they select the left-hander for the opener.Sri Lanka: The Sri Lankan side is still a young side with many players playing in NZ for the first time, and the likes of Angelo Mathews and Tillkaratne Dilshan will have to lead by example if the side are to trouble the World Cup runners-up. Lasith Malinga's injury will come as a major blow for the visitors, and they will hope the young Dushmantha Chameera steps up in the absence of his senior partner. Thisara Perera's inclusion adds much needed steel to the line-up in both the batting and bowling departments.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Danushka Gunathilaka, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Milinda Siriwardana, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Dushmantha Chameera, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Kithuruwan Vithanage, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Pradeep, Jeffrey VandersayNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, George Worker, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Doug Bracewell, Ish Sodhi, Adam Milne, Mitchell McClenaghan, Henry Nicholls, Matt Henry, Tim SoutheeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
