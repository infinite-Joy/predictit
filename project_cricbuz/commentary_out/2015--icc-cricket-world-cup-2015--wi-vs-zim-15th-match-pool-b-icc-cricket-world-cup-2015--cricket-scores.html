ZIMBABWE:20.1 Samuels to Brendan Taylor, out Caught by Ramdin!! That's another perplexing call from the third umpire, Taylor walks away disappointed. Another decision that has gone against Zimbabwe. Can we call it as a howler from third umpire, Ranmore Martinesz? This was tossed up and just outside off, Taylor went for the sweep, the ball ballooned off the forearm? But did it brush the gloves as well? The third umpire certainly thought so, Gould has to change his decision. Brendan Taylor c Ramdin b Samuels 37(48) [4s-2 6s-1]Samuels to Brendan Taylor, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Shout for a caught behind. West Indies want a review. Ramdin was very confident, so was the bowler. Brendan Taylor is suggesting to his partner that it went off his forearm and replays prove him right. But did it flick the gloves on the way, nothing on the Snicko. The original call from Ian Gould is NOT-OUT, but he has changed his decision. OUT is the call

Curtly Ambrose has some encouraging words for the West Indies players. They break up after a brief huddle and are now taking the field.@rameshsrivats: 200s in ODIs -Indian, Indian, Indian, Indian, West Indian.@cricketaakash: If this game was in B'lore Gayle would've become the first batsman to score an ODI triple ton...club class bowling.@rgcricket: Chris Gayle is the first player to score a....300 in Tests200 in One-Day Internationals100 in Twenty20 Internationals@fwildecricket: Chris Gayle is an IPL Boss, has two Test triple centuries & an ODI double. Love him or hate him he's a legend of the game.@cricket_U: RECORD ALERT: This is highest ever team total in all the ODIs played in Australia, beating 368-5 by AUS vs SL at Sydney in 2006.Here's some tweets on Gayle's stupendous innings: We have Chris Gayle's interview transcribed word-by-word. Here it is. Gayle: "I'm getting a bit of cramps now, I'm tired, still have to field 50 overs so hopefully we can restrict them. Overall in the innings, struggled at the start, scary the first ball as well, come on - you can't be serious, I can't be out on the first ball. No, I need a chance and I get a break and I made the best use of it. I just said thank god and that's all I did when I put my head on the sky. You know, it's been a lot of pressure and the runs haven't been coming. This is the first time in my career, so many people wanted me to score runs and the messages keep coming in, on twitter on your cellphone and everything - this is the first time I have ever seen, so many people wanting Chris Gayle to perform so badly and in the end I'm really glad, I gave them something actually to cheer about. It was slow at the start to be honest and it was keeping a bit low as well. You got to take the bull by its horns and try and play some shots and try and put some pressure back on them. And I didn't want to actually dig myself into a shell as well and just try and be aggressive out there and then eventually the field spread, took ones and twos, and when you want to pick it up as well then you can choose which bowler to target and get your runs. That's how I actually played this innings and I'm really happy in the end, but out on the last ball (smiles). Sometimes a lot of people see you on the field and they don't know what you are going through. Still struggling with the injuries and these sort of things. Got to push myself to try and get the preparation right. I have been restricted in that area as well. It's been different and I'm not getting any younger as well, age catching up on you as well and I have to cut down on the party as well. These sort of things I have to put in place and eventually get a performance out there, but overall I'm really happy and like I said, let's try and build on this as much as possible. The team can gain some momentum going into South Africa, which is another important game, but let's finish it off and move ahead. Since the rule came in, to be honest with you - 4 players out I maybe score one half-century since that rule actually came out. Like I said it was a bit easy for batters to score more runs, but in the end like I said, if I get past a hundred, I definitely gonna make it a big one and I'm happy to get my first double-century in ODI cricket. A lot of fans have tweeted about this since Rohit Sharma scored two double-hundreds, you know, Sehwag and those guys, everybody expected me to do it as well. I'm glad I get a chance to do it and I did today. I'm satisfied."The Zimbabwe players looked dejected as they walked off the field. That is understandable considering the colossal total on the board. Also, the West Indian bowlers are in fabulous form, having mercilessly destroyed Pakistan in their previous game. All Zimbabwe can do is take it one ball at a time and concentrate on building partnerships. The match was under the threat of rain for the last one hour or so. But the slight drizzle was not heavy enough to take the players off the field. Let's hope the rain stays away for the second innings. Join us back for the chase in a few minutes...The highlight of the innings was no doubt, the burly Chris Gayle, who became the only non-Indian batsman to get a double hundred in ODIs. This, by the way, is the fastest double ton in ODIs and also the highest individual score in World Cups. The intimidating Jamaican smashed 10 fours and 16 huge sixes thoroughly destroying Zimbabwe's bowling attack. West Indies scored 152 runs in the last 10 overs to finish on this monstrous total. For Zimbabwe, except Sikandar Raza, all bowlers went for over 6 an over. The duo of Gayle and Samuels completely spoiled the figures of the remaining bowlers, who had enjoyed a decent run until the powerplay.The West Indian batsmen struggled initially to get bat on ball but eventually managed to steady the ship. Zimbabwe, who were able to keep them quiet in the middle overs, failed to sustain the momentum for long. Gayle brought up his fifty, subsequently also crossing 9000 ODI runs. He became only the second West Indian, after Brian Lara to achieve this landmark. Samuels, who looked streaky initially, got going once he went past his fifty as well. West Indies accelerated in the third over of the batting powerplay and never looked back since then. They scored 55 runs in the powerplay and kept hammering the bowlers ruthlessly from there on.West Indies finish on a mammoth 372 on the board, the fifth highest team total in World Cups. In fact, they have posted above 300 in all of their three games so far. The credit for this total goes to Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, who put up the highest partnership in ODI history for any wicket. At the start of the innings Zimbabwe were terrific, with Panyangara snaring the wicket of Dwayne Smith on the second ball of the innings. Chris Gayle then survived a close lbw review later in the same over.Gayle walks off the field amidst cheers from the crowd. He waves his bat towards the crowd, who applaud for the belligerent display they have been witness to today. You put him under too much pressure and this is how he responds. He was under fire from all quarters for his poor form coming into this game. His response was the fastest double ton in ODIs. It was just special to witness the knock. Even though there was a drizzle and strong breeze at the Manuka Oval, it was the Gayleforce that blew everyone away. Bow down to the champion from West Indies.4
WEST INDIES:49.6 H Masakadza to Gayle, out Caught by Chigumbura!! Finally an outstanding innings comes to an end.

Panyangara will open the attackPanyangara will start off with the new ball. Two slips to assist....West Indian openers Dwayne Smith and Chris Gayle are now making their way to the middle. Gayle is just 79 runs away from 9000 runs in ODIs. He is yet to fire in the tournament. Will he cross the landmark today?The Zimbabwe players are in a huddle. The skipper Elton Chigumbura is having a chat with the boys. Alright, they break up and are now taking their positions on the field.The teams are making there way out for the national anthems. The good thing is that the sun is out. It is suddenly very bright and sunny right now.Zimbabwe have faced West Indies five times in the World Cup but have not won any of the games. Can they rewrite history today?Teams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Sikandar Raza, Regis Chakabva, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w), Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Elton Chigumbura(c), Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai Chatara, Tafadzwa KamungoziWest Indies (Playing XI): Dwayne Smith, Chris Gayle, Jonathan Carter, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Lendl Simmons, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Nikita MillerWest Indies have won the toss and have opted to batElton Chigumbura: "Yeah, he has brought a lot to the team, especially the team is fantastic at the moment (when asked about coach Dav Whatmore's contribution to the team). Hopefully we can carry on that form that we are in. We wanted to bat first but anyway we just have to play good cricket. Hopefully we can restrict them to a lower score and we can chase it down. Obviously, a good start is important to us. Hopefully we can take early wickets and put them under pressure. Not really, just have to control things that we can control (when asked about the inclement weather). Hopefully we can play good cricket. Solomon Mire is out and Stuart Matsikenyeri is in."Jason Holder: "That's one thing we stress in our team meetings. It is all about being consistent. After the last game, just need to be consistent and keep moving forward. We will bat first. It seems to be a pretty good wicket. We played here before and seemed to have done well when we have batted. So hopefully we can put some runs on the board. The top four batters have started to set it up but have not carried on. We are just stressing on them to carry on. And we have the firepower in the middle and the end to finish. We hope today is the day they actually fire. I have full confidence in them (when asked about the opening partnership). We have got two forced changes. Darren Bravo is out with a torn hamstring. Carter replaces him. Sulieman Benn misses out today with a sore back and Nikita Miller gets his opportunity."Pitch Report: "The pitch looks very good. It is nice and dry. There is a bit of grass rolled in. Traditionally, it is a batting surface but intelligent bowling will do well here. The team winning the toss might want to bat first. But it does not really make a difference. It will stay consistent throughout," reckon Pommie Mbangwa and Allan Border.For now, let us hope the rain stays away. We are just minutes away from the toss and team updates. Don't go anywhere...Weather report: It rained all night and the conditions are still overcast in Canberra. Rain is expected to pay a visit later and it is quite humid as well.The West Indian camp is also not too worried about their batting line-up. Andre Russell believes in the team's ability to post big scores. "Chris has been struggling and we are still scoring 300," Russell said after their victory against Pakistan. "I guess when his contribution comes, we'll get somewhere close to 400 hopefully," he added.Chris Gayle's poor form was the talking point before this match. However, Zimbabwe are not taking him lightly. Hamilton Masakadza said in the pre-match conference that they do not consider Gayle as a diminished force. "He hasn't really played that well, like you said, in the recent past, but that doesn't make him any less of a player. I still think he's a very good player, and I still think he's their biggest threat," said Masakadza.Team news: West Indies suffered another blow as one of their star batsmen, Darren Bravo, sustained a hamstring injury in the match aganst Pakistan. In his absence, Jonathan Carter is expected to come into the side. Ideally, Zimbabwe would like to play the same team. However, Chamu Chibhabha, who made a solid 64 against South Africa in their first fixture, might come back into the side in place of Sikandar Raza.Zimbabwe: They impressed everyone in the warm-up fixtures with strong performances against New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Continuing from where they left off, they did well in the first game against South Africa, reducing them to 83-4 at one stage. Although they could not sustain the momentum and allowed the opposition to post a mammoth total, their confident start with the bat earned them high praise. Against UAE in their second game, they were even better, both with the bat and ball, securing a comfortable 4-wicket victory.West Indies: Their first match was a forgettable affair with Ireland winning the game by 4 wickets. Despite putting up an excellent batting show and amassing 304 runs on the board, the bowlers failed miserably, allowing the Irish side to win with more than 4 overs to spare. They bounced back remarkably well in their next match against Pakistan, romping to a massive 150-run victory. This time the bowlers upped their reputation to annihilate the Pakistani top-order with their lethal bowling. They reduced the Asian team to 1 for 4, with Jerome Taylor picking up the first three wickets.Let us have a look at how these teams have fared so far.13:00 Local Time, 02:00 GMT, 07:30 IST: Normally a match between West Indies and Zimbabwe would be considered as a one-sided affair. However, the level of performances in this tournament so far has been so high that any definite assumptions cannot be made. West Indies and Zimbabwe will face off today in the 15th game of the competition at the picturesque Manuka Oval. Both teams are entering this fixture on the back of a win and a loss each.PreviewWest Indies and Zimbabwe have demonstrated an ability to bounce back after a poor start in the tournament. West Indies started off their 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup campaign with a four-wicket loss to Ireland at Nelson, but bounced back in spectacular style by defeating Pakistan by 150 runs, their best win against the team from sub-continent in ODIs in terms of runs. On the other hand, Zimbabwe let South Africa off the hook at Hamilton and they were punished by David Miller and JP Duminy, who put on a world record fifth wicket stand of 256. They shook off the defeat and chased down 286 against a spirited UAE side in Nelson. Heading into 15th match of the tournament on Tuesday at the Manuka Oval in Canberra, both teams look even on paper due to their inconsistency but the pressure will be more on Zimbabwe as they aim to put up a better show against big teams.Venue: Manuka Oval, CanberraDate: 24 February, 2015Time: 09:00 AM ISTWeather: Maximum of 25 degrees with 80 percent chances of rainTeam newsWest IndiesDarren Sammy's passionate call to rally round skipper Jason Holder has touched a nerve with the team. During the Pakistan game, West Indies displayed intensity in all departments and they will be hoping that the consistency is maintained as the tournament progresses. Lendl Simmons has been the vital cog in the lower-middle order, scoring a century and a fifty in the first two matches, while the likes of Darren Sammy and Andre Russell have finished off the innings in aggressive style.The top order continues to be a worry for the team and heading into the match, there has been a bit of controversy for the West Indies regarding Chris Gayle. WICB president Dave Cameron apparently retweeted a twitter post from a fan which read, "Gayle goes.... Can't buy a run. Let's give him a retirement package." The tweet has since been deleted but it highlighted a growing frustration regarding Gayle's form, having averaged just 14.42 in the last 20 matches. But, Holder brushed aside the issue and said the team has full confidence in Gayle. "Chris will put this incident behind him and move into this game," Holder said in a media interaction at Canberra.The team will be without Darren Bravo due to a hamstring injury he sustained in the Pakistan game. Bravo is also in doubt for the clash against South Africa in Sydney and Jonathan Carter, who scored just 80 runs in the five-ODI series against South Africa before the tournament, is all set to make his World Cup debut in Canberra.ZimbabweConsistency against the big teams is a major issue for the African team. Against South Africa, they had dominated the first part of the match but failed to sustain the momentum. Bowling is a major worry for Zimbabwe, having conceded 339 and 285 in their first two matches. Tinashe Panyangara has leaked 73 and 66 runs in his ten and nine overs respectively and the rest of the bowlers have not been threatening. The batting has also lacked consistency. Barring Hamilton Masakadza, Craig Ervine and Sean Williams, the rest of the batting needs to contribute.Heading into the match, Masakadza pointed out that despite the poor form, Gayle remains a major threat. "If he fires, he can really take a game away from you," Masakadza stated. Zimbabwe might make a change for the game in Canberra. Chamu Chibhabha, who did well against South Africa but was dropped unexpectedly for the UAE match in Nelson, might replace Sikandar Raza in the team.Players to watch outWith scores of 102 and 50 so far, Lendl Simmons is in fine form. He has gotten the team out of a tough situation in both the matches and his batting has been a mixture of maturity, caution and aggression. With Darren Bravo out injured, Simmons could move to the top of the order and give stability.Sean Williams has been a good utility player for Zimbabwe. In both the matches, his left-arm orthodox has been the most economical while with the bat, his unbeaten 76 was pivotal in the chase of 285 against the UAE in Nelson. Williams had a good outing against the West Indies in the 2007 World Cup when he scored 70 and he will be expected to deliver the goods yet again.Probable XI:West Indies: 1 Chris Gayle, 2 Dwayne Smith, 3 Jonathan Carter, 4 Marlon Samuels, 5 Lendl Simmons, 6 Denesh Ramdin (wk), 7 Darren Sammy, 8 Andre Russell, 9 Jason Holder (c), 10 Suleiman Benn, 11 Jerome TaylorZimbabwe: 1 Sikandar Raza/Chamu Chibhabha, 2 Regis Chakabva, 3 Hamilton Masakadza, 4 Brendan Taylor (wk), 5 Sean Williams, 6 Craig Ervine, 7 Elton Chigumbura, 8 Solomon Mire, 9 Tinashe Panyangara, 10 Tendai Chatara, 11 Tafadzwa KamungoziQuotes"I could feel it out there. I tried not to show it. Try to breathe, relax, try to hit the ball down the ground, that's the way we've been training, and it ended up paying off." Sean Williams after his match-winning knock against the UAE."I can bat if there's 20 overs still left to go, but I think I really enjoy when there's five overs or 10 overs left. I can come out and just play my natural game. It's not like I have to be cagey." Andre Russell talked about his approach to battingStats- West Indies and Zimbabwe have played each other five times in World Cups and Zimbabwe have lost all five matches.- In World Cup matches between these two teams, only one batsman has scored a century.
