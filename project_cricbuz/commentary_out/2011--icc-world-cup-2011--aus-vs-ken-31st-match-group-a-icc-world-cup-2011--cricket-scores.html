KENYA:42.4  Tait to Odoyo, byes, 1 run, run, BOWLED but ladies and gentlemen, a batsman can't get out on a free-hit, the ball ricochets towards point and they take a bye, that's ridiculous to be honest, the bowler had done extremely well to send a crushing yorker to peg the middle stump back, and it results in a bye, that's the price bowler's pay for erring!

KENYA:40.3  Lee to Collins Obuya, 1 run, slower one outside the off stump, Collins Obuya gets an outside edge as he looks to steer it square, will only get a singleThe required run rate is mounting, it is over 14 rpo now.

KENYA:38.1  Lee to Collins Obuya, leg byes, FOUR!!, good bouncer, but unlucky for Lee, thwacks Collins Obuya on the shoulder and goes wide of a diving Haddin to the fine leg boundary, it would certainly not please the bowler, he gave it his all, but the result - 4 runs!
KENYA:37.6  Watson to Collins Obuya, 1 run, had Ponting hit the stumps, that would have been the end of Odoyo, or was it?

Collins Obuya taps it wide of Clarke at backward point and sets off for a non-existent single, Mishra responds, but can't make it, the direct hit has found him well short of the crease.

KENYA:33.6  Watson to Mishra, 1 run, a mighty appeal that from Watson, the umpire has called NO, it was pretty close, height might have been the only issue, the ball nipped back in sharply and rapped Mishra on the knee roll in front of middle and leg, they should have gone for the review, 15 seconds up, and Ponting walks up to Watson and asks him to walk towards his fielding position,he has a smile on his face

It was David Obuya's call, Collins Obuya just shooed him away. Hussey picked it up and threw it to Haddin.

KENYA:3.6  Tait to Obanda, out Bowled!! What a poor shot. A brain melt from Obanda and he has thrown it away. Now Tait enjoys that wicket with a huge sarcastic smile - which suggests - I knew that was coming. An awkward hoick across the line to a full toss and the middle stump was flattened. Obanda missed it completely and that ends his little cameo, which included a couple of biggies against Tait. Obanda b Tait 14(10) [6s-2] Tait to Obanda, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Ouma c Haddin b Lee 4(13) Lee to Ouma, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Ouma is on strike. Lee will open the attack'I get the feeling Ravi Shastri' has this to say about Kenya's chances of chasing this huge target: They have a mountain and a half to climb. With that wonderful piece of insight from him, we are all set to resume the chase. Ponting has his mouth full with gum and is seen saying a few words in the team huddle. Then he breaks away from the huddle and hares across to his fielding position. 2 slips for Lee as he steams in.Australia have posted a massive score as expected and will be very happy with it. All the batsmen got to spend some time in the middle and Clarke was the lynchpin of the innings. He played a fluent knock and seems to be in terrific nick. Michael Hussey has started his WC campaign confidently and that will be a boost to the Aussies. Kenya did well in patches but the attack was not consistent enough to trouble the Aussies for long periods. It will be the exact opposite when the Aussies come out to bowl and it is a very tough ask for the Kenyans. Join us shortly for the run chase.4

AUSTRALIA:49.5  Otieno to Johnson, FOUR!!, that's good batting!

AUSTRALIA:49.4  Otieno to Steven Smith, 1 run, full toss, middle and leg line, chipped down to long on after walking a couple of paces forward, can't take two
AUSTRALIA:49.3  Otieno to Johnson, leg byes, 1 run, we have seen many leg byes today, this one was angled in from round the wicket, it nipped back in as well, struck Johnson on the pad in front of leg stump, the ball goes to the left of the diving keeper
AUSTRALIA:49.2  Otieno to Steven Smith, leg byes, 1 run, that was more of a leg cutter, pitched outside leg and goes across, traps Steven Smith outside the off stump as he shuffles across, the ball rolls towards point
AUSTRALIA:49.1  Otieno to Johnson, 1 run, poor bowling that, short, Johnson had to wait for it and then pull it through mid wicket, just a single

AUSTRALIA:48.5  Odhiambo to Johnson, 1 run, delicately tapped to the off side for an easy single
AUSTRALIA:48.4  Odhiambo to Johnson, FOUR!!, that's Johnson for you!

AUSTRALIA:48.1  Odhiambo to Clarke, out Caught by Patel!! Odhiambo denies Clarke a hundred, he perishes after equalling his highest WC score. Clarke wanted to go over long on, swung through the line, got the middle of the bat but didn't quite get the required power into the shot, good catch by Patel, the ball was dying down on him and he did well to judge it to perfection. Clarke c Patel b Odhiambo 93(80) [4s-7 6s-1] Odhiambo to Clarke, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:47.6  Otieno to Steven Smith, 2 runs, pitched up, Steven Smith drives it to long on, takes a couple, courtesy the misfield by the fielder
AUSTRALIA:47.5  Otieno to Clarke, 1 run, the bowlers are drifting on the pads more often than not, Clarke, who is batting on 93, takes it all too easy, works it behind square on the on side, comfortable single that
AUSTRALIA:47.4  Otieno to Steven Smith, leg byes, 1 run, Steven Smith tries to pull again, goes off the pad square on the on side
AUSTRALIA:47.3  Otieno to Steven Smith, FOUR!!, one of those fours that would not please the batsman and would frustrate the bowler even more, Steven Smith was making room looking to swing it across, gets a bottom edge and the ball rolls wide of the keeper to the fine leg boundary
AUSTRALIA:47.2  Otieno to Clarke, leg byes, 1 run, back of a length and a lot slower, goes off Clarke's thigh guard to short fine leg

AUSTRALIA:46.6  Odhiambo to Clarke, no run, slower one from Odhiambo, Clarke can't pick that up, misses the pull
AUSTRALIA:46.5  Odhiambo to Clarke, 2 runs, good fielding by Kamande, Clarke stuck that hard towards extra cover, Kamande dives to his right to get some hand to it, certainly saved a couple of runs for his team, the bowler appreciates his efforts
AUSTRALIA:46.4  Odhiambo to Clarke, 2 runs, Clarke makes room by clearing his back leg, drives it on the up towards long on, quick running again
AUSTRALIA:46.3  Odhiambo to Clarke, no run, too full and sliding down the leg, looks like Clarke got some bat to it, or else it would have certainly been a wide, they wanted to sneak in a single, but the keeper was quick enough to collect the ball
AUSTRALIA:46.2  Odhiambo to Steven Smith, 1 run, Steven Smith creates a bit of room and slaps it to deep extra cover
AUSTRALIA:46.1  Odhiambo to Steven Smith, no run, he's by far been the best bowler for Kenya, slightly short of a good length and angled in, Steven Smith misses the full blooded pull, or a mightly swing of the bat you can call, ball goes over the off stump and thuds into the gloves of the keeperNehemiah Odhiambo [8.0-1-41-2] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:45.6  Otieno to Steven Smith, 1 run, on the leg stump, Steven Smith gets an inside edge onto the pad and the ball rolls towards short fine leg
AUSTRALIA:45.5  Otieno to Clarke, 1 run, on the pads again, Clarke goes across and whips it to deep square leg

Two slips for Thomas Odoyo as he comes in to bowl. Watto to face first up. I put my head on the line and say that Kenya will run Australia close. Ok we will see as the game goes on. We are all set to go.The players are out. The Australian anthem follows the Kenyan one. Bright and sunny conditions at Bengaluru, not even a cloud in the sky. The Aussies have got what they wanted, they are batting first. Expect heaps of runs to be scored on this wicket. Srivathsa, has finally made it to the office and he will take you through until the first drinks break.Teams:Kenya (Playing XI): Maurice Ouma(w), Alex Obanda, Collins Obuya, David Obuya, Tanmay Mishra, Thomas Odoyo, Rakep Patel, Jimmy Kamande(c), Nehemiah Odhiambo, Elijah Otieno, James NgocheAustralia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, Michael Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Jason Krejza, Shaun TaitCaptains' comments:Kamande: The wicket is good, it is not a bad toss to lose. This might be our last chance of playing against Australia, everybody is looking forward. We are ready, the only thing we are looking for is to improve our top order batting.Ponting: We would want to bat first, we have just had one full game in the last 16 days. Training has been spot on, the boys are keen to get going. We have got 3 games in the next 6-7 games and it would be good to go out there and perform. Mike Hussey is in, that's good for us. David hasn't done anything to be left out, but it is unfortunate that he is not playing. We have to make sure that we do everything well with the bat.Australia have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: There is a tinge of green on the wicket. The new ball will move around, there will be some good carry and reasonable bounce on the wicket. There will be a bit of dryness too. Kenya will be tempted to bowl if they win the toss, but the Aussies would want to bat first and get some match practice feels Tom Moody.It's Bengaluru again, Australia take on Kenya in what promises to be quite an easy task for the men from Down Under. Australia would hope to win the toss and bat first so that their batsmen get some good match practice. This is Ajith, I will take you through the day along with Pradeep, Ganesh and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be right back with more updates..Preview - by Karthik LakshmananIt's been around 12 years and 32 matches since Australia lost a game in a World Cup and that record is unlikely to change as the World Champions take on minnows Kenya in Bangalore. While most of the associate nations have shown glimpses of competitiveness at various stages of the World Cup, 2 teams been easy push overs. One is Canada, and the other is a team which even lost to Canada - Kenya. Australia, who had 2 tough pre tournament practice games against India and South Africa, will be looking forward to an easy warm up game against Kenya.AustraliaAustralia will be eagerly awaiting the game for many reasons; they last played a complete game way back on February 25 and more importantly, they would want to test Mike Hussey's form and fitness ahead of the knockouts. Australia haven't had much of a test in the tournament so far. They had easy wins against ZImbabwe and New Zealand, and rain ruined a potentially interesting contest against Sri Lanka in their next game. Australia are unlikely to face any test until their last league game as they face Kenya and Canada in their next two encounters and would be hoping to have easy rides against the associates.
The return of Mike Hussey to the team gives Australia a balanced outlook. With an in form top order and a middle order boosted by Hussey's return, Australia possess one of the most dangerous batting line ups in the tournament. Their pace dominated bowling attack looks threatening with the likes of Lee, Johnson and Tait in good form. What remains to be seen is the effectiveness of their spinners Krejza and Steven Smith and Australia would be looking to test them before the high pressure knockouts begin.
Ricky Ponting has openly expressed his opinions against the inclusion of associate nations in World Cups. Australia would be looking forward to justifying their captain in the next 2 games.KenyaKenya are doing everything they can to justify the ICC's decision to restrict the number of teams in future World Cups. Nothing is going right for the African team. They started their campaign by getting whacked by the Kiwis in Chennai, losing the game in around 3 hours. They were then caught in Afridi's spin before being yorked out by Malinga in the next 2 games. They even bungled the only realistic opportunity of winning a game as they went down to Canada in their next game. To make things worse, there were reports of off field controversies with differences between the coach and senior players. Kenya would be encouraged by some decent knocks by the Obuya brothers with the bat. They would be desperately hoping for a miracle from one of them to put up a decent performance against a team like Australia.Head to HeadAustralia and Kenya have met 4 times before this and as expected, Australia have won on all occassions.Quotes:I am still a believer that the World Cup should be a place only for the best eight or ten teams: Ricky Ponting
