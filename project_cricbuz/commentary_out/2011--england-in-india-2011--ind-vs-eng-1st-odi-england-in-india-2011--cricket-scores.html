ENGLAND:9.1  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, out Pietersen Run Out!! Pietersen might be quick, he might have played it off the front-foot, but he played it too sweetly and didn't beat the throw from Ash. He admonishes himself and walks off. Never a single there, it went very quickly to the man. Having said that, if he had dived, he would've survived. India won't mind it though. England in trouble now. Pietersen run out (Ashwin) 19(29) [4s-3] Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!KP looks to be in trouble. He is gone I guess. A direct hit from mid on. KP won't get the BOD here. He didn't dive and that might well have cost him his wicket. Superb fielding from Ash. Picked it up and threw down the stumps at the non-strikers end. OUT! Pietersen's troubled stay ends.
ENGLAND:8.6  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, 1 run, retains the strike with that run with a well timed clip down to square leg. Again shuffling across and getting it down
ENGLAND:8.5  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, no run, good length delivery outside off, Pietersen taps it softly in front of coverKP pulls out as Praveen Kumar runs in to bowl and he isn't happy. Throws the ball in disgust. MS walks up to Pietersen and has a word. It is all sorted. Ready to go again.
ENGLAND:8.4  Praveen Kumar to Alastair Cook, 1 run, cut to RJ at point and he isn't quick enough to cut off the singleSourav Ganguly  is getting really predictable on air. Uses the words 'there you see' for the millionth time today. Here is what he had to say: 'There you see a mom and a daughter who have come watch the young guys play'. This is getting very irritating now.
ENGLAND:8.3  Praveen Kumar to Alastair Cook, no run, not there for the cut and Alastair Cook is lucky that he doesn't bottom edge that onto his stumps. The ball rolls to Mahendra Singh Dhoni
ENGLAND:8.2  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, 1 run, wristed to mid on softly and they pinch a single again
ENGLAND:8.1  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, no run, Pietersen steps out and punches a length delivery on the up to mid off

ENGLAND:7.4  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, Pietersen gets forward and times the punch well, but Kohli at mid off is straighter and he cuts it off
ENGLAND:7.3  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, Vinay Kumar tried to do a Pollard there and nearly ended up hurting himself. It was pushed to his left. No chance he would have got there, but he tried an ambitious leap in the air and was miles away from the ball. Ended up looking comical on television.
ENGLAND:7.2  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, once again the shooter outside off beats Pietersen on the forward push. He is struggling to play Vinay Kumar who is mixing it up and well
ENGLAND:7.1  Vinay Kumar to Alastair Cook, 1 run, brilliant fielding from Tiwary at backward point. Dived to his right and saved some runs. Fab cut shot from Alastair Cook, but Tiwary helped Vinay Kumar out therePietersen is really struggling. Reminiscent of the innings he played against India in the World Cup game at Bangalore. He is trying a bit too hard to time the ball and the slow pitch isn't helping him. He needs to be there for a long time if England have to make a fist of this
ENGLAND:6.6  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, FOUR!!, that last ball has spoilt what was a very good over until then. Short and wide outside off, Pietersen just leant forward and fore-handed a drive on the up past point. The ball screamed away to the fence. Praveen Kumar keeps staring at Pietersen who turns his back and walks away.
ENGLAND:6.5  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, no run, another slower leg-roller, Pietersen punches it back to Praveen Kumar, who leaps and deflects it with his right hand. 5 dots in a row and the pressure is building on Pietersen.
ENGLAND:6.4  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, no run, Pietersen shuffles across to off stump and takes a few steps out too, but the slower leg cutter stops on him and he turns it to short mid
ENGLAND:6.3  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, no run, now Praveen Kumar threatens to throw down the stumps, but doesn't after Pietersen drove one back at him. The crowd like it too.
ENGLAND:6.2  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, no run, stump to stump line and Pietersen defends from the crease
ENGLAND:6.1  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, no run, good length delivery outside off, pushed to cover without any timing
ENGLAND:5.6  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, 1 run, a direct hit and Pietersen might have been walking off. Pushed to mid off and Pietersen hares off to make it. Survives as the fielder misses. That was a close call for Pietersen.
ENGLAND:5.5  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, that has hurt Pietersen. He immediately takes the glove off and winces in pain. The strategy of walking down the wicket hasn't helped Pietersen who sparred at that one which bounced from a steepling length. It was an awkward delivery and caught Pietersen on the glove. After a look at the finger, he puts his gloves back on and is ready to go again. Good sharp and smart bowling from Vinay Kumar. 2nd time today he has troubled Pietersen with the short delivery
ENGLAND:5.4  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, that one stayed low again. Pietersen did well to bend down and push that ball which was well outside off without any timing to the off side

ENGLAND:4.6  Praveen Kumar to Alastair Cook, 3 runs, they make it a great over by running beautifully. A length ball on the pads has been clipped past mid wicket and both the batsmen
ENGLAND:4.5  Praveen Kumar to Alastair Cook, FOUR!!, bad ball again. You can't bowl short and wide to Alastair Cook. He and Strauss are the two best players of the cut shot in the England team and Alastair Cook latches on to that offering and whiplashes a fierce square cut past a diving backward point. Third man retrieves the ball from the ropes
ENGLAND:4.4  Praveen Kumar to Alastair Cook, no run, that's a much better length, drawing Alastair Cook forward and the intended on drive produces a thick inside edge that rolls to mid on
ENGLAND:4.3  Praveen Kumar to Alastair Cook, FOUR!!, Shot! That was an exceptional shot. Alastair Cook just whipping a short of length delivery on off stump past a diving mid wicket. Almost VVS like. Magnificent roll of the wrists and the ball raced away as it went past the fielder
ENGLAND:4.2  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, 1 run, there is a bit of friendly banter between Praveen Kumar and Pietersen after Pietersen takes a single to deep square leg with a well timed clip. Both have a chat and a smile about it. Remember that Pietersen was Praveen Kumar's captain when they played together for RCB.
ENGLAND:4.1  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, FOUR!!, this is poor captaincy from Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Praveen Kumar is bowling so well and he doesn't have a slip. If there was a slip that thick edge would've been gobbled up. Pietersen fishing loosely at a wide delivery and getting a healthy edge. Praveen Kumar isn't impressed, but you have to question the captaincy of MS there.
ENGLAND:3.6  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, 1 run, shuffles across to off and wrists it wide of mid on to retain strike
ENGLAND:3.5  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, FOUR!!, That's a dangerous shot. But Pietersen is such a risk-taker, that he gets it away past short fine - who is inside the ring - with a deft tickle from middle stump line. Just turned the wrists at the right moment and placed it past the man. Vinay Kumar has his hands on his head and rightly so, for had Pietersen missed it, he was a dead duck.
ENGLAND:3.4  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, Jeez! That didn't bounce at all. Pietersen is miles outside the crease and had to crouch low to get some bat on it. Wouldn't have mattered even if he had missed or get hit on the pads as it was well outside off. Goes on the bounce to MS. The crowd find their voice again.
ENGLAND:3.3  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, and again, Pietersen is taking a few steps out, defends the length delivery back to Vinay Kumar
ENGLAND:3.2  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, good thinking from Vinay Kumar. Surprised Pietersen who was walking down the wicket with a short delivery, Pietersen thought about the pull, then realised he wasn't in any position and allowed it to hit his body. The ball dribbles away to the off side. Ash and the crowd like it.
ENGLAND:3.1  Vinay Kumar to Pietersen, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, Pietersen is batting well outside the crease, solidly defendedKP pulls out at the last moment as someone in the crowd moved as Vinay ran in to bowl. He isn't happy with something behind the sight-screen. Tarapore gets into the act and does some waving. It's sorted and we are ready to go again.

ENGLAND:2.3  Praveen Kumar to Pietersen, no run, Pietersen 'as is his wont', steps out and moves across to off, before turning it to short midKevin Pietersen, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:2.2 Praveen Kumar to Kieswetter, out Caught by Dhoni!! Boy are the Indians pumped up or what? What a send-off that to Kieswetter. Bad shot in the first place. Poked at a ball well outside off and edged it to the right of MS who took a neat catch. But the real action started after that as Praveen Kumar pumped his fists vigorously and screamed in delight, simultaneously looking at Kieswetter. Then as he was mobbed by his team-mates, Kohli - ever the aggressive man - uttered a few choice words in Hindi and sent him on his way. Kieswetter shakes his head and walks off. Lovely line and length, but Kieswetter played a nothing shot really. India get the early wicket that they so dearly wanted. Kieswetter c Dhoni b Praveen Kumar 7(8) [4s-1] Praveen Kumar to Kieswetter, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ENGLAND:2.1  Praveen Kumar to Kieswetter, no run, short of length and seaming back in, Kieswetter punches it to cover, straight to the fielder

ENGLAND:1.2  Vinay Kumar to Kieswetter, FOUR!!, first runs for England and Kieswetter. Very full and on middle stump, Kieswetter just wristed that whippy on drive past RJ at mid on, who dived to his left, but the timing on that beat him easily. Lovely looking shot to get off the mark
ENGLAND:1.1  Vinay Kumar to Kieswetter, no run, full ball on off stump, Kieswetter gets forward and plays the defensive shot with an angled bat. He likes going over off after trying to make room. Very dangerous ploy that if the ball seams or swings.Vinay Kumar, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
ENGLAND:0.6  Praveen Kumar to Alastair Cook, no run, excellent start for Praveen Kumar and for India. Beats Alastair Cook with a short and wide delivery that bounced a tad extra.

ENGLAND:0.5  Praveen Kumar to Alastair Cook, no run, good bowling and the crowd cheer after the 5th consecutive dot. Praveen Kumar draws Alastair Cook forward and Alastair Cook pushes it softly down to the cover regionThe slip is out and a short extra cover is in place.

England need to bat well if they are to have any chance of chasing this down. Will the dew play a part? We will know shortly. Here we go. A lone slip for Praveen Kumar.150 runs have come in the last 15 overs. It has been a superlative effort from Raina and Dhoni. The Batting PP changed the entire equation for India as they scored 59 runs in the PP. Dhoni carried on with his good work as he carted the England bowlers everywhere. India have finished up on 300 and they will be hoping that the bowlers come to the party. Join us in half an hour for the run-chase.4

Parthiv was backing up too far and didn't have enough time to react. That shot probably deserved a boundary, but this is a cruel game (especially if you are an Indian playing against England).

Hopefully it should be resolved by the time the match starts.India play 3 seamers, and the lone spinner will be Ravichandran Ashwin. What a big opportunity for him! This will be a big test for the youngster, as this is the first time he will lead the spin attack. Will he deliver?Teams:India (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane, Gautam Gambhir, Parthiv Patel, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Vinay Kumar, Umesh YadavEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Ravi Bopara, Jonathan Bairstow, Samit Patel, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Steven Finn, Jade DernbachIndia have won the toss and elected to batWe'll start with some bad news for England: Ian Bell is not playing today.  We'll tell you why, as soon as we get to know.Hello and welcome to the coverage of India's search for a win against England - part 2. To describe India's recent tour of England as a humiliation would be an understatement, and Indian fans would want nothing less than a revenge. India have a young squad, but needless to say, the home conditions would suit them. England on the other hand will be on a high after their victorious start in the tour games. Stay tuned for more updates..Preview by Ganesh CThe five match ODI series has already been touted as a revenge series for India after the humiliation they suffered in England earlier this year. They are yearning for a win and history suggests it is not an ideal place to start of for them. India are yet to taste victory at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium, Hyderabad in an ODI.The fall from the heights of the World Cup win has been swift and painful for India. England added insult to injury after the whitewash in the Test series by annihilating India in the ODIs too. That Indian ODI team bore a very different look compared to the one that won the World Cup but it bears a lot of similarity to the team that will be taking on a confident England side in this series.India:One of the key factors that helped India win the World Cup at home was their impressive batting unit. Every member of that side was a proven match winner with the bat. The loss of Sehwag, Tendulkar and Yuvraj has been a huge one but the return of Gautam Gambhir at the top offers them some respite. It is, as always, an opportunity for the youngsters to climb up in the pecking order. The likes of Ajinkya Rahane and Parthiv Patel have impressive domestic records and will be eager to prove themselves on familiar territory. These problems pale in comparison to the one they face in the bowling department. Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh, their two most experienced bowlers are not playing and the attack does loose a lot of teeth due to the absence of the former. Praveen Kumar and R Ashwin, who have grown in stature in recent months, will have to take up the additional responsibility of leading a young attack. Umesh Yadav and Varun Aaron come in with a reputation of being quick and it remains to be seen how effective they would be on the flat tracks when they get a chance.England:Alistair Cook got off to a dream start as a captain in his first ODI series but this one will test him a lot more. England have done well not to sit back and rest on past success. They have shown a lot of intent in coming in early to adapt to the conditions. The key to their campaign will be the way their batters play in the slow and low tracks. The squad has a few members who have not played a single game in India and that is a challenge they will be looking forward to. Cook also faces a problem of plenty in the middle order and one among the three of, Ravi Bopara, Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen might be forced to sit out. The bowling is a balanced one with Graeme Swann leading the pack. The seamers might lack in experience in sub-continent conditions but are coming in with a lot of success which they will be taking forward.Quotes:What's gone is gone and we are totally off it. This is a new series and everyone knows how strong India are at home - Alastair Cook.We have had a few youngsters who did well in England. Also the wickets were very different out there. For us what matters most is good performance in all three departments - Mahendra Singh DhoniTeams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jonathan Bairstow, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Scott Borthwick, Tim Bresnan, Jos Buttler, Jade Dernbach, Steven Finn, Alex Hales, Craig Kieswetter(w), Stuart Meaker, Samit Patel, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Jonathan Trott, Chris WoakesIndia (From): Virat Kohli, Rahul Sharma, MS Dhoni(w/c), Varun Aaron, Sreenath Aravind, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Gautam Gambhir, Praveen Kumar, Ajinkya Rahane, Parthiv Patel, Suresh Raina, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay Kumar, Umesh YadavLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
