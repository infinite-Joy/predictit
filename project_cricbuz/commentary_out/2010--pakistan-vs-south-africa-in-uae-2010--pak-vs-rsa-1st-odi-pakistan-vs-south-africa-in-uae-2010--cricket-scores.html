Akhtar v Amla and Gul v Smith, interesting contests to look forward to. This is Ajith and I will take you through to the first 10 overs.Pakistan have lost their last 8 wickets for 46 runs.

Tsotsobe ripped through the heart of the Pakistan batting, going on to pick up his career best figures of 4/27. Can Pakistan make SA work hard for the runs or will it be a breeze for Smith and company? Join us at 8:40 PM IST to find out.4

PAKISTAN:0.2  Langeveldt to Shafiq, no run, good comeback this, full and outside the off stump, Shafiq comes on the frontfoot and hangs his bat at it, slight away movement beats the batsman on it's way to the keeper
PAKISTAN:0.1  Langeveldt to Shafiq, FOUR!!, not the kind of a start Langeveldt would have wanted, length ball on the pads, Shafiq goes back and tucks it to backward square leg, the outfield is quick and the ball will beat the fine leg fielderAlright, here we go!Shafiq and Hafeez are at the crease. Shafiq is on strike. Langeveldt will open the attackPitch report: The wicket will be good to bat on. The groundsmen are using a spray to prevent the dew which may help the conditions stay the same throughout. There is not much grass as compared to T20s. Batting will be a lot easier and it's always good to bat first and put runs on the board. Spinners will play their part later on feels Pommie Mbangwa.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Johan Botha, Charl LangeveldtPakistan (Playing XI): Asad Shafiq, Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Fawad Alam, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Zulqarnain Haider(w), Umar Gul, Shoaib Akhtar, Saeed AjmalSmith: We would have batted as well. There was not much time to enjoy the two wins. Langeveldt and Kallis are back in place of Albie and Theron.Afridi: The track looks good, we have 3 changes. Shafiq, Younis Khan and Fawad Alam are in. I would want to set an example as a captain and perform well. We need to first bat the full quota of 50 overs. Umar Akmal, Hasan and Farhat miss out.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to batAfter a dismal batting performance in the T20Is, Pakistan will be itching to perform well in the 5 match ODI series starting today. South Africa on the other hand will be looking to continue their winning run this season, and with their bowlers joining the party, Smith will indeed be a happy captain. This is Ajith and I will bring you all the action with my colleague Shashank. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates..by Vishaal LoganathanPakistan's sorry story seems to be never-ending. After a disappointing Asia Cup, the series against Australia and the embarrassing tour to England, they would've looked at the series against South Africa as the ideal opportunity to put their recent slump behind them and get back to winning ways. But, the two T20s they played against the Proteas turned out to be the same old story, they ended in consecutive defeats for the Pakistanis.For the South Africans, their build up to the World Cup cound not have started off in better fashion. They swept the T20 and ODI series against the Zimbabweans with little fuss and have now beaten Pakistan comprehensively in the two T20 in Abu Dhabi. They will, no doubt, be looking to continue in their rich vein of form and string together similar performances to help them seal the 5 match ODI series.Pakistan Pakistan cricket seems to be in dire straits and their camp will hugely benefit from good performances by their team. Their batting caved in far too easily against the South African bowling line up and their captain will be praying for no such repeats. Pakistan were dismissed for paltry scores on consecutive occasions in the T20, and their bowling had no chance to defend the meagre totals, even if they managed to put up a fight.Misbah-ul-Haq was the only player to come out of the T20 series with some kind of pride having waged a lone battle to give his bowlers something to bowl at. Pakistan's batting has at times bordered on being catastrophic, and vast changes are required if they are to try and win the ODI series. Their batsman, barring Misbah, just did not seem not seem to be in their elements and they got out playing some outrageous shots. The return of Younis Khan will add a lot of steel to the Pakistan batting line up. His experience and skill will help a lot, and Pakistan will be hoping he does not display any kind of rustiness and gets into groove as quickly as he can.Pakistan's fielding and bowling too hasn't been much to write home about. Agreed that they had not put up a competitive total on the board and had to counter the dew on the ground, but a better performance in the field would've ensured that the Proteas did not amble to victory twice in two games.South Africa South Africa are without doubt on the top of their game with successive series victories against the Zimbabweans and the Pakistanis. They have also found themselves quality youngsters in Juan Theron and Colin Ingram and the Proteas will be keen to test them against the Pakistanis. Theron, who was called in to the squad thanks to his impressive form in the T20s, and Ingram impressed in the series against Zimbabwe and duly carried their good form into the T20 in Abu Dhabi. Another series of good performances will all but seal their place in the WC squad.The squad will also see the return of Graeme Smith as captain, and the return of Jacques Kallis and Dale Steyn will boost the side from Africa.Hashim Amla has been in stellar form this year and the South Africans will rest on him to get them off to another good start. The right hander had a superb ODI series against Zimbabwe, which was studded with two sparkling centuries. AB De Villiers and Ingram too were on top of their batting in that series and they will look to keep going in that fashion.The bowling department will receive a big boost with the return of Dale Steyn and Kallis. With Steyn being supported by the likes of the Morkels, Kallis and Johan Botha, they can be relied upon to skittle out Pakistan for a less than competitive score.Pakistan aren't new to controversy and bad form; they have often been written off after a bad series and this is when they are at their most dangerous. They have the ability to beat any team in the world and the Proteas will have to be wary of that.The South African squad will go into the game as favourites, but Graeme Smith will know that accounts for nothing and will drive his squad to not take Pakistan lightly.Teams:Pakistan (From): Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Zulqarnain Haider(w), Asad Shafiq, Fawad Alam, Imran Farhat, Misbah-ul-Haq, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Shahzaib Hasan, Shoaib Akhtar, Tanvir Ahmed, Umar Akmal, Umar Gul, Wahab Riaz, Younis KhanSouth Africa (From): Graeme Smith(c), Johan Botha, Loots Bosman, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, Jacques Kallis, David Miller, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Juan Theron, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Hashim Amla, Charl LangeveldtLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
