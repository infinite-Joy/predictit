The series is well poised at the moment with both teams having shared the first 4 games. Sri Lanka have had a rough tour so far and would like to return home with a series win under their bag.Cook will look to begin his captaincy stint with a series victory against the WC finalists. A lot depends on 22 yard strip though. England will go into the match as favourites if the pitch is anything like Trent Bridge while the same can be said of Sri Lanka if the pitch resembles Headingley. I am Pradeep and I will bring you all the action along with Kiran. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates.Preview by Siddharth VishwanathanEngland have struck back with a vengeance. After two losses at Leeds and Lords, England trounced the Lankan Lions with 10 wicket drubbing at Trent Bridge. This was only the fourth time that they defeated an opposition by 10 wickets in an ODI and it could not have come at a better time for Alastair Cook. After receiving a lot of flak at Lord's, the captain led from the front with the bat and silenced his critics who argued that the one day game would not suit him in style. Sri Lanka were woeful at Trent Bridge and they will be low on confidence as the last match heads to Manchester, where both teams have a chance to win the series.The Sri Lankan batting has depended on the exploits of two or three of their key players in this series. Anytime one of them has fired, the team has had resounding success. However, when the big guns fail to fire, the team falls apart completely. Sri Lanka's weak middle order has been the talking point for most of the summer and at Nottingham, England blew them away without much effort. Dilshan has not looked at his best at the top since his thumb injury. The two stalwarts of Sri Lankan cricket, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, have been the only consistent performers in this series. Sangakkara's 75 in the fourth ODI gave the cricketing world a lesson on how to rebuild, but there has been no support. Dinesh Chandimal was brought back to earth after his high-flying century at Lord's. Thilana Kandamby has not contributed much while Angelo Mathews has contributed fairly towards the end.The other factor that has been troubling the Lankans has been the moving ball. At the Oval, Jimmy Anderson's swing destroyed them and in the fourth ODI, Anderson was once again the wrecker in chief. The Sri Lankan batsmen will have to work hard to counter the swinging ball.Their bowling was wayward at Trent Bridge, with none of the bowlers even threatening to trouble the openers. Suranga Lakmal and Lasith Malinga have been great in patches but they have continued to give away runs freely. In this series, Lakmal has picked up seven wickets but has an economy rate of 6.29. Malinga has picked up six wickets but his economy rate has been 5.43. The inability of the Lankan seamers to build pressure and pick early wickets has been the main reason for their inconsistency.England are also saddled with a weak middle order. It is to their credit that Cook and Craig Kieswetter have been in wonderful form at the top of the order. Jonathan Trott has had a rare lean series with the bat, while Kevin Pietersen and Eoin Morgan have failed to convert their good starts. Cook will be vary of the weak underbelly of the England batting, but he has shown remarkable aptitude in this series. His blazing unbeaten 95 was a treat to watch. Kieswetter has been at his aggressive best and is a welcome addition to this England squad after being left out for some time. Cook will be hoping that the rest of the batsmen come to the fore in the final ODI if England are to clinch the series.James Anderson has twice wrecked the SL top order, but he has proven ineffective when conditions have not aided him. The star of England's bowling line-up has been Graeme Swann, who has picked up seven wickets at an economy rate of 3.5. He has constantly choked the Lankans in the middle overs and not allowed them to get away. With Anderson in good form and with Swann building pressure in the middle overs, England have a far superior bowling attack than the Lankans and the team will be hoping that conditions suit them at Old Trafford.This ODI series has seen a lot of ups and downs for both teams. A series win for Sri Lanka will give them some cheer after a rather gloomy summer. A win for England will help them build momentum ahead of their huge series against India in a couple of weeks.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Eoin Morgan, Ian Bell, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Jade Dernbach, Stuart Broad, Tim Bresnan, Steven Finn, Chris Woakes, Samit Patel, Ravi BoparaSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Thilina Kandamby, Thissara Perera, Angelo Mathews, Suraj Randiv, Jeevan Mendis, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dimuth Karunaratne, Ajantha Mendis, Dhammika PrasadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
