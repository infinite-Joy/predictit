We would have loved to bat first too. We've made three changes to the team. Shafiq, Shoaib Malik and Wahab Riaz will miss out. Abdur Rehman consistently put pressure on the batsmen in the Test series. We need more stability at the top of the order. It is really important and that is why we have Azhar Ali back in the team.Cook: We're going to bat first. It looks similar to the previous track. When you keep winning games you pick the same team. We have to start from scratch and do well. I'm a work in progress in ODIs and I'll have to do well.England have won the toss and elected to batHello and welcome to the 2nd ODI between Pakistan and England. 'The Queen's Men' will be fired up for this one after getting a head start in the series courtesy their overwhelming victory against the hosts. Pakistan on the other hand will be eager to regain some of the form they displayed in the Test series. One can expect a few changes in Pakistan's line up, especially after Shoaib Malik's poor performance in the first ODI. The hosts will want to ensure that they win this one so that they don't have to play catch up and so that they can give themselves a realistic chance of winning this series. England too have a big incentive in this game, if they seal a win here then they cannot lose this 4 match series.Preview by Shashreek RoyIn a span of a week it seems as though two teams have undergone a complete transformation. Although just a single One Day International is not a yardstick to go by, it does look as though David has suddenly decided to play the role of Goliath.Pakistan were completely outplayed by England, a side they conquered not too long ago, in a format that the latter least prefers. The result of that loss means that the visitors will go into the second ODI as favourites, a term that hasn't been associated with England in this tour so far.EnglandAfter a torrid time in the Test series, England have finally found a way back in the tour and for the moment they have silenced their critics. The first ODI did see them undergo another trial by spin and they did falter owing to a five wicket haul by Saeed Ajmal and a brace by Shahid Afridi. Despite all that, it was the way their skipper batted and the way they bowled that really earned them a more than convincing victory. In fact, captain Alastair Cook's knock proved to be more than the difference between the two sides as the Englishman scored 137, seven runs more than Pakistan's eleven batsmen.England now will be looking to build on that momentum and they will be well aware of the fact that they have finally been able to expose some of the weaknesses that Pakistan's batsmen posses. James Anderson failed to pick up any wickets despite bowling some tight lines, however, his compatriot really turned on the heat with a four wicket haul. Steve Finn in many ways was the man responsible for Pakistan's downfall, as he ripped through the top order with some fierce pace and swing. Samit Patel and Graeme Swann together ran through half the side. England's chances of clinching the ODI series will remain high as long as their bowlers perform the way they did in the opener.If there is one thing that needs to be altered in the England line up for the second ODI, it is the middle order batting. Apart from the skipper and Ravi Bopara, none of the English batsmen were able to cross the 20 run mark. A worrying sign for any team in the world, more so for one that is renowned for its depth in batting.The side should remain the same for the second ODI, however, if Jos Buttler does recover from his injury then England might be tempted to bring him in and strengthen that middle order.PakistanA 3-0 whitewash for the first time ever against England, records galore and an opposition that never really fought back hard. Such a scenario can cause most people to get a little overconfident and Pakistan certainly looked guilty of being just that in their first ODI against England. The hosts were skittled out for a very low score and they never really looked to give themselves a chance with the bat.One wouldn't have to call Mr.Sherlock Holmes to practice his art of deduction in order to find out what's suddenly gone wrong with Pakistan. In fact this is a case that even Watson can crack, it is indeed that simple. The batting is a mess, all of it. While some might argue that the batting order is at fault, most would agree that the batsmen that comprise that order aren't fully equipped at the moment to be in that playing eleven.Pakistan's real issue is with their former captain Shoaib Malik. There is no doubt that he has contributed to Pakistan's success in the past but it looks as though the man is well past his prime. In the last two years, Malik has averaged just 9.88 in 12 matches and has a highest score of only 39. There is an argument that Malik must be played higher up the order to be effective, I'm sorry but for a player who averages under ten there is no point in talking about where he plays, he shouldn't be playing at all.The other reason Pakistan have been keen to retain Malik is for his off spinners. What they don't realize though, is that they don't need another spin bowler. They have the likes of Ajmal, Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez to contribute to the spin bowling department. In such a situation the smartest thing to do would be to replace Malik with an in-form batsman, someone like an Azhar Ali perhaps. Besides, Ali has been retained due to his performances in the Test arena and this would be a good opportunity to try him out in the shorter format.All said and done, Pakistan do not need to hit the panic button just yet. They have experience in their batting line up, courtesy Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan, who can steer the ship and their opposition has continued to look fragile against spin. What Pakistan need is to put the Test results behind them and realise that they have to start from scratch if they are to come out on top in the One Day series.Final Word: England will certainly go into this ODI with more positivity and will be considered the slight favourites. Pakistan still have a good chance of levelling the series though, they did dominate the same opposition not long ago and if the hosts can string together the right changes and knock some sense into their batsmen, then they could well and truly come out on top in this clash.
