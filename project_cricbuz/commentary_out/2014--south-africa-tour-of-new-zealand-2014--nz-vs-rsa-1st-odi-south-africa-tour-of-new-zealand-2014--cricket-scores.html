The team is high on confidence as they won the tri-nation series in Zimbabwe which included Australia. Faf du Plessis, in particular was in excellent form as he scored 3 hundreds in the series and won the Player of the Series. How will the sides shape up today? Hello and welcome to the first ODI between New Zealand and South Africa. Toss and teams coming up in a short while...The countdown to the World Cup has begun. Every team will be looking to get their squad right before naming the final 15. The 3-match ODI series will help both New Zealand and South Africa. The Kiwis will be tested against a quality side like the Proteas. The home team is without some of their key players, the ones missing are Ross Taylor(out due to a calf strain) and Kane Williamson. However, they have the experienced Daniel Vettori returning to international cricket after a gap of 16 months.PreviewSouth Africa begin an one-day series against New Zealand looking to strike a psychological blow against the Black-Caps ahead of the Cricket World Cup early next year. The three-match series, which begins in the North Island's picturesque Mount Maunganui, will also give the Proteas a chance to familiarise themselves with local conditions in preparation for the World Cup pool matches they will play at New Zealand venues.South AfricaOn paper, the series should be a mis-match, with South Africa ranked the world's second best ODI team, just behind Australia, while New Zealand languish at seventh. In addition, the Proteas have three batsmen in the ICC's top 10 (AB de Villiers, Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock), and two of the world's best-ranked bowlers (Dale Steyn and Ryan McLaren).Captain de Villiers said the tourists will not underestimate New Zealand, either in the upcoming series or the World Cup, when he believes home advantage means Brendon McCullum's men will rank among the tournament favourites. The World Cup is a glaring omission from South Africa's trophy cabinet and de Villiers said the New Zealand series provides the chance to sharpen his team's skills for the tournament.South Africa have had a successful year so far in the shorter format of the game. They arrived in New Zealand on the back of a victorious campaign in Zimbabwe, where they clinched the triangular series after beating Australia in the final. The winning sequence has allowed the selectors to maintain a level of consistency in selection, a big positive with the World Cup fast approaching.New ZealandNew Zealand, meanwhile, have just one player ranked among the ODI elite in batsman Ross Taylor, and he will miss the series with a calf strain. But the Blacks Caps frequently punch above their weight in the 50-over format, including eliminating the Proteas at the quarter-final stage of the last World Cup in 2011 and claiming a first-ever ODI series win on South African soil last year.New Zealand fast bowler Adam Milne will join Taylor on the sick list for the series, while batsman Kane Williamson will miss the first match and then undergo a fitness test. The Black Caps have called in Dean Brownlie and Tom Latham to bolster their depleted batting stocks. They also welcome veteran spinner Dan Vettori back into the 14-man squad after a long stint on the sidelines injured, although it is not yet clear whether he will play.Numbers1: Brendon McCullum is one innings away from becoming the fourth New Zealand player to have featured in 200 innings or more.320: The number of runs AB de Villiers requires to reach the mark of 7000 in ODI cricket. If he reaches the milestone within 13 innings, he will become the fastest to 7000.379: The number of runs Hashim Amla requires to reach the mark of 5000 in ODI cricket. If he reaches the milestone within 21 innings, he will become the fastest to 5000.Quotes:We have played a good brand of cricket for the last five or six months. We beat India, Sri Lanka away, Australia and Zimbabwe away so we are quite happy with where we are at the moment: South Africa coach, Russell Domingo.We've never played international cricket this early in the season so the conditions will be challenging and it's hard to know how the new ground at Bay Oval will shape up: New Zealand coach, Mike Hesson.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Aaron Phangiso, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Rilee Rossouw, Wayne Parnell, Vernon Philander, Kyle AbbottNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, James Neesham, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Daniel Vettori, Kyle Mills, Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Dean Brownlie, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
