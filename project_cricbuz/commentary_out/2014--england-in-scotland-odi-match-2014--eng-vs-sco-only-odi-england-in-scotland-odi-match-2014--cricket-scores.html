The forecast doesn't look great, but let's keep our fingers crossed for a truncated match.Hello and welcome to the only ODI between England and Scotland. With the World Cup only 9 months' away it's an ideal preparation for these two teams to set the combinations right. It will be the first match for England under the coaching of Peter Moores and he would want to set the records straight. The outfield was soaked by heavy rainfall yesterday and the forecast for today also isn't great, but the local authorities are hoping that things will brighten up towards afternoon. Stay tuned for the toss which will happen in about 15 minutes....Preview:Alastair Cook must take a bold step into unknown territory as his England team try to mark a new era by putting distance between themselves and their winter of discontent. Cook admits his own first foray to Aberdeen and a one-day international assignment against Scotland under his and returning coach Peter Moores' guidance represents a "banana-skin fixture".Weather permitting, anything but a clear-cut victory will give the sceptics early ammunition as judgements begin to be made about a nascent regime with issues to address following England's 5-0 Ashes drubbing and then a hapless defeat to Holland in the final match of their failed ICC World Twenty20 campaign.Moores was involved in neither - having succeeded Andy Flower in the head-coach role and Ashley Giles in charge of England's limited-overs teams - and Cook too was absent for the Dutch debacle in Chittagong.The opening salvo in the summer schedule, at international cricket's most northerly venue on Friday, comes in the intermediate format - and the only one in which England managed a series victory in 2013/14. Cook is aware of the danger from hosts who will lack nothing in motivation, and little in skill either, but is encouraged by what he has seen so far from a familiar squad featuring only one uncapped player.If England have learned a lesson from their hugely disappointing and chastening winter and a messy aftermath which has brought much change, it is a renewed recognition that they must never take the positions they have earned for granted.Meanwhile, Scotland captain Kyle Coetzer wants his side to follow the example of the Netherlands and Ireland by becoming the latest non-Test nation to beat England. Coetzer set out a statement of intent to remind England of their winter woes while acting coach Craig Wright revealed he has already tapped into the relevant knowledge of Paul Collingwood and Peter Borren about how to upset the odds.Borren's Holland famously did just that with a 45-run humbling of England in an T20 WC dead rubber just five-and-a-half weeks ago. Collingwood was in the England camp then, as assistant to limited-overs coach Ashley Giles. Previously, however, it was Collingwood - a triple Ashes-winner with England - who joined forces with Wright to help Scotland qualify for the 2015 World Cup.England have since dispensed with Giles' role, and Collingwood returned to captain Durham for one more summer. That, however, has not prevented him giving the Scotland management some advice for a fixture in which Coetzer senses the visitors may be vulnerable after their 5-0 Ashes drubbing and other troubles in 2013/14.Coetzer, playing in his hometown, is determined to make the most of his opportunity. Holland, twice, and Ireland have beaten England in the past five years. He hopes it is Scotland's turn.Scotland, like England, will also be looking to impress a new coach in front of an expected 2,000 sell-out crowd in Aberdeen, a hotbed of cricket north of the border. New Zealander Grant Bradburn, who takes over as Scotland coach in July, will be in attendance, but just with a watching brief on this occasion.Teams:Scotland (From): Kyle Coetzer(c), Freddie Coleman, Josh Davey, Alasdair Evans, Matthew Cross(w), Majid Haq, Michael A Leask, Matt Machan, Calum MacLeod, Preston Mommsen, Safyaan Sharif, Rob Taylor, Iain WardlawEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Moeen Ali, James Anderson, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Harry Gurney, Chris Jordan, Eoin Morgan, Joe Root, James Tredwell, Chris WoakesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
