Sid V here to take you through for the first half of the innings.Rahim: The groundstaff reckon that there will be dew later on in the day and so we wanted to bowl first. The Test series is starting and we want to play positive cricket. Imrul Kayes and Rubel Hossain are out. Kapali and Reza come in.Misbah: It looks like a good track, but it will get slower. Asad Shafiq and Abdur Rehman come into the team. There is no Sarfraz Ahmed and Imran Farhat. The conditions are not easy for batting as the ball was spinning a lot. The batsman are struggling a bit but they have played sensibly.Pitch Report: There is a slight breeze blowing across the ground. Bangladesh have won seven out of the 12 ODIs here. The pitch looks hard and it is hot. The spinners will have a role to play. The outfield is not lush and the ball will be scruffed up.Stuart Law, Bangladesh Coach: Pakistan are in a rich vein of form and unfortunately, we have not played well. We train with intensity but the opposition has put us under immense pressure. Bangladesh are not a difficult side to coach. They are skilled and are physically able. I have not spent much time to understand them mentally. We are playing for pride. There were a lot of positives taken in the previous match and Nasir Hossain's innings gave us a lot of momentum.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal(w), Shoaib Malik, Shahid Afridi, Abdur Rehman, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul, Saeed AjmalBangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Alok Kapali, Elias Sunny, Mahmudullah, Nasir Hossain, Abdur Razzak, Shafiul Islam, Farhad RezaPakistan have won the toss and elected to batWelcome to the third and final ODI between Bangladesh and Pakistan from Chittagong. Pakistan are aiming for a clean sweep in a series that has been one-sided. They have combined well as a unit and the Bangladeshis have had no answer. Bangladesh, on the other hand, will be glad to return to their 'fortress'. In the last five ODIs played at Chittagong, they have won four matches with one match being abandoned. The toss will take place at 12:30 PM IST.Preview by Siddharth PrabhakaranIt is said that during torrential rains and tornadoes, when even huge trees get uprooted, the small plants don?t even stand a flimsy chance. Pakistan, on a roll with their new found confidence, represents a deluge which has the potential to drown any side in international cricket. They proved that when they steamrolled past Sri Lanka in the UAE. Bangladesh are known as the minnows of world cricket and despite their talent, they were handed out humiliating defeats in the first two ODIs. The Pakistani spinners, especially the Pathan from Khyber Shahid Afridi, made a mockery of their batting in Mirpur in the first ODI and in the second, they could just manage 186 in their 50 overs after being 19/4. The Pakistan batting has been a little scratchy, but is not the one which will surrender to the Bangladesh bowling, however effective it might be. The hosts will look through that flimsy little opening to win the third ODI which will restore much pride and bring joy to their loyal and cricket crazy fansPakistanProbably the strongest and most diverse side in International cricket today, winning this series was never the bone of contention. How badly were the losses for the hosts going to be, would have been the question on the fans mind. They started in spectacular fashion bowling the hosts out in 30.3 overs for less than 100. True to form, their star was Afridi who picked up a 5 wicket haul in less than 7 overs. The other bowlers contributed a wicket each and in the 2nd ODI, it was Hafeez, opening the bowling, who sent down his 10 overs for just 15 runs and picked up 2 wickets. Indeed the bowling has been the reason for their current dominance. Their batting on the other hand, will be tested by a better opposition which possesses more incisive bowlers. They were 63-5 in the chase of 94 in the first ODI before Afridi rescued them. The other batsmen exuded a bit more stability in the next game, but a lot more is desired from names like Younis Khan and Misbah-Ul-Haq. They will look to test their bench strength now that the series has been won. In all probability the tall pacer, Mohammad Khalil, might get a game. The spotlight will surely be on Shoaib Malik who has not scored any big runs since his comeback to the playing 11. BangladeshBangladesh have been on a downward spiral. They put up a good show against West Indies in the T20I, but took a beating in the ODIs and the lone Test. Their team composition has constantly changed and seniors like M Ashraful have never taken the responsibility. The skipper Mushiqur Rahim has performed really well, indeed he has been their sole bright light. His leadership skills have come out to the fore, but overall the team doesn?t have the potential to defeat a side like Pakistan. The batting has looked fragile and even a senior pro like Shakib-Al-Hasan could do nothing against the Pakistan bowling. Shakib and Nasir Hossain managed to negotiate the bowling in the 2nd ODI, but that was just because they were looking to play out the 50 overs and not to win the match. The only consolation would be that Nasir notched up an ODI ton and also won Man of the Match. Their bowling has looked good, but has lacked an ability to go for the sucker punch when the situation demands it. These are the things that they need to work upon and will look to improve. What they said?Afridi has been batting in a sensible manner and that has contributed to the team really well. We shall look to test our bench strength in the next game?- Misbah-Ul-Haq, Pakistan skipper? Someone has to put up their hand in every match and perform. We shall think about promoting Shakib up the order as he is a key player for us?- Mushfiqur Rahim, Bangladesh skipperTeams: Bangladesh (From): Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Mahmudullah, Abdur Razzak, Alok Kapali, Elias Sunny, Farhad Reza, Imrul Kayes, Naeem Islam, Nasir Hossain, Nazmul Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar NafeesPakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Aizaz Cheema, Asad Shafiq, Imran Farhat, Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Khalil, Saeed Ajmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Akmal, Umar Gul, Younis KhanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
