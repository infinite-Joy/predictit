INDIA:6.6  Brett Lee to Gambhir, out Tendulkar Run Out!! Well well another controversial incident at the SCG. Back of a length delivery on the off stump, Gambhir tapped it towards point and rushed through for a quick single, Brett Lee for some reason ran half way down the pitch and then stood his ground. Warner ran in picked up the ball and under armed it to the stumps on the dive and hit. Tendulkar was short of his crease but he felt Lee obstructed him and he look quite disappointed and even signaled to the square leg umpire that he felt Lee was in his way. However, Taufel didn't have any hesitations in giving that out. He doesn't bother asking the Aussie captain to reconsider "in the spirit of cricket". Tendulkar run out (Warner) 14(15) [4s-2] Brett Lee to Gambhir, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Tendulkar has been run out! It seems as though Brett Lee stood in Tendulkar's way. Tendulkar had to run around Lee and in the process got run out but Lee really just stood his ground. Another question mark over the obstruction law and the spirit of cricket

INDIA:6.2 Brett Lee to Gambhir, leg byes, FOUR, short delivery, fast bouncer really! Gambhir has no idea of how to play it, the ball flicks the gloves and goes above the keeper's gloves. Gambhir looked all out of sorts there, umpire Bowden thought that went off the helmet and signalled leg byes. Gambhir showed the umpire his gloves since he wanted the runs, I'm not sure he would really want to claim runs for a shot like that!
INDIA:6.1  Brett Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run, shortish delivery outside the off stump, Tendulkar gets on top of the bounce and opens the face of the bat to guide it quite late down to third man
INDIA:5.6  Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, 3 runs, slightly fuller, Tendulkar drives it off the front foot along the ground to long off. The ball doesn't have enough pace on it to go to the boundary but the batsmen have enough pace in their legs to run three
INDIA:5.5  Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, no run, outside the off stump, Tendulkar lets it go through to the keeper
INDIA:5.4  Hilfenhaus to Tendulkar, FOUR, great timing! Slightly back of a length, Tendulkar drives it on the up off the back foot square of the wicket for a boundary

INDIA:4.3  Brett Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run, short of a length again, Tendulkar taps it to point and rushes through for a single, Mike Hussey underarms it towards the stumps at the striker's end. Had he hit Gambhir might have had to make the long walk back

INDIA:4.1  Brett Lee to Tendulkar, no run, slightly short on the off stump, Tendulkar gets on top of the bounce and taps it to pointIndia find themselves in a situation that they have become familiar with. Sehwag gone early, now Gambhir and Tendulkar have to rebuild

INDIA:2.5  Brett Lee to Gambhir, leg byes, FOUR, sliding down the leg side, the ball goes off the back pad to the fine leg boundary. For some odd reason Brett Lee decides to appeal for lbw but one would really need another set of stumps for that ball to hit the timber
INDIA:2.4  Brett Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run, goes off the outside edge to third man
INDIA:2.3  Brett Lee to Tendulkar, byes, FOUR, some insane amount of in swing after the ball had crossed Tendulkar! Pitched outside off stump and swung in to the right hander, Tendulkar let it go through to the keeper who tried to dive to his left and cover the swing, but the ball just went past him to the fine leg boundary
INDIA:2.2  Brett Lee to Tendulkar, no run, fuller outside the off stump, Tendulkar gets his front foot across the stumps and lets it go through to the keeper

INDIA:1.6 Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, out Caught&Bowled!! Brilliant catch! Sehwag's woes with the bat fail to cease! Pitched up this time, Sehwag tries to play a full blooded drive straight back past the bowler, but the bat turns in his hand and the ball goes in the air towards the bowler. Hilfenhaus bends down and takes a splendid catch. Sehwag c and b Hilfenhaus 5(11) [4s-1] Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!
INDIA:1.5  Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, no run, on a good length again, outside the off stump, Sehwag opens the face of the bat and drives it to the man at point

INDIA:1.4  Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, wide, down the leg side from Hilfenhaus
INDIA:1.3 Hilfenhaus to Sehwag, FOUR, he absolutely murdered that! That came right out of the meat of the bat! Not afraid to take the aerial route as usual, it was a length delivery outside off stump, Sehwag just slahes it off the back foot to sweeper cover for a boundary

INDIA:0.4  Brett Lee to Sehwag, no run, outside that off stump line again, and Sehwag has let this one go through to the keeper. I don't think he will let too many go through to that man behind the stumps though
INDIA:0.3  Brett Lee to Sehwag, no run, pitched up a little this time, on off stump, pitches and moves away just a shade. Sehwag tries to push at it but the ball beats his outside edge. Absolute ripper of a delivery!
INDIA:0.2  Brett Lee to Sehwag, no run, short outside off and finally Sehwag decides to let one go through to the keeper
INDIA:0.1  Brett Lee to Sehwag, no run, slightly short again just outside the line of the off stump, Sehwag tries to push at it on his toes but he gets beaten by the bounce
AUSTRALIA:0.1  Brett Lee to Sehwag, wide, short and wide outside off, Sehwag tries his level best to reach out for it and send it into orbit but the ball is just too wideSehwag and Tendulkar are at the crease. Sehwag is on strike. Brett Lee will open the attackThe players are back for the start of the second innings. I wonder what the line will be to Sehwag, wide outside off perhapsA funny one from Shashank: M.S Dhoni logs into FB account. 1 Notification. "Sehwag and Dhoni are now friends"But the talk of the innings will be the 'obstructing the field' appeal by India. Hussey stopped a throw with his gloves but the umpires ruled him not out, probably thinking that was more in self defence and giving the benefit of doubt to the batsmen. Hussey went on to make a half century after that. Will that turn out to be crucial? We'll find out in a while. Join us at 13:05 IST (18:25 local time) for the chase.An eventful Australian innings ends. India will be the happier team now. Warner scored a half century at the top but India kept getting wickets at regular intervals. 107-4 was the score when he departed, but David Hussey and Wade put on a steady 94 run stand in the middle overs and threatened to run away with the game. Both of them got to their half centuries and built a solid platform, but Umesh Yadav dismissed them in a span of 2 overs to trigger a lower order collapse. Australia were 199 for 4 in 39 overs, but a terrific spell in the death overs by Umesh Yadav and Virender Sehwag restricted them miraculously to 252.4
AUSTRALIA:49.6  Sehwag to Christian, out Caught by Ravindra Jadeja!! Christian holes out. This was there for him to be hit and he charged down the track, smashed it well but hit it flat and straight to long on. Yet another wicket for Sehwag, he has bowled an excellent spell despite that last over 6. Australia end up with a score just over 250. Christian c Ravindra Jadeja b Sehwag 24(32) [4s-2] Sehwag to Christian, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:49.5  Sehwag to Christian, 2 runs, well, must say that's a very very poor throw from Gambhir. This was heaved straight to him at deep square leg, there should have been only 1 but a weak throw from him allows Christian to come back for 2, maybe Dhoni was right, when he said that the slow fielders will be exploited..An appeal for run out. Christian the man in question. Not out is the verdict.
AUSTRALIA:49.4  Sehwag to Doherty, 1 run, fired in full outside off, Doherty drives it to deep extra cover for a single, Christian on strike now
AUSTRALIA:49.3  Sehwag to Doherty, SIX, that's the risk involved with bowling a part timer! Doherty knows that the line will be outside off so shuffles across and heaves it way over deep mid wicket, much needed blow
AUSTRALIA:49.2  Sehwag to Doherty, 2 runs, superb fielding by Kohli saves a couple! This was driven very well wide of extra cover, Virat runs across from sweeper cover and dives to stop it, excellent effort
AUSTRALIA:49.1  Sehwag to Doherty, 2 runs, loopy delivery outside off, Doherty goes on his knees and heaves it wide of long on for a coupleLast over of the innings. Can Australia get to 250? They looked good for 280+ at one stage. Sehwag to continue. Risky??
AUSTRALIA:48.6  Praveen Kumar to Christian, 2 runs, Christian knows that the length will be full and plays a premeditated scoop shot, doesn't get hold of it properly but manages a couple to fine leg, another excellent over ends
AUSTRALIA:48.5  Praveen Kumar to Doherty, 1 run, very full delivery on the off, Doherty jams it hard down the ground back to PK, he went with an outstretched right hand but only managed a half stop to mid off, looks like it has hurt PK's fingers slightly
AUSTRALIA:48.4  Praveen Kumar to Christian, 1 run, that's a poor ball but he gets away with it, a full toss on the legs, Christian swings across the line but hits it straight to fine leg, just a single!Last 10 overs: run rate 3.79
AUSTRALIA:48.3  Praveen Kumar to Doherty, 1 run, good lines again, full and straight stuff, Doherty flicks it with the angle past mid wicket for a single
AUSTRALIA:48.2  Praveen Kumar to Doherty, no run, very full from round the stumps, Doherty looks to drive through the off side but fails to hit it, that's another dot ball..PK and Dhoni have a chat. Some field changes..
AUSTRALIA:48.1  Praveen Kumar to Christian, 1 run, well bowled, sees Christian backing away and follows him with a yorker, he gets a slight inside edge which lobs off the boots to the off sidePraveen Kumar [9.0-1-31-2] is back into the attackarshi100: "Dhoni giving bowling to Sehwag to show that they ar united." Haha, whatever it is, the move seems to be working for India. Also, the move may have saved Dhoni from another ban in the future.
AUSTRALIA:47.6  Sehwag to Doherty, no run, what an over, just 2 runs and a wicket as well. Once again skiddy stuff on the stumps, Doherty manages to chop it to point
AUSTRALIA:47.5  Sehwag to Doherty, no run, flat and skiddy outside off, Doherty punches it to point, another dot ball..
AUSTRALIA:47.4  Sehwag to Christian, 1 run, given air on the middle and leg, Christian works it to deep backward square leg, only a singleXavier Doherty, left handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:47.3  Sehwag to Brett Lee, out Caught by Virat Kohli!! Another wicket for Sehwag and this is turning out to be a dream spell in the end. Lee comes down the track but Sehwag slows it up and drags it even shorter, he is not to the pitch of it but goes through with the heave, mistimes it to deep mid wicket where Kohli takes a good catch running to his right. India continue to strike in the death overs. Brett Lee c Virat Kohli b Sehwag 4(15) Sehwag to Brett Lee, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:47.2  Sehwag to Brett Lee, no run, flighted up around off, Lee punches hard but hits it straight to extra cover
AUSTRALIA:47.1  Sehwag to Christian, 1 run, flat and short on the middle and leg, Christian pulls it hard but straight to the fielder at deep mid wicket, just oneWill Sehwag continue to bowl? he did well in the last 2 overs he bowled but it may be a gamble now. Yes he will bowl..
AUSTRALIA:46.6  Umesh Yadav to Christian, leg byes, 1 run, length delivery that skids on, Christian is stuck in the crease and beaten for pace, goes off the thigh pad to the off side for a single
AUSTRALIA:46.5  Umesh Yadav to Christian, FOUR, nicely flicked. This was faster and fuller, Christian takes it off his pads and whips it along the ground wide of deep square leg, a much needed boundary for Australia
AUSTRALIA:46.4  Umesh Yadav to Christian, no run, another slower ball outside off, Christian mistimes a cut to the off side
AUSTRALIA:46.3  Umesh Yadav to Brett Lee, 1 run, full and wide outside off, Lee looks to slog over the on side but that's a slower ball, a single to long on
AUSTRALIA:46.2  Umesh Yadav to Christian, 1 run, banged in short but it hurries on, Christian mishits a pull to long on for one
AUSTRALIA:46.1  Umesh Yadav to Christian, no run, well stopped Umesh! Harsh people may call that a catch dropped. Length ball on the off, Christian absolutely blasts it straight back to Umesh, who somehow manages to not get injured!
AUSTRALIA:45.6  Sehwag to Brett Lee, no run, a half appeal for lbw, this was much closer than the previous appeal though, Lee once again misses a sweep but I guess that might have pitched outside leg again. Another brilliant over in the death by Viru
AUSTRALIA:45.5  Sehwag to Brett Lee, no run, floated around middle stump, Brett Lee defends it to the on side
AUSTRALIA:45.4  Sehwag to Christian, 1 run, flighted delivery on the middle and leg, Christian works it to square leg
AUSTRALIA:45.3  Sehwag to Brett Lee, 1 run, misfield by Gambhir but it doesn't cost anything, this was clipped to fine leg, there was always only 1 there but Gambhir runs in and misses the ball, for some reason Lee has run too far and can't take the 2nd run
AUSTRALIA:45.2  Sehwag to Brett Lee, no run, nice bowling, gives it flight and draws him forward, Lee uses his feet and awkwardly pushes to mid wicket
AUSTRALIA:45.1  Sehwag to Christian, 1 run, flighted up on the off, Christian sweeps it to deep square leg for one

AUSTRALIA:44.2  Umesh Yadav to Christian, no run, full and straight once again, Christian defends it with the angle to mid wicket
AUSTRALIA:44.1  Umesh Yadav to Christian, no run, good start, a yorker length ball on the off, Christian jams it back to the bowlerIndia are pulling things back in the final few overs. But they still have to get rid of Christian. He has shown in this series that he can be more than capable in the death..
AUSTRALIA:43.6  Sehwag to Brett Lee, no run, excellent over from Sehwag. Just 2 runs and a wicket from that one, ends it with a flat ball which Lee defends to the on side

AUSTRALIA:43.1  Sehwag to Clint McKay, out Stumped!! I was just wondering why Sehwag is bowling in the death but here's the reason. Gentle flight luring McKay forward, he overbalances as he pushes it and misses the ball as well, Dhoni is as quick as ever to whip the bails off. The third umpire was not even needed for that one. "Sehwag-Dhoni combination does it for India", says Sanjay Manjrekar. Haha! Clint McKay st Dhoni b Sehwag 1(2) Sehwag to Clint McKay, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!Virender Sehwag [5.0-0-23-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:42.6  Umesh Yadav to Christian, no run, good variations, slow off cutter on the off, Christian gets forward and blocks it, successful over for India ends
AUSTRALIA:42.5  Umesh Yadav to Christian, no run, better line and length, fast, full and straight, Christian gets a slight inside edge as he blocks
AUSTRALIA:42.4 Umesh Yadav to Christian, FOUR, not all short deliveries fetch wickets. Lesson learnt by Umesh. Too short this time, Christian stays in the crease and slaps it through deep mid wicket, huge gaps in that area too
AUSTRALIA:42.3  Umesh Yadav to Christian, no run, back of a length ball on the off, Christian stays back and blocks it
AUSTRALIA:42.2  Umesh Yadav to Clint McKay, 1 run, short of length around off, McKay hops back and guides it to third man, off the mark immediatelyClint McKay, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:42.1  Umesh Yadav to David Hussey, out Caught by Dhoni!! Uh oh, that's what you call a commentator's curse! Sorry David. Umesh bangs it in short and Hussey immediately goes for the pull shot, the ball bounces a touch extra and takes the edge to Dhoni. A huge, huge wicket this for India, could make a difference of around 30 runs easily! Umesh strikes again in the death overs, that's his second wicket of the day. David Hussey c Dhoni b Umesh Yadav 54(64) [4s-2] Umesh Yadav to David Hussey, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Umesh Yadav [3.0-0-26-1] is back into the attackAustralia look well set for a score around 280..they need Hussey there though
AUSTRALIA:41.6  Ashwin to David Hussey, 1 run, another carrom ball to end the over, Hussey stays back and flicks it to deep mid wicket, that ends Ashwin's spell: not too expensive but once again wicketless against Australia
AUSTRALIA:41.5  Ashwin to Christian, 1 run, floated around middle stump, Christian drives it hard to long on, another single
AUSTRALIA:41.4  Ashwin to Christian, no run, the carrom ball on the legs, Christian spots it well and defends it to the on side

AUSTRALIA:40.5  Ravindra Jadeja to David Hussey, 1 run, floated around off, Hussey drills it to long off for one
AUSTRALIA:40.4  Ravindra Jadeja to Christian, leg byes, 1 run, an appeal for lbw but that's probably sliding down the leg, he was struck on the backfoot but it was going down the leg with the angle, they sneak in a leg bye as it rolls to short fine
AUSTRALIA:40.3  Ravindra Jadeja to Christian, no run, flighted up on the middle and leg, Christian pushes it back to the bowler
AUSTRALIA:40.2  Ravindra Jadeja to Christian, no run, loopy on the off, Christian drives it back to Ravindra Jadeja
AUSTRALIA:40.1  Ravindra Jadeja to Christian, no run, a half appeal for bat-pad, Christian looks to defend but the ball pops up from his pads to Dhoni, no edge thereRavindra Jadeja [9.0-0-50-1] is back into the attackHussey is the danger man now, once again. Yet another half century for him. But here's another reaction to that 'obstructing the field' incident earlier, this time from Tony Greig: There is no way Hussey should have got away with that. It was obstruction simple as that. That decision could change the result of the match
AUSTRALIA:39.6  Umesh Yadav to Christian, 1 run, clipped to deep backward square leg off the pads to retain the strike

AUSTRALIA:23.6  Ashwin to Wade, 1 run, to cover, not out says the third umpire, didn't look intentional. Dhoni doesn't seem too happy at all, he's trying to really fight for his side of the story here. Wade had pushed it away to cover and scampered through for a single, Raina thew it at the striker's end and it struck Hussey. Hussey blocked the throw with his hand but that was more in self defence than anything else. Everything is settled now and the decision has been taken, one run to the batsmen and no wicket to the fielding sideOk there's an appeal from Dhoni here and it might be for obstructing the field, Raina threw the ball at the striker's end and Hussey looked to avoid the delivery but ended up getting in the way of the throw.

Praveen Kumar will open the attackSo the players are out in the middle for the start of playNo rotation policy today, so all 3 big guns are playing. Zaheer Khan and Vinay Kumar are injured, so Praveen Kumar gets a chance.Teams:India (Playing XI): Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Irfan Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Umesh YadavAustralia (Playing XI): David Warner, Shane Watson(c), Peter Forrest, Michael Hussey, David Hussey, Matthew Wade(w), Daniel Christian, Brett Lee, Clint McKay, Xavier Doherty, Ben HilfenhausDhoni: Watson brings stability to their side, but we have to worry about our own problems. Easy to calculate, you have to win both the games and qualify. We have to get partnerships when it comes to the batting. We haven't won tosses, we always want to bat first but are always chasing. In the first leg of the tournament, we wanted to rotate and experiment. Now we have to play the best eleven. It's good to have the big guys at the top order, we all know how dangerous they can be.Watson: Pitch looks beautiful. We have to see off the new ball and once we do it, it looks like a very nice wicket. Very excited to play, and to be captain of my country feels special. I'm feeling good, the last couple of weeks have been good and I'm ready to go. It's a must win game for us, really excited. Harris is out, Mckay returns.Australia have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: Conditions are very humid and there is a slight cloud covering. This is the same wicket where Sri Lanka thrashed Australia. There is no moisture, the 2 new balls will swing around. If India can play 2 spinners, they will get assistance. You have to see off the new ball, but it is a very good wicket. Win the toss and bat first, say Tom Moody and Wasim Akram.Now it is bad news for Australia: Michael Clarke will not play today because of a back injury. Shane Watson, who was out injured for the last couple of months, will return to the side and lead the team as well!Bad news for India: Zaheer Khan is out with an injury, and will not play today.Hello and welcome to our coverage of the game between Australia and India at Sydney. It is almost a must win game for India today (they will have an outside chance even if they lose). They will take on Australia, who have been up and down through the series. India's captain MS Dhoni mentioned yesterday that they will play the best available eleven, so let's wait and watch who plays and who doesn't. Stay tuned..Preview by  Ganesh CThe tri-series in Australia, which was scrapped a couple of years ago because of the long winding nature, had been revived again this year and they could not have asked for a better tournament. At this stage all three teams have a chance of qualifying for the finals. The three remaining games of the league stage will be watched with keen eyes by everyone. A lot of permutations will be in play too in the run up to the final. In case of a tie in the points table, the tournament rules give precedence to the most wins in the tournament, the most wins against the particular opponent, the most number of bonus points earned and the net run rate, in that order.Sri Lanka are relatively better placed at the moment. They have a chance of qualifying even if they lose their remaining two games. In that case, Australia will have to beat India and Sri Lanka themselves must ensure that they do not concede a bonus point against India. They need just one more win though to seal a spot in the final.Australia:Australia have been inconsistent throughout the tournament. They were hampered by the ineffectiveness of David Warner so far at the top of the order. With the impending return of Shane Watson, Warner will be under some pressure to perform. In all likelihood, Australia will persist with Warner for he has proved in the past that he can win games single handedly. Peter Forrest's consistent showing has also eased off some worries in the middle order after the sacking of Ricky Ponting.In fact, Australia will have a problem of plenty in batting if Warner is indeed accommodated and it will not be an easy decision for Michael Clarke to ask anyone to sit out. The batting unit looks very settled with Forrest, Clarke and the Hussey brothers in good touch and the only way to bring in Watson would be to leave out some one like Dan Christian.The bowling department has impressed in patches but it remains more of a concern for Clarke as he conceded after their loss against Sri Lanka. The pacemen have been rotated around but Australia are yet to settle upon the right balance. Lee, Hilfenhaus and Harris were not as effective as Clarke would have liked in the previous game and bringing in Shane Watson might could solve that problem as he gives the depth to the bowling. Xavier Doherty has grown in leaps and bounds to become a very good limited overs spinner. Clarke can afford to attack as well as defend with this canny left arm spinner.Road aheadThe loss against Sri Lanka has put Australia in a tough spot. Tomorrow's game against India at Sydney will be a big one for them. If they do win it then it assures them of a spot in the final. In fact like Sri Lanka, just one more win in the remaining two games assures them a spot. Like Sri Lanka, they can also qualify even after losing both their games. For that to happen Sri Lanka should beat India and Australia should not concede a bonus point against India.India:India are also under a lot of pressure with reports of a rift between the captain MS Dhoni and vice-captain, Virender Sehwag. The team management though has vehemently denied such reports but the constant pressure of clarifying to the media have taken the focus off the on-field cricket.India have more important problems to worry about. The rotation policy that they had adopted for the initial stages of the tournament citing long term goals has also resulted in India not finding a settled combination going into the crunch games. The problems begin right at the top. Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar have been pale shadows of their past in this series. Gautam Gambhir, who made two nineties, opening the innings will now have to bat at No 3 if India do go in with all three. The return of Dhoni (after serving a one match ban) though will be a big boost for the middle order. The skipper/keeper has been in terrific form in ODIs for over a year and India will need him to be at his best for the remaining games.Like Australia, India too have a few problems in picking their best bowling group. Vinay Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Irfan Pathan and Praveen Kumar have all contributed in some games but none of them will be a shoo in into the final eleven. The only man who would have been so, Zaheer Khan is out due to a calf injury. It can be expected that MS Dhoni would go in with both Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin in spin friendly conditions at the Sydney Cricket Ground.The other interesting aspect would be to see how the Indians, the seniors in particular, respond to this big challenge that awaits them.Road aheadThe equation is the simplest for India. They have to win both their remaining games to progress to the final. Even one loss will put them in jeopardy. If they do lose the game against Australia, then they should beat Sri Lanka with a bonus point. In this case they will need Australia to beat Sri Lanka too.Quotes:All three (Gambhir, Sehwag and Tendulkar) score at a brisk pace, they are good at hitting boundaries as well as in taking singles - MS DhoniIt's the start of his career and there's a long way to go, but he's got a lot of potential. He's got a lot of talent. He plays spin and fast bowling well - Michael Clarke on Peter ForrestTeams:India (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Gautam Gambhir, Ravindra Jadeja, Zaheer Khan, Virat Kohli, Praveen Kumar, Parthiv Patel, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, Virender Sehwag, Rohit Sharma, Rahul Sharma, Sachin Tendulkar, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay Kumar, Umesh YadavAustralia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Matthew Wade(w), Shane Watson, Daniel Christian, Xavier Doherty, Peter Forrest, Ryan Harris, David Hussey, Michael Hussey, Brett Lee, Clint McKay, Mitchell Marsh, Mitchell Starc, Ricky Ponting, David Warner, George Bailey, Jon Holland, Ben HilfenhausLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
