It is more chilly in Lahore than here. Everybody is fit. We are taking it one game at a time. Umar Akmal replaces Azhar Ali in the team."Dhoni: "We will bat first. The conditions are not going to change much. It is really cold and we have managed to keep warm. Nobody is unfit for selection. I had a sore back but I am alright. We need to win one game. Sehwag and Dinda make way for Rahane and Shami Ahmed."Dhoni is playing in this match.India have won the toss and elected to batThe big question is, will MS Dhoni play in this match? There were reports that he is suffering from a sore back and he is in doubt for this ODI.Pitch Report: The temperature is about two degrees celsius. The pitch has been rolled in and it looks flat. The grass is evenly distributed but it looks dry. Wasim Akram says, "The pitch reminds me of the Gaddhafi stadium in Lahore. The wicket is dry and the team that wins the toss should bowl first."A warm welcome to one and all for the third and final ODI between India and Pakistan from Delhi. A warm welcome is a bit of a misnomer considering the fact that it is very cold in Delhi. Pakistan have already clinched the series 2-0 and will be attempting a whitewash. India, on the other hand, will be looking to play for pride. The toss is a few minutes away.Preview by Nikhil NarainSometimes when the chips are down, when one has nothing to lose and when there is no deeper that one can fall, then one rises from adversity, lets go of inhibitions and showcases ones true potential. India would hope that they can pull up one such performance when they take on Pakistan in a dead rubber third and final ODI at the Ferozshah Kotla in Delhi. With the series already lost 2-0, the home team would need to play for pride and honour. India: Nothing seems to be going right for the hosts. Their miserable run in the longer format has now rubbed off on their performances in ODIs and T2OIs too. The morale and the confidence is low. Adding to that, there are reports of rifts and controversies and the existence of different factions within the team. India needs to rise above these petty quarrels, get their act together and come out as a cohesive unit and show some gusto and fight when they face a buoyed up Pakistani side for the last time in the series. Ajinkya Rahane would surely get a look in, in place of Gautam Gambhir while Amit Mishra might replace Ashok Dinda. There is further depressing news from the Indian camp as skipper MS Dhoni, who has been in splendid form, might sit out due to a back soreness. Dinesh Karthik has already been called in as cover. If Dhoni plays, he should definitely promote himself up the order to No. 4. The top order needs to fire for India. Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina need to come good. Pakistan: The visitors would hope to leave the Indian shores on a high and will come down hard on the home team in order to complete a whitewash. In Mohammad Hafeez and Nasir Jamshed, they have one of the best opening pairs in ODI cricket. The middle order has been a cause of some worry but Pakistan would bank on the experience of Younis Khan and skipper, Misbah-ul-Haq to come good. Umar Akmal might get a chance with Azhar Ali looking out of sorts in the first two ODIs. The bowling looks a class apart and Umar Gul, Junaid Khan and Saeed Ajmal might again prove to be a handful for the Indians. Watch out for: Mohammad Hafeez has been in tremendous form with the bat and on a slow and low Kotla wicket, the all-rounder could cause a worry or two for the Indian line-up with his off-spinners. Conclusion: The Kotla will once again become the center-stage for diplomacy between the 2 nations with a number of dignitaries from both India and Pakistan set to be present at the venue. India need to find some inspiration from somewhere which would provide them with a ray of hope in the chilly freezing conditions of the Capital. If they fail to do so, they might just shiver in the cold and darkness!Teams:India (From): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ashok Dinda, Ishant Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Amit Mishra, Shami AhmedPakistan (From): Nasir Jamshed, Mohammad Hafeez, Azhar Ali, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal(w), Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Zulfiqar Babar, Umar Akmal, Imran Farhat, Wahab Riaz, Anwar Ali, Haris SohailLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
