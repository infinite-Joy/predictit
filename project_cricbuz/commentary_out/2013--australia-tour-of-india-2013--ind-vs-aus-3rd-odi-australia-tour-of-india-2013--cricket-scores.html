Here we go for the first ball!We are set for play to begin. The umpires make their way out to the centre. This is only the second time in their last 28 outings that Australia have sent India in after winning the toss.Teams chosing to bowl here have won only 3 games out of 12.This is the 22nd ODI at this ground and India have won 8 out of their 12 games here. Australia have played India thrice before at this venue and have beaten them twice. In 2006, Australia beat India by 6 wickets after India opted to bat and then in 2009, they won by 24 runs after India opted to field.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Vinay Kumar, Ishant SharmaAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Shane Watson, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay, Xavier DohertyDhoni: "We are going in with the same team. We were looking to bowl first because of the dew factor. But it is good that the bowlers will get some exposure today. The pitch has a decent grass cover. Usually it is a good batting track but at the same time there will be something for the quicks. It is difficult for the bowlers with 5 fielders in the ring. Especially the spinners, they try to bowl flat and flat and of course the T20 influence is always there."Bailey: "3 from 3 (on winning the toss), we are having a bowl today. It is a very beautiful wicket. The dew can come in late, we've played some good cricket. Happy with where we are. We are going with the same XI. It is a hard ground to defend."Australia have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe Indian batsmen chased down a mammoth target of 360 with 39 balls to spare in the last ODI. First, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan put on a record 176-run opening stand which is the highest for India against Australia. Then, the former was joined by Virat Kohli who didn't put a foot wrong. He also went on to register the fastest ODI hundred by an Indian in just 52 balls eclipsing Virender Sehwag's 60-ball ton against New Zealand. In the end, the three youngsters not only helped India square the 7-match ODI series, but also ensured that India recorded the second highest run chase in the history of ODIs.Toss and teams in a few minutes...Stay tuned...Both India and Australia boast of a solid batting line-up, having given batting performances in excess of 300 in the first two games. However, inconsistent bowling has troubled both the teams and they will be looking to address these problems.A warm welcome for the 3rd ODI between India and Australia at Mohali. After Australia put an end to India's 8-match winning streak in the first game, the hosts bounced back strongly to slaughter the visitors with an emphatic 9-wicket victory at Jaipur. With the series levelled, both teams will be looking forward to extend their advantage at Mohali. Toss will be crucial as the dew factor will likely come into play.Preview by Rajarshi GuptaSince Sachin Tendulkar announced his decision to retire from Test cricket last week, a few significant developments have taken place around the Indian team, developments that bode well for the world champions in the years to come. First was Yuvraj Singh's comeback into the Indian team and what a comeback it was. The southpaw hammered the Australians as India chased down a score in excess of 200 for the second time in T20 Internationals. A few days later, aided by Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, who scored the fastest ODI ton by an Indian and Shikhar Dhawan, India blazed down a target of 360, the second highest successful run chase in the history of ODI cricket. All of this has of course happened in the current series against Australia. After two games, both teams have won one each and despite India's mediocre bowling, the hosts suddenly look far more formidable with their batsmen threatening to set new standards in modern day cricket.India: After being completely overplayed in the first ODI, the historic win in the second would have done India a lot of good. They will now have much needed momentum going further into the series but the bowlers will have their task cut out after leaking more than 300 in successive matches. Ishant Sharma has been a huge concern and the lanky Delhi pacer is fast running out of time while Vinay Kumar, who has been around long enough in international cricket, needs to bowl with more common sense. A bowler of his pace has been digging in way too much of the short stuff and on flat tracks, the Australians have been only too glad to accept an open invitation to hit out. Bhuvneshwar Kumar has been an exception, bowling some tight spells with the new ball but his inability to strike early and failure at the death overs have left a lot to be desired. R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have been ineffective but the two spinners will come into play on slower, drier tracks.The batsmen will carry their confidence into Mohali and no matter how the pitch behaves, India's top five will be a dangerous unit and after the debacle in the first game, they will not buckle down against Australia's short-ball-tactics.Australia: George Bailey had revealed Mitchell Johnson was categorically asked to intimidate India's batsmen but by the end of India's innings in Jaipur, it was Johnson (9-1-0-68) and his bowling colleagues, who were intimidated, scared and flustered after the most brutal assault in recent times. How they manage to bounce back from the nine-wicket slaughter will be interesting to see. The PCA Stadium has traditionally favoured seam bowlers and Australia will be hoping they do not run into another belter.Australia's batsmen have been phenomenal and such has been their touch that Michael Clarke, their regular captain, has not been missed at least in the batting line-up. Bailey and Aaron Finch have stepped up and are looking in great form against an Indian attack that has lacked control, planning and any skills to work in the death. Weather and Pitch: It should be a perfect day for cricket with bright sunshine forecast for the next few days. Unlike Jaipur, Mohali will be far more pleasant with the onset of winter in North India. The PCA stadium pitch has generally offered a bit more bounce as compared to the other grounds and the wicket for the 3rd ODI will be expected to aid the pacers.Quotes:Unlike earlier times when we used to think that too many runs had been scored, these days with great team effort we can make it: Shikhar Dhawan feels chasing down 300+ targets is a common thing of late in ODI cricket.Personally, I like to back the group we have. I want to give them a chance and I feel they can get on top of that Indian batting line-up: Australia captain, George Bailey expects his bowlers to do a better job.Teams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Vinay Kumar, Amit Mishra, Ambati Rayudu, Mohammed Shami, Jaydev UnadkatAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Shane Watson, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay, Xavier Doherty, Moises Henriques, Callum Ferguson, Nathan Coulter-NileLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
