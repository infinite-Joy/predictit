Tharanga is on strike. Lee will open the attackThe Aussies are out in the middle, the pitch is a bit damp and Sri Lanka have struggled so far with the bat in the series. This is going to be a stern test of their technique under helpful bowling conditions.Marvan Atapattu: I use something called side-arm, it is very easy on the arm, especially during the fielding and throwing. It is very easy to practise throwing using this device. The seniors in the team are quite aware of their responsibilities, it is the juniors who need the support. We are aware that our batting has not lived upto expectations. We are playing against the No. 1 team in the world, we have some changes in the batting order today. hopefully things will be good for us today.Ricky Ponting:  I am enjoying just being one of the members of the team and working under Michael. The team is pretty good and we are looking to continue with the success. I felt that the time was ripe for Clarke to take over the captaincy after the World Cup. The Bangladesh series was just the start. We had a pretty long break (3 and a half months). It has allowed us to be fresh and raring to go. My fingers are pretty good right now though it was a bit ginger during the World Cup. It is great to be contributing to the team as a fielder and I am having a great time indeed. I'm looking forward to the impending birth of my second child, keeping an eye open while sleeping and hoping to hop over on a plane when that happens. But these are the sacrifices that one has to make when playing for the country. I took the plates and the wire out of my fingers after the World Cup. When I was batting during the World Cup, every time I felt like batting with a broken hand. I have seen the surgeon and now it feels a lot better.Pitch Report: This is a new pitch. It was watered 2 days ago, but has been under covers since then. There should be a lot of help for the seamers. The team winning the toss well definitely choose to bowl first. The pitch will stay good and the team batting first will look to score at least 250.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Chamara Silva, Shaminda Eranga, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Jeevan MendisAustralia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke(c), Michael Hussey, David Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Xavier Doherty, Doug BollingerDilshan: There is a little bit of moisture in the wicket. We wanted to bowl but we need to bat well and post a decent score. We have made two changes, Mathews misses out due to an injury and we have left out Herath. Chamara Silva and Shaminda Eranga will play in their place. Eranga will make his ODI debut as well.Clarke: They was a bit of rain yesterday. We expect some moisture on the wicket and hence the decision to bowl. We are going with the same team that has done so well until now.Australia have won the toss and elected to fieldSri Lanka are wilting under the immense pressure exerted by the Australians as they trail the 5 match ODI series at 2-0. It is do or die for them today in the 3rd ODI. A win will keep their hopes alive of winning the ODI series, a loss today will mean that they will have only pride to play for in the next 2 matches at Colombo. Hello, and welcome to the 3rd ODI between Sri Lanka and Australia from Hambantota. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates..Preview by Gokul GopalWhen Sri Lanka started the series on a wining note, clinching the T20 games 2-0, they might have thought that everything was falling in place and the grass was looking healthily green for the home team. But little did they know that an experienced Australian outfit, with a forgettable recent past, were bent upon to prove a point. And so they did by winning the first two One-Dayers, leaving the home team with a must-win situation to stay alive in the series.Australia: Michael Clarke, according to many, was not quite the captaincy material, matching up to the greats who skippered the 'Team in Yellow' during their dominant years. But the current Aussie skipper has somewhat squashed those notions by leading his team from the front in the ongoing series and, with the help of his teammates, has put Australia on a new path towards success. After the loss in the T20 games, things did not look all that great for the Australians and their weakness against spin bowling was something that the home team was looking to capitalize upon. However, it did not go as per plans for the Lankans as they had to go up against an experienced Australian top order, which did not fall for the trick. Ricky Ponting's new role as just a top-order batsman worked splendidly ( 53 and 90*) for the team in the two ODIs and Clarke, with a couple of unbeaten half-centuries, took his team through to the end. Shane Watson too played his part by getting the team off to a rapid start in both the matches and the people down the order, completed the good work provided at the top.While the Australian batting is to be complimented for the intelligent approach, the bowlers were the main reason that the likes of Watson, Ponting and Clarke could have a comfortable outing at the middle. Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee and Doug Bollinger did not let the Lankans have an easy time at the middle while, the spinners too played their part by keeping things tight and not let the noose go free. All that can be said, after witnessing the first two ODIs, is that the Australians have made their battle plans ready before setting foot on the Sri Lankan soil and have now stamped their authority.Sri Lanka: Tillakaratne Dilshan and his men wouldn't have had a good day's sleep after being forced into a make-or-break situation. The batsmen are to blame for the home team's current state of consternation as they failed to deliver in two consecutive games. And no one in particular can be blamed for the failure as the Lankan side has collectively failed to click as a batting unit. A good start by the openers in the first game was wasted by the ones to follow as the hosts were bowled out for 191 while, Sagakkara with his fighting half-century managed to take the total to 208 in the second match, although it was in vain. What was common in both these matches was that the home team opted to bat first and had lost half their side for less than 150 runs. All Dilshan would be hoping for is that his batters, including himself, come up with a solid effort and prevent the Aussies from clinching the series in straight games.The Sri Lankan bowling missed Lasith Malinga in the opening game but he did not make much of a difference when he was part of the playing eleven in the 2nd ODI. Nuwan Kulasekara contributed more with the bat than with the ball in both the matches, and it was not his fault that he and his fellow bowlers did not have much of a total to defend. Even the spinners, who were the main weapons against the Aussies, were handled with ease by the experienced tourists. All that the Lankan bowlers would now be hoping is for the batsmen to do their job well to enable them put the pressure back on the visitors.Numbers:2004: This was the year that Australia last won an ODI series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. Australia won the series 3-2.2009: This was the year that Sri Lanka last lost an ODI series at home. India defeated Sri Lanka by 4 games to 1.What the former skippers say:I am getting a few runs, so not being captain must be working out okay. Michael Clarke is doing a fine job, and I am getting used to sitting in a corner and being told what to do: Ricky Ponting.The Aussies have been able to apply sustained pressure on our batsmen and our inability to post competitive totals means that we have not been able to do the same to their batsmen:  Kumar Sangakkara.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Upul Tharanga, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Kulasekara, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Suranga Lakmal, Suraj Randiv, Thissara Perera, Chamara Silva, Shaminda ErangaAustralia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting, Michael Hussey, Shaun Marsh, David Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Steven Smith, Brett Lee, Doug Bollinger, Xavier Doherty, John Hastings, James PattinsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
