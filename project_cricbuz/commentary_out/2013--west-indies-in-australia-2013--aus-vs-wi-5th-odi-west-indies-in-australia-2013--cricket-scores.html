The hosts, having already taken the series comfortably, will be looking for a 5-0 clean sweep at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. For West Indies, this is their final chance for redeeming some of the lost pride. The hosts will be without the services of Michael Clarke for this game as he complained of a recurrence of a hamstring problem. Shane Watson will be captaining the home team in place of Clarke. George Bailey's fitness is still a concern and in case he does not recover from a hamstring injury, Australia are likely to include Shaun Marsh. With Glenn Maxwell also having flown to India, Australia are likely to give Xavier Doherty a game. Meanwhile, Chris Gayle is still a doubtful starter for the Windies while Tino Best, who bowled well in the previous game, is likely to retain his place. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates.Teams:Australia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Brad Haddin(w), Ben Cutting, James Faulkner, Phillip Hughes, Clint McKay, Mitchell Starc, George Bailey, Xavier Doherty, Aaron Finch, Mitchell Johnson, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade, Shane Watson, Adam Voges, Nathan Coulter-NileWest Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Johnson Charles(w), Tino Best, Chris Gayle, Sunil Narine, Kieran Powell, Andre Russell, Devon Thomas, Dwayne Bravo, Narsingh Deonarine, Jason Holder, Kieron Pollard, Kemar Roach, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Darren BravoLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
