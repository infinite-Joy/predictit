SRI LANKA:7.1 Riaz to Dilshan, no run, fullish delivery on the off stump, Dilshan drives it to mid-onWelcome back. Play about to resume!Even though Tharanga has been dismissed, this is just the start Sri Lanka wanted. Dilshan batted aggressively for a while before the Pakistani seamers found the right lengths.

SRI LANKA:6.6 Irfan to Tharanga, out Bowled!! Tharanga is dismissed at the stroke of the lunch break. Full and wide outside off stump, Tharanga drives but drags it back onto the stumps.

SRI LANKA:3.6 Riaz to Dilshan, no run, another appeal for LBW, not given. Height was the issue I guess. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, Dilshan misses the pull again and gets hit on the pad. Good comeback over from Riaz after conceding 14 runs in his first over

SRI LANKA:3.1 Riaz to Dilshan, no run, did appeal for a catch put the umpire off from calling it a wide? No, it hit the thigh pad and that's a good call. Short of a length delivery down the leg side, Dilshan failed to glance it away

SRI LANKA:2.2 Irfan to Tharanga, 1 run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Tharanga gets an inside edge onto pad, the ball rolls to point, they go for the run but Dilshan doesn't bother to quickly make his ground, lazily drags his bat into the crease and gets lucky despite Fawad Alam firing a direct-hitA lazy effort from Dilshan could see him walk back. Third umpire called for a run-out check. Oh that's really close and maybe a frame is going to save Dilshan. NOT OUT called and Dilshan survives!
SRI LANKA:2.1 Irfan to Tharanga, FOUR, while Dilshan is all about muscular blows, this man Tharanga puts the emphasis on timing. Allows the good length delivery to come and drives it past the bowler to pick up four
SRI LANKA:1.6 Riaz to Dilshan, FOUR, thank you very much says Dilshan and punches this nicely off the back foot through extra-cover. Massive over this for Sri Lanka, 14 runs off it. Not learning his lessons there Riaz, continues to bowl short and perish
SRI LANKA:1.5 Riaz to Dilshan, no run, much better from Riaz. Short of a length delivery close to the off stump, defended off the back foot

SRI LANKA:0.6 Irfan to Dilshan, no run, play and a miss. Tries to run the short of length delivery down to third man but gets beaten
SRI LANKA:0.5 Irfan to Dilshan, no run, good leave. Short of a length and rising steeply, Irfan angles it across the right-hander and hence Dilshan takes his bat out of the way to let it go
SRI LANKA:0.4 Irfan to Dilshan, FOUR, off the mark in grand style! Short delivery on the off stump, Dilshan swivels across and pulls it handsomely along the ground to the deep square leg fence

Irfan will open the attackWe are all set for the Sri Lankan reply to begin... Two slips in place.Lowest ever score for Pakistan in Sri Lanka. This is also their 2nd lowest score against Sri Lanka. A rather dispiriting performance from the visitors. They opted to bat first and never seemed to get going. Sharjeel Khan looked like a fish out of water, Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez blocked everything that came their way before being dismissed. Fawad Alam and Misbah-ul-Haq resisted for a while, but Pakistan collapsed after their skipper was run-out. Fawad just watched from the other end as batsman after batsman fell to reckless shots, none more than Umar Akmal and Shahid Afridi. They were 81/8 when rain came to offer them a reprieve. The visitors limped past 100 before being bundled out in the 33rd over. Simple task on hand for Sri Lanka. Can Pakistan do better with the ball? Join us in a while..3
PAKISTAN:32.1 Herath to Irfan, out Bowled!! Herath needed just one ball to finish off things. Ugly mow from Irfan, this was tossed up and on the off-stump line, Irfan lost his patience, goes for a big heave over mid-wicket and misses.

We are set for the start of the final day of Pakistan's tour of Sri Lanka..Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Sharjeel Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Umar Akmal(w), Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Fawad Alam, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Mohammad IrfanSri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Seekkuge Prasanna, Ashan Priyanjan, Thisara Perera, Dhammika Prasad, Rangana Herath, Lasith MalingaMathews: "I would have batted first as well, but I am not concerned about it. The body language has to be positive, we are playing to win this game. Got to be patient with the likes of Lasith and Kula, they will be rusty for a while as we are playing after a longish break. We've got one change, Kula makes way for Dhammika."Misbah: 'We will bat. Just one change. Saeed Ajmal comes in for Junaid Khan. Ajmal is a key bowler for us, he takes wickets whenever we need them. We have had some problems in the last 10 overs of the innings, and Saeed will fit in nicely there. We didn't want to drop a batsman. Anything around 260-270 will be a good total.'Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: 'The pitch is quite dry, but the ball will come onto the bat nicely. It should be a good batting strip and the team winning the toss will opt to bat first. A total around 275 will be very challenging, reckons Russel Arnold.The good news is that it is bright and sunny out there right now and the forecast is very good for the day. It'll be interesting to see the team combinations of both the sides. Toss and more coming up very shortly. Stay tuned...It's the decider today and there's no doubt that both teams would be playing hard to get the better of each other. If Pakistan snatched victory from behind in the first ODI, Thisara Perera's all-round show helped the hosts draw level in the second. Pakistan skipper Misbah-ul-Haq had earlier revealed that his side was badly missing the services of Saeed Ajmal and I am sure he'd be delighted to have him back in the side as Ajmal has returned from Australia, where his bowling action went under the scanner.Teams:Pakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Sharjeel Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Umar Akmal(w), Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Fawad Alam, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Talha, Zulfiqar Babar, Anwar AliSri Lanka (From): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Ashan Priyanjan, Thisara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Suraj Randiv, Dhammika PrasadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
