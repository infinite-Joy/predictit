One must fancy India to chase this down quite easily, but funnier things have happened in cricket. Here we go.NZ have to thank Nathan McCullum and James Franklin for a wonderful rescue act. Their 94 run partnership has ensured that NZ end up at a very decent 224/9 after being reduced to 106/7 at one stage. The Indian bowlers were spot on at the start as the moisture in the wicket helped them wreck the Kiwi top order. Zak and Munaf were wonderful with the new ball and Yusuf Pathan chipped in later with a couple of wickets. However, the batting PP boosted NZ as they scored 40 runs in quick time. The Indians will be looking to get off to a good start on a pitch that is becoming easier to bat on. Can the openers flay the Kiwi bowling to all parts of the ground? Or will NZ pull something out of the bag? Join us at 13:10 PM IST for the run chase...4

NEW ZEALAND:0.1  Zaheer to Guptill, 1 run, starts off with a fuller delivery nipping back in from outside off, the ball takes the inner half and rolls wide of mid on, off the mark straight awayGuptill and Brendon McCullum are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackTeams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Kane Williamson, James Franklin, Gareth Hopkins(w), Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Andy McKayIndia (Playing XI): Murali Vijay, Gautam Gambhir(c), Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Yusuf Pathan, Ravindra Jadeja, Wriddhiman Saha(w), Ravichandran Ashwin, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Munaf PatelVettori: We would have batted first too. We have to make the most of the powerplays and keep wickets in hand. Brendon is back in the side but he won't keep wickets. Franklin comes in for Southee. Anything over 280 will be a good score.Gambhir: The wicket looks a bit sticky and we have 3 real good bowlers in our side. We would look to make the most of the juice in the wicket. Zaheer comes in place of Sreesanth and Ravindra Jadeja has come in place of Raina.India have won the toss and elected to fieldZaheer Khan is back in the squad, he is going through his practice drills, he must get a game in straight away.Pitch report: The wicket has a red tinge to it, looks like a batting paradise, it has a real good feel to it. The top surface is a bit damp, the ball may do something early on. Big scores have been knocked down on this wicket, the average score is on the high 270s, so it will be a tough ground to defend feels Simon Doull.Simon Doull: NZ have got a couple of changes, I hope they do well and change things around here today. Ross Taylor has to come up the order, he hasn't scored a hundred in his last 42 ODIs, he has to take some pressure off Willamson. The crowd will be in for a good day. I think Elliot offers the same as Scott Styris, they roll their fingers across and bowl a lot of slower deliveries. Franklin coming back will be a good sign for the Kiwis. Brendon McCullum will be back but Hopkins will play as a keeper.Hello folks, a warm welcome to one and all for the live coverage of the 3rd ODI between India and NZ.It's been a successful mission domination so far for the young Indian team who have outplayed NZ in all departments in the first two ODIs. With a win here, India will take an unassailable 3-0 lead while NZ would look to bounce back and regain some form before their build up to the World Cup.This is Ajith and I'll bring you all the action along with Shashank and Sid V. Don't go away we'll be back with more updates...by Saurabh SomaniWith two wins from two matches, India are in the luxurious position of having the time and space to experiment with different combinations in the coming ODIs against New Zealand - which was the basic idea behind resting the seniors and picking a relatively inexperienced team to start with. That the team has delivered will be of great cheer to fans, but it is important to remember that the series has not yet been won, and the opposition is rather weak.
Off the last 8 ODIs that saw a result for them, New Zealand have now lost all 8 and that is a very worrying sign for them. Their problem has always been an inability to produce an all-round good performance. Seldom have all batsmen or all bowlers clicked together, and if by some miracle the batsmen have all clicked the bowlers have let them down and vice versa. Their fans might have believed that the reverse in Bangladesh was an aberration, but based on their results so far, it has seemed an ominous portent rather than an aberration. Also, aberrations occur for a match or at most two matches - not for so many matches in a row. New Zealand can point to the fact that they are missing Brendon McCullum and Jesse Ryder, but with the ultimate goal of the 2011 World Cup in mind, a team has to have the resources to adequately fill the shoes of any missing first-choice members. The World Cup is going to be a long tournament, and an injury or two are almost guaranteed. What New Zealand have shown is that unless they are at full strength, it will be almost impossible for them to consistently string together victories. The primary focus for New Zealand in this and the remaining matches should be to get the players who would be on the bench if their first eleven was fit to become more match-ready.
Amongst the best things for the Indian team has been the return of Zaheer Khan. While Zaheer is undoubtedly the prime strike bowler for India in Tests, he hasn't been quite as devastating in ODIs. However, a Zaheer who finds his line and length consistently will still be India's best weapon in ODIs too, so it is essential that he get into the rhythm of sub-continental ODI cricket again with these three ODIs against New Zealand. Since Sreesanth has been rested, Zaheer for Sreesanth becomes one of the straight swaps. Suresh Raina being given a rest means though that Saurabh Tiwary could get a look in, while amongst the bowlers Nehra, Praveen Kumar and Munaf will battle for two spots. The combination could come down to whether Zaheer prefers bowling first change or with the new ball. If Zaheer takes the new ball, Munaf is likely to pip Praveen Kumar into the eleven, since he is a better first change bowler than Praveen is. If, however, Zaheer does not take the new ball then it should be shared between Nehra and Praveen.
The combinations from India might change, but the intensity is not likely to.
