Anderson will open the attackWe are all set to resume... This should be an easy chase for the ProteasAn ordinary performance from England has resulted in them being bowled out inside 50 overs. They opted to bat and were off to a poor start when Bell and Bopara were out in the same over. They couldn't consolidate from that position even though their skipper Cook got to a half century. They lost wickets in the middle and never looked like they would post a decent total. Peterson bowled well and took 3 for 37, with rest of the bowlers giving him good support. SA will look to chase this down quickly and level and series. Do join us in about 40 minutes for the chase....4

The main question for England is, who will replace Trott? Bairstow or Buttler? What will be the composition of the South African team for this final match?Welcome to the fifth and final ODI between England and South Africa from Trent Bridge. England have already sealed the No.1 ranking in ODIs and they will look to cap it off by winning their third consecutive ODI bilateral series against South Africa. South Africa, on the other hand, will look to bounce back and square the series. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Vishaal LoganathanSouth Africa have all to do in the final game against hosts England when the teams meet at Nottingham for the 5th ODI to decide the winner of the series. England already have one hand on the cup with a unassailable 2-1 lead and take the momentum with them having registered 2 wins on the trot. South Africa have suffered quite a bit thanks to their wobbly middle order and will be hoping the team puts up a much better performance this time around.EnglandEngland will go into the final game with a definite upper-hand having won the last two games in handsome fashion. England dominance has stemmed from the fact that their batting line-up has been in good form, barring a few minor hiccups. Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott and Eoin Morgan have all been in good form and with the likes of Alastair Cook, Craig Kieswetter and Ravi Bopara to support them, England will not worry much about their run-making.Their bowlers too have given the home fans much to smile about, Jade Dernbach, Jimmy Anderson and James Tredwell have all contributed heavily with the ball and that will look to continue their form in the final game.England's major worry will be the form of Ravi Bopara but the right hander has chipped in with the ball which should help him keep his place in the XI.South AfricaThe Proteas' batting has left a lot to be desired. The team has been heavily dependent on Hashim Amla and even though the classy right-hander has sparkled the rest have only flattered to deceive. Barring Amla, none of the batsmen have been able to cross the 100 run mark in the matches played so far. South Africa will have to pull up their socks and deliver a much improved batting performance if they are to tie the series.On the bowling front, South Africa do not have any major concerns but will hope one of their main bowlers hit top form in the final game.
