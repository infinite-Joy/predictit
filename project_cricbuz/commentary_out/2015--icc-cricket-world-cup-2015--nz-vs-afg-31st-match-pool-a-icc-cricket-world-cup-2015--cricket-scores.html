Guptill is on strike. Dawlat Zadran will open the attackWelcome back. The Kiwi openers are making their way out to the middle. The Afghan players are also out there. Guptill will take the strike first up. Dawlat Zadran will open the bowling. There are two slips in placeFor the Black Caps, Vettori was the pick of the bowlers. The tall left-arm spinner took 4/18 in his 10 overs. He was simply superb with the ball and never allowed the Afghan batsmen to take control of the game when he was on. In fact, during the course of this game, Vettori became the first New Zealand bowler to complete 300 ODI wickets. Boult gave him good support, picking 3 wickets for 34. Now, it is upto their batsmen to make it 5 consecutive wins in the World Cup. Join us in a short while to follow the Kiwi run-chase.However, Najibullah came out all guns blazing and looked to take the attack to the opposition. His six off Southee that he sent sailing out of the park was a treat to watch. Both Shenwari and Najibullah batted superbly in those middle overs and were looking good enough to take their team past 200, but Najibullah holed out to third man after a 86-run partnership, while trying to up the ante. He got out on a run-a-ball 56. Dawlat Zadran also failed to put any kind of partnership with Shenwari and got out for 1. Shenwari then took the responsibility of taking the attack to the opposition, but he also threw away his wicket after bringing up his 10th ODI fifty. In the end, Afghanistan were bowled out for 186 , but only after Hamid Hassan entertained the crowd with some good blows. He eventually got out to a great catch from Milne.Afghanistan got off to a poor start, losing both their openers when the team score read 6. Boult and Southee bowled tight lines and lengths as they kept good pressure on the Afghan batsmen. Stanikzai too failed to hold one end and perished for just 9. Mangal and Shenwari then put on 25 for the 4th wicket, before Vettori outfoxed Mangal and bowled him. Afghanistan then lost 2 more wickets in a space of 10 runs and were reeling at 59/6 at one stage.4

Here we go then...Pitch Report: 'It's swirling around the ground a little bit. As far as the surface is concerned, it is a used one. There are no demons in the pitch. There is just a nice little covering of grass, but it's fairly even. It won't be a quick wicket, but a medium paced one,' reckons Simon DoullTeams:Afghanistan (Playing XI): Javed Ahmadi, Usman Ghani, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai(w), Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor ZadranNew Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Trent BoultAfghanistan have won the toss and have opted to batMcCullum: 'Last weekend was a fair bit of spectacle. I think everyone thoroughly enjoyed the game. It was a hell of a game to be involved in. But, now our attention turns to today and respectfully, for the challenge Afghanistan present us with. So, we will make sure that the guys are keyed up for this game. We would have batted first as well, but it's not to be. So, we will go about our work with the ball in hand and hopefully, get ourselves a total that we can chase down later on. It's always a good wicket here. Obviously, a fantastic cricket wicket, there are normally a lot of runs as well, very good groundsman in Phil, he knows how to prepare a wicket which has a lot of runs about it. So, it's nothing different today. Obviously, slightly different boundaries to what we have seen in the last couple of games, got to make sure that we adapt to that. We are playing the same team as well. It's a good opportunity for us to go about our work again and try and get some points. It's really tough on the guys missing out, we look at this World Cup, not just as an isolation of World Cup itself, but also look at the preparation games we had. I guess the beauty of such a tough schedule is that we are able to get a lot of game time for our squad members. They haven't had an impact so far in the tournament on the field, but I believe we have got guys who can be called upon at any given time, will stand up and deliver for us. It's tough for them, but at the same time, the guys have performed really well, we have got some nice combinations going and it is a good problem to have when you're able to roll out the same team. We have got some experience and very good cricketers in the side.'Nabi: 'It's a lot of travelling for us. After every game, the next day we are travelling. It is hard to adjust with jet lag as well. We try our best to adjust with the conditions. We will bat first here, it is a used wicket and we will try our best to put some score on the board. It's a part of the game. We tried our best in the Australia game, but you know that Australia are one of the best teams in that conditions in Perth, they played an excellent game. It is exciting to see the whole ground packed and cheering both teams as well. We are playing the same team.'Head-to-Head: These two sides are facing each other for the first time in ODIs. We all know the expected result. But, cricket is a funny game. So, can David(Afghanistan) beat Goliath(New Zealand)? Answer coming your way in a few hours time. Do stay tuned as the toss is not far away...AfghanistanMeanwhile, Afghanistan have played some fearless cricket in the tournament. Though they have won only one game so far, Afghanistan have put up a spirited fight in almost every game. They even gave Sri Lanka a scare. However, in the last game against Australia, they were just outplayed in all departments. Warner scored a majestic 178, Smith missed out on a ton, while Maxwell bludgeoned his way to 88. A target of 418 always seemed out of reach as Johnson made sure that the Aussies didn't have to sweat much, picking up 4 wickets and rolling Afghanistan over for 142.There were a few positives for Afghanistan from that game. The pacers bowled with a lot of vigour, especially Hamid Hassan, who was the pick of the three seamers and was appreciated by Warner as well. These were the exact words from the Aussie opener, "The boys were very surprised that how quick that fellow bowls." On the batting front, Nawroz Mangal made 33 and that should give him confidence coming into this game as he was struggling in the previous games. Will they make any changes to the playing XI? We will know in a short while.New ZealandNew Zealand can't seem to put a foot wrong. Brendon McCullum is leading arguably one of the best Kiwi sides in World Cups. Their only test was against familiar foes Australia. And they somehow managed to scrape through to a 1-wicket win. It was the match of the tournament. Two captains with an attacking mindset made it even more exciting. Warner got going very quickly, but New Zealand managed to pull things back through Vettori. Then, Boult came and ripped through the middle-order, restricting Australia to 151.However, the Aussies were not giving up easily. They fought tooth and nail. Even though McCullum scored a quickfire fifty, the Kiwis were staring at a defeat. Mitchell Starc kept plugging away at one end and almost gave his side a miraculous victory. But, it was Kane Williamson's calm composure that saw the Black Caps through. Even though they have won all their games, New Zealand don't want to disturb the winning combination. Meaning, they will not be testing their bench strength in this game.08:45 Local Time, 20:45 GMT, 02:15 IST: Today's encounter can be termed as a David vs Goliath battle. A complete mismatch between the two opponents. One side, we have New Zealand, who are playing their best cricket and on the other side, we have Afghanistan - a team that has grown leaps and bounds over the last few years. Hello and welcome to our coverage of the New Zealand-Afghanistan game. Let us have a recap of what these two teams have done in the tournament so far..Preview:It's a contest between a team that is looking to maintain its dominance in Pool A and a team that's sole purpose is to stand up to Test nations and play with bravado. The way New Zealand have performed in their previous four matches - winning all of them - they look like the team to beat. Their biggest test was arch-rivals Australia who they eventually managed to dispatch in a humdinger late last month.To beat such a team is out of the question and Afghanistan should know that. All they could do is make sure they don't lose it without putting up a fight and learning a few more lessons.Date and start: March 8, 2015, 3.30 am (IST)Venue: McLean Park, NapierWeather: It's been predicted to be sunny with the temperatures hovering between 14 and 27 degrees CelsiusTeam News:New ZealandThe Black Caps have confirmed they are going in with the same team that played against Australia. Their intention is clear: they don't want to disturb the winning composition.Final XI: 1 Martin Guptill, 2 Brendon McCullum (capt), 3 Kane Williamson, 4 Ross Taylor, 5 Grant Elliott, 6 Corey Anderson, 7 Luke Ronchi (wk), 8 Daniel Vettori, 9 Adam Milne, 10 Tim Southee, 11 Trent BoultAfghanistanAfghanistan lost to Australia by 275 runs in their last match but are unlikely to make any changes. This is their best XI following Mirwais Ashraf's side strain that ruled him out of the remainder of the tournament.Probable XI: 1 Javed Ahmadi, 2 Usman Ghani, 3 Nawroz Mangal, 4 Asghar Stanikzai, 5 Samiullah Shenwari, 6 Mohammad Nabi (capt), 7 Najibullah Zadran, 8 Afsar Zazai (wk), 9 Dawlat Zadran, 10 Hamid Hassan, 11 Shapoor ZadranPlayers to watch out for:Trent Boult's five-for against Australia went a long way towards the Kiwis coming out on top. It will be interesting to see how an inexperienced Afghan batting line-up deals with the threat the fast bowler poses. For Afghanistan, former captain Nawroz Mangal is yet to score a fifty in the tournament, 33 being his highest score. Tomorrow could be the day for the Afghan batsman to turn his fortunes around. The Afghans really need somebody to score big runs.Quotes:The minnows have performed strongly at times in this tournament and you can't afford to ease off because they're not a more recognised opponent. We've still got to stick to our game plan and our brand of cricket, so nothing changes from our point of view: Tim Southee ahead of the gameThey will want to show everyone, they are in the shop window. They want to make sure we compete. It didn't happen in Australia, and we know we are in a very tough examination against New Zealand but as a group we are putting our best foot forward: Afghanistan coach Andy MolesTeams:Afghanistan (From): Javed Ahmadi, Nawroz Mangal, Usman Ghani, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai(w), Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor Zadran, Aftab Alam, Nasir Jamal, Gulbadin Naib, Shafiqullah ShafiqNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Adam Milne, Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Tom Latham, Mitchell McClenaghan, Nathan McCullum, Kyle MillsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
