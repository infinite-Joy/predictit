Short of a length delivery on the stumps, Finch looks to flick but closes the face of the bat a bit too early, luckily the ball died down immediately before Jordan could get thereFinch and Warner are at the crease. Finch is on strike. Jordan will open the attackWelcome back for the Australian reply.England suddenly lost 4 wickets for just 21 runs and were reduced to 198/5. Bresnan hung in there and hit some lusty blows to propel the score past 240 which looks competitive on this wicket. Australia took the pace off the ball after a good opening stand and got their rewards. Coulter-Nile bagged three while Faulkner and Christian bagged two each. The run chase is going to be very interesting. Join us back around 18:25 Local Time.So something for the England bowlers to work with. The pitch isn't all that easy to bat on and they should fancy their chances. It is on the slower side but they only have one spinner in the side. But for Tim Bresnan's late surge, England would have been 20 runs lesser than their actual score. 177/4 in 39.5 overs with Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara at the crease, the visitors would have backed themselves to score 90 runs in the last 10 but the latter kissed one the next ball to start a collapse.4

The last ODI at Brisbane was all about James Faulkner, who single-handedly won the game for the hosts from nowhere with a sensational innings. England, after ruling the game until the arrival of Faulkner, were dejected after their stunning loss. Can the visitors quickly freshen up today and go one step further and grab their first win over Australia on the tour? Time will tell us. Hello and a warm welcome to the third ODI at the SCG. We are not far away from the toss. Stay tuned for all the team updates...PreviewAnother game, another defeat for England. It was the same old story at the Gabba when Alastair Cook's men went down to Australia in a thrilling one-day game. However, much to their credit this time, England went down fighting against a blazing James Faulkner, who took the game away from them with some audacious batsmanship. However, come Sunday, England will have to come back strong in Sydney and keep their hopes alive in the series.Australia: Australia's sensational effort this summer has deflated England. The batsmen have been brilliant and the bowlers strong. Though they conceded 300 in Brisbane, it was understandable against a more confident ODI unit on a beautiful batting surface. The Australian unit seems well settled now. The openers are in form, the middle order well balanced and there are some terrific hitters of the cricket ball down the order, making the Aussies almost invincible. The bowling led by Mitchell Johnson remains lethal and Michael Clarke would be especially happy that Glenn Maxwell along with his batting skills also chips in with regular wickets.A win in Sydney will give Australia the ODI series and wouldn't Clarke like just that? But he can also be certain of England bouncing back hard to take some positives home from an otherwise forgetable summer Down UnderKey Players: The usual suspects. Johnson, Faulkner, Maxwell. There ares some useful all rounders in the side and that augurs well for the Australians ahead of the World Cup at home next year. Finch and Warner are in good touch as is Clarke, who is though, yet to get a big one this series.England: They would be completely deflated. After coming so close to their first victory of the Australian tour, England saw James Faulkner steal the thunder in typical fashion. He had done it a couple of times in India last year and his teammates were sure he could do it against the English at home.However, if England looked at the Brisbane game positively, they would have learned that they have it in them to run Australia close. The likes of Eoin Morgan, Ian Bell and Jos Butler are in great form but they would still need their captain to step up along with the young and talented Joe Root.The bowling does look a bit fragile but Chris Jordan's spells have shown the others in the attack that it is possible to trouble Australia's daunting batting line-up.Key Players: With a fifty and a century, Eoin Morgan is in the form of his life. So is Ian Bell, who has fought back from the depressive Test series. The bowling has revolved around Chris Jordan but the others will have to pull up their socks and learn to defend the decent scores their batsmen have been setting up for them.Quotes:We obviously go into every series wanting to win the series, and we're hoping after Friday night we can open a few more scars a bit wider and finish it off in Sydney. - Brad Haddin, Australia wicketekeeperI think if Alastair looked at it he'd be honest about it - maybe if he re-ran it again, the last part of that game, he may do things differently. - Graham Thorpe, England batting coachTeams:Australia (From): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), Nathan Coulter-Nile, James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay, Xavier Doherty, James Pattinson, Shane Watson, Daniel ChristianEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Joe Root, Gary Ballance, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Tim Bresnan, Chris Jordan, Boyd Rankin, Danny Briggs, Stuart Broad, Michael Carberry, Steven Finn, James Tredwell, Chris WoakesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
