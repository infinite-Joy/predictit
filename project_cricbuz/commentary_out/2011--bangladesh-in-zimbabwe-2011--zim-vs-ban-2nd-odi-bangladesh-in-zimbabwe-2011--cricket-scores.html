He has made a spectacular entry into international cricket by picking up his second consecutive five wicket haul in ODIs. Nasir Hossain batted brilliantly to notch up his maiden ODI fifty. Razzak and Shakib chipped in but Bangladesh will be disappointed with their score. Can Bangladesh pick up some quick wickets or will Zimbabwe bat securely? Join us in a short while for the run-chase.Nafees: We did not start well. The wicket was good to bat on but the batsmen did not play good shots. Nasir played brilliantly. Razzak and Shakib chipped in as well. It is not a bad total but it is also not a good total. Nasir has been playing very well. He is a good fielder and he is a good future of Bangladesh. We need to take quick wickets and we can fight back.4

Two slips in place.Iqbal and Kayes are at the crease. Iqbal is on strike. Mpofu will open the attackTeams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Shahriar Nafees, Mohammad Ashraful, Shakib Al Hasan(c), Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Abdur Razzak, Shafiul Islam, Rubel Hossain, Nasir HossainZimbabwe (Playing XI): Brendan Taylor(c), Vusi Sibanda, Hamilton Masakadza, Craig Ervine, Tatenda Taibu(w), Forster Mutizwa, Elton Chigumbura, Prosper Utseya, Ray Price, Chris Mpofu, Brian VitoriShakib: Nasir Hossain replaces Shuvo. Anything more than 250 will be a good total. I would have batted anyway.Taylor: We go with the same team and we want to exploit the early morning conditions. We need to keep it nice and simple. We have to use the first hour well and hopefully our two spinners will build pressure on the batsmen. 230-240 is a good score on this wicketPitch Report: The pitch has got less grass but it is solid and firm. Zimbabwe might be tempted to bat first. There is a bit of moisture on this wicket and there is a breeze blowing across the ground.Zimbabwe have won the toss and elected to fieldHello and Welcome to the 2nd ODI between Zimbabwe and Bangladesh at Harare. Zimbabwe have the upper hand after securing victory in the first ODI thanks to a fine knock from Vusi Sibanda. Rubel Hossain came close to claiming a hat-trick but Bangladesh were thoroughly outplayed. Brian Vitori was the star as he claimed 5/30 in his debut match and he will be expected to cause all the damage once again. This is Sid V and I will bring you all the action as it happens.By PradeepZimbabwe celebrated their comeback into Test cricket after 6 years in wilderness with a fine victory over Bangladesh. They were more at home in the shorter form of the game with a confident all round performance in the 1st ODI on Friday. For all the talk prior to the start of the Test series from Bangladesh, it has been Zimbabwe who have done all the running. Bangladesh will have to shed their lean patch if they are to compete against a team that is very high on confidence at the moment.Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe came back into reckoning in Test cricket with a brand new pair of fast bowlers in Brian Vitori and Kyle Jarvis. Jarvis missed out on the 1st ODI while Vitori continued to make hay while the sun shines. He ended up with figures of 5/30 on his debut, the 6th best figures for a debutant and the best by a Zimbabwean. Throw in the spin duo of Raymond Price and Prosper Utseya and Zimbabwe have a bowling attack suited to all conditions. Elton Chigumbura provides the balance required with some late order biffing and useful seam ups.Vusi Sibanda was unlucky to miss out on a well deserved ton in the 1st match but showed tremendous application and the will to be positive. He made sure that Bangladesh had no escape routes after being bundled out for a modest 184. Giving him company at the top is Brendan Taylor, perhaps the best amongst the Zimbabwe batsmen. The middle order looks well settled despite the failures of Tatenda Taibu and Craig Ervine in the first match. The Harare pitch is one for the batsmen and Zimbabwe will look to make it count.Bangladesh: Not much has gone right for Bangladesh in the tour so far. They went into the Test series as the overwhelming favorites, but ended up losing by a good margin. The batting has struggled so far in the tour with the ever reliable Tamim Iqbal unable to get them off to a good start. The middle order has wobbled under the sustained pressure exerted by Vitori and were reduced to 43/5 in the first ODI. Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim did limit the damage with a century stand but the top order needs to do a lot more if Bangladesh are to compete in the remainder of the series.Spin is Bangladesh's strength and they backed themselves up by employing 4 spinners in the first match. Rubel Hossain toiled manfully and ended with an impressive haul in which he almost brought his team right back into it. The spinners were a touch expensive and did not have too many wickets to show for the efforts. Bangladesh might well be thinking about dropping one of their spinners in favour of a pacer.Team News:Zimbabwe do not need to play around with their team and they might go in with an unchanged squad yet again which means that Kyle Jarvis will have to wait longer.Bangladesh might be tempted to play the extra seamer in Robiul Islam which means a spinner, most probably Suhrawadi Shuvo or Mahmudullah might have to sit out.Quotes:We surrendered wickets too easily but when I have taken the time to settle down with them I expect rapid improvement - Bangladesh coach Stuart Law hopes for an improved performance.We will surely keep on improving after beating Bangladesh twice this week.. But we know they will come back at us strongly - Zimbabwe skipper Brendan Taylor expects a Bangla riposte.Bangladesh (From): Nasir Hossain, Shakib Al Hasan, Abdur Razzak, Junaid Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Robiul Islam, Shafiul Islam, Shuvagoto Hom, Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim, Nazmul Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Shahriar Nafees, Suhrawadi ShuvoZimbabwe (From): Brian Vitori, Tino Mawoyo, Brendan Taylor, Elton Chigumbura, Hamilton Masakadza, Keegan Meth, Ray Price, Tatenda Taibu, Regis Chakabva, Craig Ervine, Chris Mpofu, Vusi Sibanda, Prosper Utseya, Kyle Jarvis, Forster MutizwaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
