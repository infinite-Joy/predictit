They have a very tough job on their hands and they will be looking to negotiate the Zim spinners confidently.The Zimbabwe middle order has finally come to the party. After the openers departed cheaply, Sibanda and Taibu carried on the good work as they went past their fifties and strung together a solid stand. Craig Ervine carried on the good work and he went past his fifty as well.

With the pitch already offering turn, Zimbabwe's spin trio will fancy their chances of bundling them out for a low score. Join us in a short while for the run chase.4

Kenya have been the whipping boys of this tournament and they will be looking to reverse their losing streak.by Ganesh ChandrasekaranThe last of the Group A matches does not hold much interest to both players and spectators. Zimbabwe and Kenya will be fighting for pride and nothing else. The match, in all probability, will be played in front of empty stands despite it being a Sunday and the scheduling does pose some questions. It is a pity that Eden Gardens did not get a better share of matches despite having lost out to Bangalore for the India England game, Kolkata and it's fans deserve much more. Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe has won just one match of it's five so far in this WC and that was against Canada. It is a definite low for Zimbabwe considering their impressive performances in some previous editions but they are coming out of a turmoil in the cricketing and political scenario and will look to concentrate on the positives from this tournament. Brendan Taylor is one to be watched out for. He is by far the best batsman in the Zimbabwe line up and seems very comfortable against the best of attacks. Zimbabwe will want him to deiver more on the promise he has shown so far. Kenya: Kenyan Cricket is nowhere near the previous standards it had set for itself. They reached the semis of the 2003 edition and eight years later one would have expected them to be one among the top nations but that was not to be. They have fallen steeply from those dramatic heights and have failed to register a single win in this edition. One just wonders how different it could have been if Kenya had been given more opportunities to compete against the top nations immediately after 2003 or atleast getting them to compete in the domestic tourneys of nations like Australia and India where the standards set are pretty high and could have done a world of good to the young players of that side. A few of them from that side are still around and while the likes of Odoyo and Tikolo have reached the twilight of their career, Collins Obuya has done a U turn and turned into a genuine batsman from a leg spinner. Kenya will strive to restore some pride and not go home without a single win. They will depend heavily on the experienced campaigners to deliver one last time for them. Head to Head: Zimbabwe and Kenya have faced off 31 times previously and Zim have on 24 of thos occasions. Kenya have just 5 against their name and will look to do some slight change to that record in Kolkata. Quotes:Our batting has been a disappointment. We have not given our spin attack enough chances to win us games. We've scored runs in the past, but it has just not worked out (this time): Zimbabwe coach Alan ButcherWhat is disappointing is that someone like Ricky Ponting saying that Associates don't need to be here (in the World Cup). We need to keep improving and all we need to do is to play good cricket: Kenya skipper Jimmy KamandeTeams:Zimbabwe (From): Brendan Taylor, Regis Chakabva, Tatenda Taibu(w), Charles Coventry, Graeme Cremer, Elton Chigumbura(c), Prosper Utseya, Ray Price, Tinashe Panyangara, Terry Duffin, Chris Mpofu, Sean Ervine, Gregory Lamb, Shingirai Masakadza, Vusi SibandaKenya (From): Maurice Ouma(w), Seren Waters, Rakep Patel, Collins Obuya, David Obuya, Jimmy Kamande(c), Tanmay Mishra, Nehemiah Odhiambo, Alex Obanda, James Ngoche, Elijah Otieno, Shem Ngoche, Thomas Odoyo, Peter Ongondo, Steve TikoloLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
