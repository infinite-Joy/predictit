Hope the top order learns something from that and does better. I would like to win the toss once in a while. The selectors have decided to rest Bishoo and Martin comes in. Darren Bravo is in for Kirk Edwards.India have won the toss and elected to fieldRaina: Wicket looks really dry. We are going to bowl first. Everyone is capable. The other players are putting in a lot of hardwork with the coaches. We have made three changes in the team - Tiwary, Ishant and Ashwin come in for Dhawan, Munaf and Harbhajan.Good evening or a very good morning if you are in the West Indies. The Indian side have already clinched the 5 match series and today's game is just a chance for them to give the likes of Manoj Tiwary, Ashwin and Ishant Sharma an opportunity. On the other hand, the Windies side will look to notch up a win and for that to happen, they have to play much better than what they have so far produced in the series. Do stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Kathik Lakshmanan:The absence of senior Indian players from the series might have resulted in a dip in TRP ratings but brought with it an opportunity for the West Indies to give the world champions a tough fight. But despite that, the home side finds itself down 0-3 in the 5 match series. With the series already in India's kitty, the TRP ratings will go further down but again gives West Indies a chance to prove to themselves more than anyone that they can win a few matches.India: The new look Indian team's performances so far in the series has left coach Duncan Fletcher in awe of the depth of talent in the nation and prompted him to state that India are set to dominate world cricket in the next few years. Led by Suresh Raina, the second-string Indian team has given a good account of itself dominating the struggling Caribbean side and overcoming the rare challenge posed by the home side. The young guns, particularly the likes of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and the skipper himself have been greatly benefitted by the opportunity given to them. While Rohit Sharma is striving for consistency in Indian colours, Kohli and Raina are enjoying their roles as senior players. Dhawan, Parthiv and Badrinath have looked good in patches and would be hoping to make the most of the remaining 2 matches to impress the selectors.The batting has been impressive but it's the bowlers who have set up the victories. Praveen Kumar and Munaf Patel have been as reliable as ever but it is spinner Amit Mishra who has caught everyone's attention with his wily variations. The leg spinner, who was always seen as a Test specialist, has troubled and exposed the home side's technical deficiencies with top class spin bowling.With the series already won, India will be looking to give the bench a chance in the remaining games. The likes of Tiwary, Ashwin and Ishant, who have been knocking at the doors of selection with impressive performances, are likely to get a look in.West Indies: Captain Darren Sammy has struggled to explain just why his players are finding it tough in home conditions against an opposition which is without its top stars but that has the been the sad story for the home side. They have challenged the Indians now and then but have largely been outplayed. To their credit, they have put themselves in good positions in a couple of matches but have failed to finish games. Sammy attributed it to 'lack of killer instinct' but he would be knowing that a large part of it is plainly due to lack of talent. The lack of runs from the top order and the missing bite in the bowling is hurting the home side. Simmons, Sarwan and Samuels have shown some promise but none have kicked on to make match winning contributions. What is heartening for the West Indies is the inspiring knock by Russell. A hurricane unbeaten 92 by a number nine batsman is just the kind of inspiration the host batsmen need to strike it big in the remaining two matches and make the final scoreline more respectable.West Indies were down 0-3 in their last ODI series against Pakistan and went on to win the last two games to make it a respectable 2-3. With the Indians expected to further test their bench strength, the Caribbean team has a chance to repeat that performance.Quotes:"Kemar is one of our strike bowlers and we needed a bit extra from him": WI skipper Darren Sammy."It is due to the amount of talent India have.
