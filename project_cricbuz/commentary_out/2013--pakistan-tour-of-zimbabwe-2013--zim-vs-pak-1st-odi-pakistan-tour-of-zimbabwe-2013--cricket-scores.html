Mohammad Irfan will open the attackWelcome back. The players are making their way out to the middle. Here we go for the first ball.Pakistan's innings was all about Mohammad Hafeez and Misbah-ul-Haq. The former made a fine fifty at the start to give a good platform for the rest of his batsmen. But they failed to capitalise on that and lost a flurry wickets in the middle overs. Misbah held one end tight and made a fantastic fifty after starting off slowly. In the end, Pakistan would be resonably happy with their score. They could have had more with some big hits in the death overs but the Zimbabwe bowlers bowled well. Vitori and Chatara bagged two wickets each. Now the onus on their batsmen. Join us back for the Zimbabwean reply.4
PAKISTAN:49.6  Panyangara to Misbah-ul-Haq, 2 runs, full ball outside off stump, Misbah slices the drive in the air, the fielder makes a deperate dive to catch the ball but it evades him and rolls to deep backward point

PAKISTAN:47.5 B Vitori to Sarfraz Ahmed, out Sarfraz Ahmed Run Out!! 1 run completed. The Pakistanis cannot believe the third umpire's call and rightly so. Ahmed made it with a fine dive but the man in the air-conditioned box thought otherwise. Short of length delivery on the leg stump, Ahmed flicks it to square leg and pushes Misbah-ul-Haq for the second, the throw is good and Taylor takes the bails off in a flash. The replays showed that some part of Ahmed's bat had crossed the line, but the umpire has given him the marching orders. Sarfraz Ahmed run out (Malcolm Waller/Brendan Taylor) 7(18) B Vitori to Sarfraz Ahmed, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Ahmed's run-out check has been sent upstairs. Is the bat in the air?

Two slips in place..Misbah is also the first Pakistan captain to lead his team in 50 consective ODIs. Some achievement that, also shows that Pakistan are entering a stable phase with respect to captaincy.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Nasir Jamshed, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Umar Amin, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi, Haris Sohail, Junaid Khan, Saeed Ajmal, Mohammad IrfanZimbabwe (Playing XI): Vusi Sibanda, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w/c), Sean Williams, Timycen Maruma, Malcolm Waller, Elton Chigumbura, Prosper Utseya, Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai Chatara, Brian VitoriTaylor: We would have anyway bowled first, looks like there will be a bit of help for the bowlers early on. Chatara comes in place of Shingirai Masakadza. We are looking forward to performing well. 250 should be a par score on this wicket.Misbah: We will bat first. The wicket looks pretty good and it should be good for batting, it might offer a bit of assistance for the bowlers. The T20 team is really proving themselves well and will look to continue on our good start.Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batHello and welcome to the 1st ODI between Zimbabwe and Pakistan. Zimbabwe were completely outclassed by the visitors in the 2-match T20I series and they will be looking to improve on their performance. Pakistan on the other hand will look to continue their dominance. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info....Preview:Zimbabwe know they must buck their recent trend and get all three departments of their game to fire if they are going to challenge Pakistan in the three-match one-day series. Having been whitewashed 5-0 by India in a recent series, Brendan Taylor's side showed signs of improvement during two Twenty20 matches against Pakistan last week but still lost comfortably because of their inability to play the perfect game.While the Zimbabwean batsmen successfully moved on from a horror showing against India, the Pakistani targets proved beyond them because of some lacklustre bowling and fielding -- and also the brilliance of Ahmed Shehzad, who scored 168 runs in the two games.With Pakistan promising to field a full-strength side, the hosts know they will need to get everything right if they are to win a game. "Realistically we need all three departments to function properly," Zimbabwe assistant coach Steve Mangongo said. "That has been the biggest weakness - either the batting does well and the bowling comes short, or vice versa."Hamilton Masakadza was restored to the top of the order alongside Vusi Sibanda for the two Twenty20s, and the move brought reward as they put on 50 partnerships in both games. Mangongo confirmed that the pair would continue to open the batting in the one-day internationals. "Since the India series, they have got back in form during the T20s and if they can maintain that then we can get a competitive score," he said.Although Pakistan will be strong favourites for another series sweep, captain Misbah-ul-Haq confirmed that they will not be taking Zimbabwe lightly. Asked whether the tourists might use the series to experiment with different combinations, Misbah said: "I don't think so. Any side at home could be dangerous. We would like to give a few youngsters chances but still we will like to go with the main strength and try to win, as it is important for us to win this."Having been rested for the Twenty20 matches, left-arm seamer Junaid Khan is expected to come into the side on Tuesday, while batsman Asad Shafiq and allrounder Abdur Rehman will also be in contention.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Brendan Taylor(w/c), Regis Chakabva, Tendai Chatara, Chamu Chibhabha, Elton Chigumbura, Michael Chinouya, Graeme Cremer, Timycen Maruma, Shingirai Masakadza, Tino Mawoyo, Natsai Mushangwe, Tinotenda Mutombodzi, Tinashe Panyangara, Vusi Sibanda, Sikandar Raza, Prosper Utseya, Brian Vitori, Malcolm Waller, Sean Williams, Hamilton MasakadzaPakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Anwar Ali, Asad Ali, Haris Sohail, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Nasir Jamshed, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi, Umar Amin, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Abdur Rehman, Asad ShafiqLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
