The pitch isn't all that easy to bat on. It is offering some assistance to the slower bowlers and the chase is going to be very interesting. Can South Africa ease past Australia yet again in the series? We'll find out soon...Wow! Australia have stolen 70 runs off the last five overs! All credit must go to Mitchell Marsh! Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Ryan McLaren, no one was spared. I am sure that knock will lift the spirits in the Australian dressing room!

I think it'll be a better wicket than the last game. The surface will get better as the game progresses," reckons Shaun Pollock.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Aaron Phangiso, Imran TahirAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Mitchell Marsh, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Kane RichardsonThree changes for Australia. Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson and Kane Richardson are back for them. Michael Clarke has been ruled out obviously while Ben Cutting and James Faulkner have been dropped. Two changes for SA, AB de Villiers is back, he replaces the runless Rilee Rossouw. Morne Morkel is back as well, he replaces Kyle Abbott.South Africa have won the toss and have opted to fieldWhen these two sides met a few days ago we witnessed a cracking contest. Australia set South Africa a daunting target, but the latter chased it down very easily in the end. There is no doubt that these two sides will once again fight hard to get the better of each other. The biggest blow for the Aussies is the hamstring injury to Michael Clarke. He returned to action in the previous game, but had to retire hurt on 68 before coming out again in the last over for formality. He's now flown back to Australia to get some treatment. So who's going to replace him? What's going to be the team combination of both the sides? Toss and more coming your way in a very short while. Stay tuned...Australia find themselves under a bit of pressure in the tri-series after their shocking loss to Zimbabwe a couple of days ago. With the hosts just one point behind, Australia need to win today to pull away from them so as to have a better chance of qualifying to the final. Meanwhile, South Africa are sitting pretty at the top of table having won both their games. AB de Villiers would hope that his boys would keep the momentum going and ensure a victory today.PreviewAustralia will be smarting after an embarrassing loss to hosts Zimbabwe just a day ago. The win for Zimbabwe, however, does open up the tournament nicely. South Africa are sitting pretty with two wins from two games. But only a point separates Australia and Zimbabwe now. Both teams have won a game each with one more to go. Australia are just ahead by virtue of bagging a bonus point. A loss against South Africa will put their position in jeopardy but even a win will not guarantee them a place in the final until the result of the last league game between Zimbabwe and South Africa is known.Australia:In what is seen as one of their worst defeats, Australia will be pumped up to bounce back strongly. South Africa cannot afford to take them lightly as they come in the way of what should be a strong riposte from the Australians. If the loss was not embarrassing enough, they men from Down Under were jolted by the injury to Michael Clarke that has forced him to return home. The loss also saw them losing the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings. Clarke was not happy with the selections for the previous game and it will be interesting to see what combination takes the field in his absence. Playing spin has been an obvious weakness and Imran Tahir would be licking his lips in anticipation to try and add salt to the wounds. Clarke's injury also means that Australia have now lost their best player of spin.The bowling department was overshadowed after the abject surrender by the batsmen. However, George Bailey - the stand-in captain - will have little worries on this front. Mitchell Johnson should return and will add more potency to the attack that has already seen some noteworthy performances from Nathan Lyon and Mitchell Starc. However, all of them came under fire from AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis last time around. That will be on their back of minds and will only add in motivating the players to turn in an improved show.South Africa:The Proteas have played like a team in form. Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Quinton de Kock, du Plessis and JP Duminy have all been in very good form in recent times. The batting-line up looks as imposing as any in the world currently. With Imran Tahir's inclusion, the bowling too has some variety to it alebit his inconsistent performances.AB de Villiers will want his men to play on the weaknesses that Australia have shown. They would want to ensure that the pressure on Australia does not slacken even a touch. South Africa are more or less through to the final but a win against Australia will seal a spot for them leaving no room for outside chances.Quotes:We've got problems, so we've got to sort them out. We've got to learn really quickly because teams are going to see that and they're going to react to it - Darren Lehmann, Australia coach.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Wayne Parnell, Ryan McLaren, Dale Steyn, Aaron Phangiso, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Rilee Rossouw, Kyle Abbott, Mthokozisi SheziAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Mitchell Marsh, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Kane Richardson, Ben CuttingLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
