This is what Steyn wanted to do in his previous over. He was aware that Waller wasn't comfortable against his pace, he attempted a bumper then but got the radar wrong. Now he fires it at the body of the batsman forcing him to do a mistake. End of a fine promising 46-run stand. M Waller c Rossouw b Steyn 20(23) [4s-3]Steyn to M Waller, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ZIMBABWE:24.5 Steyn to M Waller, FOUR, meanwhile, Waller has played a top shot! A Sachin Tendulkaresque upper cut from him! Watches the short ball closely onto the bat, the fact that Steyn offered width outside off stump made life easy for Waller, who used his wrists nicely to send it very fine over what would have been a slip cordon in Test matches. Third man runs around but couldn't get there in time. Maybe after seeing Waller struggle against his pace, Steyn wanted to attack him with a bouncer

ZIMBABWE:21.2 Kyle Abbott to M Waller, FOUR, edged but safe!

Steyn will open the attackWelcome back.. The Zimbabwean openers are out. Steyn has the new ball in his hand. He has two slips to assist him..There is something in the wicket for the spinners. Can the South African spinners extract the same kind of turn? Can Zimbabwe hold their nerve and chase this down? It is going to be an interesting run-chase. Join us back in a few minutes to find out more....Zimbabwe will be very pleased with their effort on the field. Utseya was the hero with the ball. He picked up a hat-trick and also his first 5-wicket haul. He also became the second Zimbabwean to take a hat-trick in ODIs. This is South Africa's lowest total in Zimbabwe. At one stage, when they were 142/0, it looked like they will get to 300 with ease. However, Amla departed after scoring a fifty and so did QdK. After those two wickets, things went downhill as none of the batsmen could pick the variations of Utseya and Nyumbu. The spin-duo picked up 8 wickets between them and were well supported by Williams and Chatara.4

We had some good success in the last few games. We have been playing good cricket and we are happy about it. It has definitely given us confidence (when asked about the chase against Australia). Faf and AB did it for us. AB, batting throughout the end, was exceptional. We have no set target in mind today. We will just take it as it comes."Chigumbura: "We will bowl first. We think it is a good wicket to chase down and hopefully we will be able to restrict them to a chaseable total. There is a lot going on in the team but at the end of the day we just need to focus on our game. 2 changes - Vitori and Waller come in for Panyangara and Mutumbami."Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: "Today's pitch is dry and some cracks have developed. There is no moisture in it. It will be a slow wicket and we will get some turn as well. Team winning the toss will be looking to bat first," reckons Shaun Pollock.Hello and welcome to the 3rd ODI of the Triangular series. Toss and teams coming your way in a few minutes. Stay tuned...Zimbabwe, meanwhile, are a troubled bunch. They possess the zeal to fight but tend to crumble under pressure. Their bowling attack may be inexperienced but has managed to perform decently against stronger teams. Now, with the axing of Tinashe Panyangara, they will be forced to make a change in their line-up. Their biggest weakness has been the form of their batsmen, who usually give up without putting up much of a fight. Can they change that today? Or will they meekly surrender yet again?For South Africa, it seems like nothing can go wrong. They have been brilliant in all formats of the game in recent times having defeated top teams. Just a few days back, they thrashed Zimbabwe 3-0 in the bilateral series. A sound batting line-up and a feared bowling unit, combined with exceptional fielding skills make them the team to beat. They successfully chased even a total of 327 against Australia on Wednesday. If they guard themselves against complacency setting in, they will be just fine.Preview by MS RamakrishnanA thrashing defeat at the hands of Australia a few days ago has put Zimbabwe in a spot of bother. The hosts need pull up their socks come Friday, to keep their hopes alive in the tri-series. However, life is certainly not going to be easy for them as they are up against South Africa, against whom they lost the bilateral series 3-0 at home recently.Zimbabwe:The hosts haven't had a great time of late. The fact that they have lost their last 7 ODIs explains the story of a side that is struggling to compete at the highest level. Spending quality time in the middle is the biggest problem for Zimbabwe's batsmen. Against top international bowling attacks they have meekly surrendered their wickets, with the odd exception proving their struggle. Hamilton Masakadza is one such batsman - he has scored three fifties in the last five ODIs, while Sean Williams has been consistent in the middle-order. Brendan Taylor's dip in form is hurting Zimbabwe badly as he is not only their best batsmen, but also the only player in the top-order to have played more than 150 ODIs. In fact, Taylor has managed to score only two fifties in his last 21 ODIs.The bowling department too is relatively inexperienced and it's hard to expect them to restrict sides like South Africa and Australia to under 280-300 on a regular basis. Sean Williams' left-arm spin has been effective, while rookie John Nyumbu has impressed in his first few games. However, Zimbabwe, as a unit, will have to be at their best as they will be up against the likes of Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers and JP Duminy. On the whole, at least to justify their status as a full member of the ICC, it is high time that Zimbabwe get results going their way.South Africa:Unlike their opposition, the Proteas have been top notch for a while now in all forms of cricket. Series wins in both Tests and ODIs against Sri Lanka in their own backyard have lifted the spirits in the side, which then went onto win the bilateral series against hosts Zimbabwe despite resting a few of their main players. The top-order has a done a great job and each of the top four batsmen - Amla, de Kock, du Plessis and de Villiers - have scored at least one hundred in their last five ODIs. The fact that South Africa have scored in excess of 300 four times in the last seven ODIs explains that the batsmen are in great nick.You won't complain much if you have the likes of Dale Steyn, Ryan McLaren and Morne Morkel in your bowling line-up. In fact the trio is ranked among the top 10 in the ODI rankings for bowlers. The second match of the ongoing tri-series - against Australia - is the only occasion when the South African bowlers have leaked more than 300 in 17 ODIs. It speaks volumes of the quality of attack they have. There is no doubt that Zimbabwe will have to be on top of their game even to post a competitive total on the board.Team News:Zimbabwe will be forced to make a change with the axing Tinashe Panyangara. The fast bowler was removed from the squad for sharing a video of Mitchell Johnson bowling bouncers during the 2013-14 Ashes series with his teammates as Zimbabwe's disciplinary committee felt that Panyangara's actions were disruptive in the build-up to the tri-series. So this means that one of Luke Jongwe, Shingi Masakadza, Neville Madziva, Cuthburt Musoko or Brian Vitori, will get a look in.The form of Wayne Parnell is the biggest concern for South Africa as he has been quite expensive in his recent outings. Though the Proteas would not want to disturb a winning combination it won't be a surprise to see Parnell being left out for Kyle Abbott, who performed reasonably well against Zimbabwe in the recently concluded ODI series.Stats:- Zimbabwe have not beaten South Africa in the last 14 years. Their last victory came on February 2, 2000 at Durban.- Ryan McLaren is the leading wicket-taker for South Africa in ODIs this year with 16 wickets.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Wayne Parnell, Ryan McLaren, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Aaron Phangiso, Mthokozisi Shezi, Kyle Abbott, Rilee RossouwZimbabwe (From): Sikandar Raza, Tino Mawoyo, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura(c), Richmond Mutumbami(w), Prosper Utseya, Luke Jongwe, Shingirai Masakadza, Neville Madziva, Tendai Chatara, Curthbert Musoko, Brian Vitori, John Nyumbu, Malcolm Waller, Vusi Sibanda, Timycen Maruma, Natsai MushangweLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
