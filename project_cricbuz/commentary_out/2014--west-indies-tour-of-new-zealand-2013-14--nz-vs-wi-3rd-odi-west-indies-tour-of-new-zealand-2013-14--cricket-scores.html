The wicket has good pace and bounce. Short square as well. We know we need to win this game. We are very thankful we get to play this game that looked very unlikely. West Indies are a very good team in the short version. Adam Milne and Jimmy Neesham come inDwayne Bravo: 'I think its going be start-stop game. The wicket was covered for most part of the day. We fancy our bowlers to do the job. We have to field and chase whatever total they set. Sammy is out unfortunately with hamstring injury. Darren Bravo is also back home, so two key players are missing. Nikita Miller gets a look in'West Indies have won the toss and have opted to field15:55 Local Time, 02:55 GMT, 08:25 IST: Alright folks, the umpires give the green signal for a 21-over game.15:45 Local Time, 02:45 GMT, 08:15 IST: After a long deliberation, the umpires sense the possibility of sqeeezing in a 20-over clash, especially with the overhead conditions showing drastic improvement, a far cry from the bleak pictures in the morning. Following the dry-up operations, the umpires will be back again for another inspection.15:37 Local Time, 02:37 GMT, 08:07 IST: The groundsmen are drying the outfield. The covers are still on despite conditions improving a trifle. There is no official confirmation about any resumption though.15:10 Local Time, 02:10 GMT, 07:10 IST: Just when the diligent groundstaff were on the move to withdraw the side covers, the rain had picked up. The umpires are in the middle of a serious discussion with the groundsmen. Brendon McCullum also joins the conversation. There may be a slender chance of a 20-overs per-side shoot-out if the persistent rain stops.14:12 Local Time, 01:12 GMT, 06:42 IST: BLACKCAPS tweeted: 'Not much more I can say at this stage unfortunately - still drizzling. Hope starting to fade a little... #NZvWI ^CE'Ian Smith shared that the main stand had been evacuated becuase of a fire alarm just a few minutes ago. Right then, all we can do is wait, wait and wait for the rain gods to show some mercy.13:30 Local Time, 00:30 GMT, 05:30 IST: The rain is as steady as it has been. It is mighty misty as well. Not the ideal conditions for a game of cricket. The crowd hang on optimistically in anticipation of a late start.13:15 Local Time, 00:15 GMT, 05:45 IST: All dull and dreary at Queenstown. Not even tiny signs of improvement in weather.12:45 Local Time, 23:45 GMT, 05:15 IST: The steady drizzle continues unabated. Meanwhile BLACKCAPS have tweeted: 'If your New Year's resolution was to be more patient, then you're getting a good test today - light drizzle still, stop soon hopefully! ^CE'12:25 Local Time, 23:25 GMT, 04:55 IST: Ian Bishop has just tweeted the following: 'still raining lightly'. So, brace yourselves for what appears to be a long day.12:20 Local Time, 23:20 GMT, 04:50 IST: No updates from the ground yet. It may be recalled that rain ruined the previous two ODI's at this venue.11:40 Local Time, 22:40 GMT, 04:10 IST: The covers are still on. Dark clouds prevail. Ian Smith is hopeful that the rain may subside in about 40 minutes.10:58 Local Time, 21:58 GMT, 03:28 IST: The toss was slated to happen at 09:30 Local Time but it's still raining at Queenstown. To make matters worse, the forecast appears gloomy for the remainder of the dayBad news if you are a West Indies fan - Sammy may have done his hamstring during training. This is what Ian Bishop had to say, " Sammy bowls tidy overs, he is a power-hitter, no Gayle as well. He is criticial lower down the order. It's a tough one. You dont know if you want to go for a extra bowler in Best or Miller or you want to go for an extra batsman in Walton. One of the poor things about inclement weather, you want to play as many games as possible, heading to the World Cup. It's disappointing. The surface looks hard. Plenty of grass on it. Holder's tall and bowls full, Rampaul bowls full as well."Mark Richardson: "Yeah it's misty, not great prospects. Let us hope it clears away. The outfield here is better than the Naiper one. Once the rain stops, hopefully the game gets underway."10:30 Local Time, 21:30 GMT, 03:00 IST: With steady rains drenching Queenstown, the toss, in all likelihood, will be delayed. Live pictures show the entire square being covered. As Ian Smith says on air, we are all in a holding pattern. Argh! A damp start to the 2014. About half an hour ago, whilst the teams were warming up, the heavens opened up. The rain gods have not relented yet.Unfortunately, a big rain threat looms large over this game too. Toss, teams and weather updates to follow shortly. Do stay tuned folks.Firstly, wishing you all a very happy and prosperous New Year.
