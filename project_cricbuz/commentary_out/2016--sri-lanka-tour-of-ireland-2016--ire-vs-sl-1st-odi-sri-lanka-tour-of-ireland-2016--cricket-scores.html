The captain is out to face the music first upSri Lanka would be well pleased with this effort to get up to 303, courtesy a 19-ball 42 from Dasun Shanaka and a solid century from Dinesh Chandimal. After being put into bat on a cold morning with a hint of rain around, the batsmen managed to keep the pressure on the bowlers right from the start. Kusal Perera took the team off to a flier and after he fell, Kusal Mendis and Chandimal took over the mantle and put up a busy 82-run partnership. The bowlers did try their best, but with the ball getting wet, thanks to the constant drizzle, found it hard to grip the ball and ended up spraying it around towards the middle overs. However, they did quite well in the final few overs to pull things back just when the Lankans looked like running away with the game. Do join us shortly for the Irish reply.4
