There's a slip in place for Rampaul.In fact, they were 109/7 at one stage when Holder got out. However, Samuels kept playing his shots, making sure that the visitors get some quick runs in the last few overs. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will be disappointed after the position they were in earlier. Their bowlers were very inconsistent towards the end overs. Well, now it is upto their batsmen to go out and chase this down. Remember, the target for Sri Lanka has been adjusted to 190 after D/L calculations. Stay tuned for the run-chase.The visitors are lucky to have gone past 200. All thanks to one man - Marlon Samuels. He was under some pressure after he failed in the Tests, but he has shown his class once again, hitting a century after a fifty in the previous game. The West Indies got off to a very poor start as they lost half their side for just 52 runs on the board, but Samuels along with the lower order, made sure that they get a decent total in the end.3

Malinga will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Malinga will start the proceedings. There are two slips in place.Holder: 'Looks a pretty good wicket, probably wouldn't change much. We wanted to bowl first as well. Denesh Ramdin comes back and Jason Mohammed misses out. We did well in the first game, but we weren't upto the mark in the last game. Hopefully, we can change that today.'Mathews: 'We will have a bowl first. Definitely, we have the weather in mind. There's a lot more dew in the latter stages and that's why we want to chase. We have made one change, Chameera comes in place for Senanayake. It's not going to spin as much as Colombo.'Pitch Report: 'It is usually a bat first wicket. The faster bowlers have had more success here. There should be showers later. It's a dark pitch, it's a dry one. I think the ball will come onto the bat nicely. The new ball has to count, otherwise the team will struggle to take wickets. The captain that wins the toss should field first and try to chase the total down', reckons Russel ArnoldSri Lanka have made one change, Chameera replaces Senanayake. For the West Indies, Taylor and Mohammed make way for Holder and Ramdin. It's a surprise that Russell isn't in the team. May be, the visitors don't want to risk him in a dead rubber, with the T20I series starting soon.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Johnson Charles, Andre Fletcher, Darren Bravo, Jermaine Blackwood, Marlon Samuels, Jonathan Carter, Denesh Ramdin(w), Jason Holder(c), Carlos Brathwaite, Sunil Narine, Ravi RampaulSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kusal Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Milinda Siriwardana, Shehan Jayasuriya, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Suranga Lakmal, Dushmantha ChameeraSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldAfter a thrilling finish in the first ODI, the West Indies were completely outplayed in the second match, with Kusal Perera and Lahiru Thirimanne starring for the visitors. Even though Perera missed out on a ton by just one run, Thirimanne made sure that he takes his team over the line with a fluent 81. For the West Indies, Johnson Charles batted really well in the last game. Marlon Samuels too found some form for the visitors with a 63 in the previous ODI and will be hoping to continue from where he left off. The toss and the teams are not far away. Stay tuned.Jason Holder, who was given a one match suspension, didn't play the last game and Marlon Samuels captained the side in his absence. Holder will return to the side today.

The home team has already taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, but the men from the Caribbean will be looking to finish the series on a high.
