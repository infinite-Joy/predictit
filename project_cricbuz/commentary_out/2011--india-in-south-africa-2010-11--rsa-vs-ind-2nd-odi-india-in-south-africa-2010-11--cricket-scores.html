Zaheer will open the attackWelcome back for the chase. Two slips as Zaheer steams in. Can India pick up early wickets? We will see.Another insipid display from the Indian batsmen. Murali Vijay started off well with a couple of sweetly timed boundaries, but once he fell, the scoring rate dipped. Wickets fell at regular intervals with the Proteas giving nothing away in the field. Dhoni and Yuvraj put on a stand, which threatened for a while until Tsotsobe came back to send back the latter. Tsotsobe was brilliant all through - bowling a consistent line and length, getting disconcerting lift and in the process registering his career best figures. The batting power-play backfired spectacularly for India and a score of 240 which at one stage looked likely suddenly proved to be an insurmountable hurdle. One after the other fell and the innings folded up for 190. The batting power-play read: 14 runs for 4 crucial wickets. It is a crime in an ODI not to bat out the overs. It should be an easy chase when the Proteas come out. We will be back at 10:10 IST for that.4

INDIA:46.3  Morne Morkel to Rohit Sharma, out Lbw!! Wow! Was Rohit Sharma struck outside the off stump? It looked so to the naked eye.

INDIA:45.4  Steyn to Zaheer, out Caught by Tsotsobe!! Bye Bye Zaheer Khan says Arun Lal on air, as another one bites the dust. Zaheer was trying to bend down and swing across the line, only managed to get a top edge, the ball goes towards third man, fabulous work from Tsotsobe to come charging to his left and then put in an effective slide, skids along on his knees as he pouches it safely.

Raina goes as Tsotsobe strikes. Raina lbw b Tsotsobe 11(14) [4s-1] Tsotsobe to Raina, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Lonwabo Tsotsobe [8.0-1-19-2] is back into the attackIndia take the batting powerplay.

Vijay is on strike. Steyn will open the attackRight, the players are walking out to the middle. The Indian openers are strolling out to have a knock. India need a good start, will they be able to provide that. We will know soon. The Proteas' seamers will be looking to exploit the early moisture that will be available. This will be Srivathsa, who will be bringing you the first 10 overs of this game.Harbhajan: SA played superbly at Durban, we have shown in the past that we can bounce back. We have got the team, and we have the talent to make a comeback. We don't have the 5th bowler who can bowl 130+ and bat as well as you did for SA (referring to Shaun Pollock). Why don't you change your colours and play for India today? I would tell the part time spinners not to bowl short, anything short will be dispatched on this wicket.JP Duminy: It was a great performance by me and AB in the first match and I enjoyed it. I would like to be in the top four but I am enjoying my role as a finisher. We want to make sure that we put a good performance today and not be complacent. I would like to try my bowling on a regular basis, but it all depends upon the opportunity. Duncan Fletcher is helping us in our WC preparations and he is playing a big part.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Colin Ingram, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Johan Botha, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo TsotsobeIndia (Playing XI): Murali Vijay, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Munaf PatelSurprise surprise, Dhoni has called it right. India opt to batSmith: The wicket here hasn't changed much over the years, we would have thought of chasing as well. We played well as a unit in Durban and there is a lot of things that we would like to reproduce here today. We go in with the same team.Dhoni: We want to bat first, put runs on the board and take the pressure off the batsmen. There may be something for the fast bowlers initially. We can't chase the series being two games behind, so this is a very important game. 270 will be a very good score, depends on the start that we get. We go unchanged.Pitch report: There has been a lot of rain over the last couple of days. The groundsman has prepared a sporting wicket despite the rain. The average score batting first here for the last 8 games is 193 which also includes a 300+ score. The bowlers will get some swing at this altitude (6000ft above sea level). The grass is dry, the spinners won't get much purchase. The team which bats second will have an added advantage feels Shaun Pollock.AB de Villiers: We were clinical at Durban, we batted well, fielded well and bowled well. We need to back up one good performance with another, that's what we would look to do today. We like to have a lot of energy on the field, we have a lot of young players, that's how we play and it will be the same today. We have a couple of fringe players at the top of the order, Ingram is a young bloke, he will play his shots. JP came in at a vital stage and we had a good partnership which set the game up for the bowlers.'We will try to field the best possible playing eleven here at the Wanderers' says MS Dhoni.5:00 PM IST: Well, it's time to welcome you all for the live coverage of the 2nd ODI between these two big teams, South Africa and India. The Wanderers at Johannesburg is all set for the match; there is a cloud of doubt over how the weather would be today. It is partly cloudy and there are chances of rain later on. Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that we will get a full game. This is Ajith and I will take you through the day along with Srivathsa, Sid V and Karthik. Kiran will be on scoring duties. Will the Indians bounce back? Don't go away, we'll be back with more...Preview:After the thrashing in the first ODI, India will need to sort out their batting and bowling and come up with a far more inspired performance than they did at Durban. It was particularly galling for the Indians to be at the receiving end of a 135-run drubbing at the venue in which they had seen a magnificent resurgence in the Test series.
After that win, which led to a drawn series and the subsequent victory in the one-off T20 International, the Indians would not have expected the start they got in the ODI series.
Nothing went right for Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men with both the batting and the bowling leaving much to be desired, after injuries had already rendered a few key men - Sehwag, Gambhir, Praveen Kumar, Sreesanth - unfit.
Batting has been India's strength but the top order collapsed like a pack of cards to be reduced to 43 for four in the first match, and the team could never really recover from that jolt. The main scoring responsibility will once again rest on Sachin Tendulkar. He has been in a rich vein of form, and is the best equipped amongst the Indians to take the formidable South African bowling attack head-on. Of the other batsmen, Virat Kohli further boosted his growing credentials with a fighting half-century, but the likes of Murali Vijay and Rohit Sharma have to pull out something special if they want to remain in the scheme of things for the World Cup. Both have received a few chances, and not made use of them. As for Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh, both need to rediscover their fluent ways, since when batting well they are unstoppable.
The Indians could push Kohli or Sharma up the order to open the innings instead of Murali Vijay, thus paving the way for Yusuf Pathan to be included in the playing XI. Alternately, if Vijay is retained, Pathan could replace Sharma.
Unlike the Indians, the South Africans put up a clinical show, but they will also have a few areas to work on. The batting looked good to reach a total well in excess of 300, but fell short in the final overs, with the lack of depth in the tail being the main reason for that. This means South Africa are very top heavy while batting, and puts the run-scoring responsibility squarely on the shoulders of the top 5 - Smith, Amla, Ingram, AB de Villiers and JP Duminy.
They responded very well in the first ODI, but it remains to be seen if they can consistently do the job for their team in the whole series.
South Africa will miss the prolific Jacques Kallis, who is nursing an injury. The veteran has been a key player in the South African batting line-up and has been more than handy with the ball as well.
South Africa's bowling was top-notch in the first ODI though, with no room for complaint and each bowler acquitting himself well. The only sore point was Johan Botha going for plenty of runs, while everyone else had kept things tight. Given that Botha is the first-choice spinner and vice-captain, and that the World Cup will be played on tracks where at least one spinner will be a must, Botha getting back his rhythm will be South Africa's top-most priority.
South Africa will be the more confident team going into the second ODI, but the Indians will not be feeling too low, knowing that they are capable of a much better performance.
Captain Speak:
"I expect them to bounce back. We have to put our foot down in the next match," Graeme Smith is not underestimating the Indian team.
"Honestly speaking, these are the four-five fast bowlers we have got. We do not have many options to play with. So we have to back them to do well. Whether they are in match practice or not what is important is that we take care of these bowlers and they should go in the World Cup without any injuries," MS Dhoni hints that the bowling combination will not be changed in spite of Ashish Nehra's horror game in the first ODI.
