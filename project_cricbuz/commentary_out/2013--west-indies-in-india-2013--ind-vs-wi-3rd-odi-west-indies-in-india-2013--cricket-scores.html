Result: Match drawn. Perhaps his finest Test hundred (though the Perth one in 1992 will still take some beating) and certainly one amongst his very best. This match was all about Steyn vs Tendulkar the battle of the ages on the third day. In two spells which spanned 11 overs of out-worldly pace and outswing bowling, to which no-one else had an answer, Tendulkar stood out like a shining star. He faced 48 of the 66 balls and managed to defend them with his supreme technique standing out, albeit luckily on a few occasions. Steyn looked like taking a wicket off each ball and the contest between him and Tendulkar was one which will be remembered for ages and ages to come. Tendulkar brought all his experience into play and shielded the others from Steyn and saw off those two spells without any damage. Once the godly Steyn was seen off, Tendulkar picked his runs and with the tail for company got his 51st Test ton. Tendulkar was beaten innumerable times by Steyn during the course of his knock, but through the sheer strength of character survived that testing period and came

Result: South Africa won by an innings and 25 runs. As has been the case so often in the past, India have been awful starters away in the opening game of a series. Having been shot out for 136 in the first innings and trailing 484, it needed a monumental effort to save the game and only one man Sachin Tendulkar stood up to the task, though it must be said that Gambhir and Dhoni too played their parts well in averting a defeat. It was a landmark hundred for Sachin his 50th one in Tests and he reached there with a firm push through the covers off Steyn. Sachin found an able ally in Dhoni who batted aggressively and both of them chipped away at the deficit. Sachin was calmness personified and got there amidst some uncertainty in the nineties. Though it was a landmark moment for Sachin, it left a sour taste in his mouth as his side crashed to an innings defeat.

When Sri Lanka and India play, it was always going to be a batathon with bowlers merely proving to be cannon fodder. This Test was no different. Sri Lanka made 642 and India replied with 707 with Tendulkar scoring his fourth double-century. The remarkable aspect of this effort was that Tendulkar was on the field in one capacity or the other for almost the entire duration of the game. He fielded for more than 5 sessions and then batted for 516 minutes. He eliminated risks and knew that there were runs for the taking on a flat wicket. By the time he finished, he had ensured that the match would have only one result a dull draw and it so proved to be.

Result: India won by an innings and 57 runs. This was a huge game for India. They needed to win to keep their No. 1 ranking intact and nothing less than a win would've done. The win almost didn't materialise due to one man's super human efforts Hashim Amla made hundreds in both innings and remained unbeaten in the 2nd, but he couldn't prevent India winning with just minutes remaining for the game to end. India's batting was woeful at Nagpur but they made up for it here with 4 hundreds in a total of 643 for 6 declared. Tendulkar's hundred was all about playing second fiddle to the brilliance of Virender Sehwag. Though Tendulkar was willing to play second fiddle, he didn't give a chance and continued his astounding run of form this hundred was his fourth in as many matches and his 92nd international ton. While Sehwag was all brute force, Tendulkar played the percentages well playing all his trademark cute shots to get himself another 100. While four Indians got hundreds and the home side won the game, all the credit almost went to Hashim Amla who was undismissable in the series.

Here we go with the first ball.....Samuels: "Last series I scored a hundred against Pakistan. I wanted to score one in this series as well. Nevertheless we have a good score. The people who get half-centuries need to turn it to 100s. You never know what to expect with the wicket. It was definitely doing a bit. It is playing better now but there is something for us. We will see how the new ball will go upfront. I expect Sunil (Narine) to play a big part today. There is a bit of moisture around."12:30 IST: West Indies will be pleased with their final score. They started well, thanks to a century partnership between Powell and Samuels. Both batsmen got starts, passed fifty but failed to convert it into bigger knocks. The spinners, Ashwin and Jadeja brought India back into the game in the middle overs and at 196/5, the visitors looked like they had frittered away a strong start.

Result: South Africa won by an innings and 6 runs. Rarely has an Indian side been outplayed so comprehensively at home like they were at Nagpur in 2010. It was the Dale Steyn show, he ripped India apart with a seven-for in the first innings. India were forced to follow-on and Tendulkar notched up his third hundred in as many matches. Walking in at 2/24, still needing 301 to make South Africa to bat again, Tendulkar handled Steyn and Co. even as the Proteas kept chipping away at the other end. Tendulkar's innings was a balance between attack and defence and he opted to kick away deliveries bowled outside leg stump by Paul Harris. When he wanted to score, he opted to play the right stroke and when he was dismissed for exactly 100, the result was just a foregone conclusion. Soon South Africa were celebrating a huge win.

Result: India won by 10 wickets. Tendulkar repeated his feat of scoring back-to-back hundreds against Bangladesh by getting one in the 2nd Test at Dhaka. He had achieved a similar feat in 2007 when India toured the country and repeated the dose in 2010. As he had done so often in the past, he took his time to change gears. His first 50-runs took 89 balls while the next took just 45 balls. Bangladesh didn't help themselves dropping Tendulkar twice and that was the last gift that the great man needed. Once he had earned reprieves, he ensured he got his customary ton, though he would've wished for a far bigger score than the 143 that he got. Tendulkar also became the first man to get to 90 international hundreds after he got to the three figure mark. This telling statistic underscores Tendulkar's dominance over Bangladesh: Tendulkar has scored a hundred every time he has gone past 50 against Bangladesh. Thus, he has five hundreds and no half-centuries in seven Tests against Bangladesh.

Result: India won by 113 runs..The talking point before the match began was the comment that Sehwag made about Bangladesh being an ordinary side. That comment came back to bite India after the opening day when they were reduced to 213/8 with Tendulkar saving the visitors the blushes. On day 2, Tendulkar completed his 44th Test ton a very important one in the context of the game as Bangladesh sensed an opening. He knew that his wicket was a crucial one and never indulged in any fancy strokeplay instead concentrating on treating each ball on its merit. The Bangladeshis probed away but couldn't prise out the champion. On the way to his 44th Test hundred, he crossed 13,000 Test runs and by the end of the innings, he had reached 13,075.

Result: India won by 6 wickets. . This was a very significant Test it came just two weeks after the Mumbai terror attacks and ended with Sachin Tendulkar making a fourth innings hundred which helped India chase down 387. Sachin later dedicated his hundred to all those who had laid down their lives during the terror attacks. It was a poignant moment and the hundred just added a touch of romanticism to the occasion. The chase was set up by the belligerence of Sehwag who catablasted 83 off 68 balls which shell-shocked the English. From then on, Tendulkar took over, shepherding the chase expertly and on a wearing pitch mastering the spinners. Fittingly it was Tendulkar who hit the winning runs, a trademark paddle swept boundary off Swann. Tendulkar rated his hundred as one of the best and scoring a hundred in a successful fourth-innings run-chase was, something he had wanted, the one achievement missing from his CV. After the match England's players donated half their match fees to the relief fund for victims of the Mumbai attack, and the Indian board donated three crore rupees (about 450,000) .We will continue posting the remaining of Sachin's hundreds.

Here we go with the first ball....Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Mohammed ShamiWest Indies (Playing XI): Kieran Powell, Johnson Charles(w), Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo(c), Darren Sammy, Jason Holder, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Veerasammy PermaulBravo: "Yes, we would have liked to bowl as well. We will look to bat well and give our bowlers something to bowl at. It will be good to win the series as we will beat a team above us but we will take it step by step. We are going in with the same side."Dhoni: "We are looking to bowl first. It is an early morning start and there will be a bit of help for the seamers. It really helps when the game starts at 9:00 AM. It has been a good series, lot of positives from the last game as well. We have to adjust with the sun which is hitting directly. We are playing the same team as the last match"India have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: "It was very damp but the colour of the pitch is changing as the sun rays fall directly on it. The toss will be more important for West Indies than India. It will be a two paced wicket and West Indies will like to restrict them and chase it down. The toss will not matter a lot as it will remain flat throughout. There will be no bounce and won't raise above waist high", reckons Ravi ShastriIndian bowlers will again look up to their spinners to do major damage. Ashwin was at his best in the last match and would like to continue in the same way as a big series against South Africa beckons. It has been a long time since an International game was played at Kanpur. It will be interesting to see how the pitch plays and what the captains decide if they win the toss. Stay tuned for the pitch report, toss and teams.....Welcome to the decider being played at Kanpur. The series is level at one each. India would like to win and keep the record of not having lost a series this year intact. Their middle order will have to come good. Yuvraj and Raina again failed with the bat in the last match. However, both have been selected for the South African series, so that should induce some confidence in their batting. West Indies will be looking to pull off a series a victory after having a poor Test series. The batsmen were good in the last match as four of them got fifties. Their bowling was led by Rampaul who has some kind of liking to the Indian team.The Preview, by Nikhil NarainA buoyant West Indies team would look to create history when they lock horns with India in the third and final ODI in Kanpur on Wednesday. The Green Park in the central city of Uttar Pradesh has been witnessed to many an epic battle and would provide an opportunity for the visitors to seal their first bilateral ODI series win for more than a decade on Indian soil. India on the other hand would like to believe that Visakhapatam was an aberration and continue their domination in the shorter formats. Reputation would be at stake for MS Dhoni's men as India, the current World Champions are atop the ICC ODI rankings while West Indies are placed at a lowly seventh position. A loss for the home side would not affect the positions for either teams but would certainly be a heavy dent on India's ego and pride. IndiaIndia will once again rely on the flamboyant duo of Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan to provide them with a rollicking start. Sharma has amassed 1155 ODI runs in 2013 and sits only behind Virat Kohli. Dhawan is not too far behind and is at the sixth position as far as aggregate runs are concerned. Virat Kohli has missed the opportunity to add to his illustrious hundreds tally with scores off 86 and 99 at Kochi and Visakhapatnam respectively and would be looking to make the West Indies pay. MS Dhoni registered a splendid fifty in Vizag, once again giving proof to the widely accepted fact that he is one of the greatest finishers in the history of ODI cricket. The only concern for India would be the form of Yuvraj Singh. The southpaw looks a flash of the player he was and struggled against the West Indian pace and spin in the second ODI. There might be a case for him to be replaced by Ambati Rayudu but with skipper Dhoni coming out in support of Yuvraj, it looks unlikely there would be any change in the top six. Ravindra Jadeja's batting form is also a cause of worry for the hosts. The fast bowling unit will continue to give nightmares to the Indian skipper. The trio of Mohammad Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohit Sharma, all took a pasting in Vizag and need to recuperate from the hammering. India would be banking on its spinners - R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja who both impressed in Vizag to replicate their performance in the decider. West IndiesWest Indies would be cock-a-hoop after their thrilling series-leveling victory. Kieran Powell, the replacement for Chris Gayle made the most of the opportunity and sparkled with a fluent 59. Johnson Charles has also looked in good touch. Darren Bravo with two consecutive fifties has been the stand-out batsman for the visitors. Lendl Simmons was involved in a match-changing partnership with Darren Sammy in Vizag. The only disappointment for the West Indies has been the performance of Marlon Samuels who has failed to make any impact on the series thus far. Skipper, Dwayne Bravo and Sammy can provide the impetus at the death. The latter has already shown his prowess with an unbeaten match-winning half-century in the previous match. Ravi Rampaul picked up 4 wickets in Vizag and has bowled with zest and heart. Jason Holder has got extra bounce with his height and troubled the Indian batsmen with the new ball. Sunil Narine was very economical in the last encounter but hasn't been amongst the wickets. With Bravo, Sammy and Permaul also a part of their bowling armoury, the West Indies have quite a variety at their disposal. Stats and Trivia - West Indies' last bilateral ODI series win against India dates back to 2006 when as hosts they beat the touring Indian side 4-1. - West Indies' last bilateral ODI series win against India on Indian soil dates back to 2002/03 when they beat the hosts 4-3 in a seven-match series. - Ravindra Jadeja is the joint leader (along with Saeed Ajmal) amongst the wicket-takers in ODI cricket for 2013. - Ravi Rampaul is two short of completing 100 ODI career wickets. He will become the 14th West Indian to reach the milestone should he achieve the feat. - The last international hosted by the Green Park in Kanpur was a Test match between India and Sri Lanka in November 2009 which the hosts won comfortably. Pitch and Weather ConditionsMS Dhoni was unhappy with the evening dew in Vizag which affected the Indian bowlers adversely as they found it hard to grip the ball. It will not be a factor in Kanpur, with the match slated to be a day game. However, an early start in the winter in the northern Indian city would mean that overnight dew will affect the conditions in the morning. As such, the captain winning the toss would certainly put the opposition in to make use of the morning juice in the wicket. A bright and sunny Wednesday is expected in Kanpur. The wicket is expected to offer some purchase for the faster men in the first hour before easing out to be a belter. QuotesWe believe we can beat anybody anywhere in any conditions. It's just for us to put the pieces of the puzzle together now: Kieran Powell after West Indies leveled the series in Vizag. He is someone who can bat well at No. 4, someone who can really dominate the opposition. Once he gets a few runs, you'll see a different Yuvraj Singh: MS Dhoni defends Yuvraj Singh's poor form. There will be no dearth of support for the home team in Kanpur. But the West Indies team will have enough motivation of their own - after all a series win against India in India is rare! The stage is set for the mini finale. India would want to end the home season on a high. Will the tourists spoil the Indian party or will MS Dhoni's men paint the Green Park Blue?
