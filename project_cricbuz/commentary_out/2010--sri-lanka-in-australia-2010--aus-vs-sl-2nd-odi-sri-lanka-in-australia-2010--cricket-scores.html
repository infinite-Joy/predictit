There is also a Muralitharan. We are in for a cracker of a contest. This is Ajith and I will take you through.As things stand now, Aussies will bat and they need to chase 244 in 39 overs.2:20 IST (7.50 PM local) Well, the covers are coming off. That's good news! We'll keep you posted with the latest.2:00 PM IST: (7:30 PM local) It is raining heavily at the moment, and the TV commentators believe that it would take another half an hour at least for the rain to ease down.1:30 PM IST: (7:00 PM local) The news coming out from the middle is that the Sri Lankan innings is over. We will be back with the revised target and the number of overs.A thought to ponder upon: The match was previously reduced to a 45 over a side affair after we lost 90 minutes of play due to rain, before the current stoppage. But in spite of that, there was a 45 minute dinner break that was scheduled. Some rules that the ICC follows does surprise us.Rain stops playThe drizzle gets heavier and the umpire asks the gentlemen on the field to move towards the pavilion. The covers are on and we are in for yet another delay. It is so frustrating, especially when two batsmen are going great guns!4

First things first, Happy Diwali to one and all. It would have been demoralising for the Aussies to lose by such a small margin, especially after dominating the first three quarters of the Sri Lankan innings. The Lankan Lions on the other hand will be looking for a historic series win down under. This is Ajith and I will bring you all the action today. Stay tuned for the toss info and other updates..By Gokul GopalIt is not often that Australia find themselves in a situation where they are in search of a much-needed win. But this has been the case with the Kangaroos in the past couple of months. Following their beating in India, the Aussies suffered losses at home in the one-off T20 and the 1st ODI against Sri Lanka.Australia:The Australians were decent with the bat during the first ODI, but failed to convert good starts into big scores. Barring Michael Hussey, who scored a gritty 71, the likes of Haddin, Clarke and Marsh began well but could not continue in the same vein for Australia to post a big score. Defending a modest total of 239, the Australians thought they had Sri Lanka on the mat when the tourists were reduced to 107/8. But a 132-run 9th wicket partnership between Angelo Mathews and Lasith Malinga ruined the Aussie party.The indifferent form of the middle order has been a concern for sometime. The home team felt the absence of Ricky Ponting, who had to miss the 1st ODI in order to attend his grand mother's funeral. While Ponting would be back to skipper the side for the 2nd game, the Australian side would be without the services of Shaun Marsh, who has been ruled of the series after injuring his lower back. Batting is the strength of the current Australian setup and the likes of Clarke, Watson, Ponting, Haddin and White have to stand up and make it count.In the bowling department, the Australians have unearthed a potential match-winner in the form of Xavier Doherty, who in his debut match against Sri Lanka came up with an impressive spell of spin bowling, picking up 4/46. The likes of Peter Siddle, Mitchell Johnson and John Hastings are also part of the ODI setup and overall, the bowling department depicts a settled unit.Sri Lanka:The Sri Lankans, unlike their previous ventures in Australia, have been on the money right from the start, holding the home team by the throat. They are now in a position to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three match series. However, the tourists have a lot of work at hand if they are to achieve that. While the bowling performance of the Lankans has been up to the mark in the T20 game and the 1st ODI, the same cannot be said about the batting.It has been a roller-coaster performance from the Sri Lankan top order during their endeavours in the past few months. Like the Australians, they too have not been consistent in their performances with the bat. Barring a couple of decent scores from captain Kumar Sangakkara and the remarkable fight-back by Angelo Mathews and Lasith Malinga, the others have been quite inconsistent. With the majority of the current squad likely to be the Lankan fire-power during the World Cup, this is the right time for the team from the Island Nation to identify the weak-spots and give it the necessary tweak.There cannot be any dearth of action in the second ODI as the Sri Lankans seek their first ever series win in Australia while the home team would be doing their best to deny them that.Teams:Australia (From): Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, Brad Haddin(w), John Hastings, David Hussey, Clint McKay, Dirk Nannes, Steve O'Keefe, Peter Siddle, Steven Smith, David Warner, Shane Watson, Michael Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Starc, Xavier DohertySri Lanka (From): Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Dilhara Fernando, Suraj Randiv, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Muttiah Muralitharan, Thissara Perera, Dammika Prasad, Chamara Silva, Upul TharangaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
