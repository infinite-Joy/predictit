Zimbabwe don't have any pressure, but we will always feel when things are not going our way. The batsmen are getting starts, but are not going on to make big scores. We are playing an unchanged side.Taylor: We will bowl first as we won the first game chasing. If we spend some time at the crease we can bat much better. It's a final today and we hope to do well. We should enjoy playing and don't feel about the pressure. Just the 2 changes for the final ODI.Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to field08:57 Local Time: Hello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the final ODI between Zimbabwe and Pakistan. There was a lot of suspense over whether this match will go ahead, will all those protests in the Zimbabwe camp. For now, things have cooled down and we are ready for the action to begin.Preview:Pakistan made up for the shock defeat in the first game to complete a crushing 90-run win over the hosts and level the 3-match ODI series 1-1. Putting the first match disaster behind them, the visitors will be looking forward to repeat their sensational performance and seal the series. On the other hand, Zimbabwe will be desperate to win against a top-ranked side and create history by winning the decider.ZimbabweAfter a solid first match performance, Zimbabwe were very ordinary in the second losing by a big margin of 90 runs. The bowling was not up to the mark as the hosts allowed the visitors to put up a good total of 299. The pace and spin attack lacked the discipline shown in the first match as they failed to take wickets at regular intervals. Zimbabwe were very economical in the first 20 overs, after which their bowling deteriorated as the Pakistani batsmen piled up runs in the middle and death overs.While chasing the huge total, they never really got going as the openers failed to provide them a good start. Only their skipper Brendan Taylor led by example as he hit a fluent 79. Taylor put up a 65-run stand with Waller for the fifth wicket and at that point it looked like the hosts were on their way to creating history. However, after losing Taylor and Waller on back-to-back deliveries, Zimbabwe struggled to stabilize. As long as Zimbabwe stick to the plan, start off well and concentrate on bowling economically in the death overs, they have a good chance of proving themselves in the series decider. Taylor has indicated that the team might make a couple of changes in the hope of getting their combination right for this crucial match.PakistanAfter a humiliating loss in the first match, Pakistan made amends by squaring the series in the second game putting up an all-round performance. For the first 20 overs they struggled to score runs but Hafeez powered the score with a fast-paced and brilliantly built innings of 136. He was ably assisted first by Umar Amin (59) putting up a 129-run stand with him and then by Shahid Afridi (39*) putting up a 86-run stand with him. Pakistan possess a solid batting unit and if they get a chance to bat first they will make sure they put up a competitive total on board.Bowling-wise the visitors were fantastic addressing the problems of the previous match. The decision of playing Abdur Rehman instead of Haris Sohail paid off as the latter bowled economically and even picked up two wickets. Junaid Khan was the player of the match for his impressive spell of 4 for 15 in 7 overs. Other bowlers also supported them well. Pakistan will undoubtedly stick to their winning combination and avoid further embarrassment by clinching the series.SquadsZimbabwe (Probable XI): Brendan Taylor (c/wk), Hamilton Masakadza, Vusi Sibanda, Timycen Maruma, Sean Williams, Malcolm Waller, Elton Chigumbura, Prosper Utseya, Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai Chatara, Brian Vitori.
