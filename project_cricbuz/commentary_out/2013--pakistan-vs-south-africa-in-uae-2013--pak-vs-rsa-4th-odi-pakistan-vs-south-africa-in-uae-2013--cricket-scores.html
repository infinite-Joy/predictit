We have made two changes Junaid Khan comes in for Wahab Riaz, Umar Amin makes way for debutant Sohaib Maqsood. I don't think it will turn much but it is certainly going to slow down a lot. We need to improve our performance as a batting unit. You just cannot rely on one or two guys when you are up against quality teams."AB de Villiers: "We will bat first and put pressure on Pakistan again. Just want a better performance from the boys today, I was happy with the previous game. We did very well the other day. We go in with the same team. Pakistan can bounce back, they are a quality team. It will be a great achievement if we can win the series tonight."South Africa have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "There are a lot of cracks on this wicket, it looks even drier than the previous game. That means that the ball will spin a lot more and it will slow down quite considerably. Captain winning the toss should consider himself very lucky," reckons Kepler Wessels.The 5-match series is at 2-1 in favour of South Africa. Will the Proteas seal the series with a win tonight? Or, will Pakistan bounce back to fight for the cup in the final game? Let's find out as the day progresses, hello and welcome for the fourth 50-over game between the two sides. We are still at Abu Dhabi where the visitors won the previous game by a comfortable margin. There is no doubt that the momentum is still with them. This series so far has been quite similar to the one in 2010. Pakistan would take heart from the fact that they won the 4th ODI then and squared the series 2-2. The pitch here in the last ODI supported the batsmen and it is not expected to change too much. However, the team combination could differ, especially in the Pakistani camp. We will get you the word from the captains at the toss in a short while, stay tuned...Teams:Pakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Amin, Saeed Ajmal, Abdur Rehman, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Irfan, Asad Shafiq, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Nasir Jamshed, Sarfraz Ahmed, Shahid Afridi, Sohaib Maqsood, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Akmal(w), Wahab RiazSouth Africa (From): Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers(w/c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Robin Peterson, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Quinton de Kock, Ryan McLaren, David Miller, Wayne Parnell, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Henry DavidsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
