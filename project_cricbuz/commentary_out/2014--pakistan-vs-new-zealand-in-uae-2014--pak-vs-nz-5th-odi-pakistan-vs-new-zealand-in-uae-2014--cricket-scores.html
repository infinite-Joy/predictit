Matt Henry will open the attackWelcome back. Pakistan bat deep and will look to change their poor record in the series deciders. Can they do it? Let's find out.The Pakistani bowlers looked good in patches. They started off well and the spinners maintained a strong hold on the scoring rate during the middle overs. But at the end, they lost their plot and combined with some good batting, they gave plenty away during the last few overs. Now, it is upto the Pakistani batsmen to chase this total down. Be rest assured that it is not going to be easy. The pitch is a little slower and the ball might stop on the batsmen as well. However, it is also not impossible to go after a total like this as we found out in the last game. The Pakistani innings will come to you in a short while from now. Stay tuned.Taylor looked good as well. After Williamson fell, Ronchi joined him at the crease and both of them together were looking for some quick runs. Ronchi fell shortly after hitting a six and then Latham walked out. Both Latham and Taylor then continued their aggressive hitting, managing to score 51 runs off the last 5 overs.So, New Zealand finish their innings on 275/4. After a slow start, where they lost the wicket of Guptill early, both Brownlie and Williamson steadied things before the former fell. Williamson and Taylor then batted well through the middle stages and made sure that they don't collapse. Williamson continued his good form and was looking all set to reach yet another hundred, but got out just three runs short of what would have been a great knock.4

Matches 12, Won 1, Lost 11Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi(c), Anwar Ali, Zulfiqar Babar, Mohammad IrfanNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Dean Brownlie, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Tom Latham, Anton Devcich, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghanShahid Afridi: 'This is a decider game and it is a very important game. The boys are motivated and we have done a lot of experiment. It is time to have more experience. I just want to relax and play like that (talking about his own batting performances). We have made two changes, Hafeez is struggling with his hamstring, Asad Shafiq comes in his place. We are going with an extra spinner, Zulfiqar Babar comes in place of Sohail Tanvir.'Kane Williamson: 'We will bat first. It's a used surface and we have got a few changes. We have plenty of injuries and we have changed our side a number of times before. Nathan McCullum and Anton Devcich are back in.'New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: 'It is a little bit cooler here today. We will see a lot more runs. It looks like the same pitch we had on Wednesday. The ground staff have done really well to fill the cracks. The team batting first should try and score as many runs as possible,' reckons Scott Styris.In the last ODI, Kane Williamson was the chief architect of the win, notching up another century to help his team post 299. For Pakistan, Younis Khan and Shahid Afridi looked really good and at one point, it looked like Pakistan will win as well. But, New Zealand managed to hold onto their nerves and managed to square the series yet again. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.It all comes down to this match to see which team ends up on the winning side. Throughout the tour, New Zealand had their backs to the wall with Pakistan always taking the lead across all three formats. However, the Black Caps have always made a great comeback to level the series.Hello and welcome to the final ODI between Pakistan and New Zealand. This match promises to be a great contest and finally, one of the two teams will be crowned as the series winner. Such has been the tour that the Test series ended 1-1, the T20 series ended 1-1 and now the ODI series also stands at 2-2, but be rest assured that there will be a winner today. Even though a tie would have been a fitting end to the series, let's hope that we see another great contest with the bat and the ball.Preview:Overview:Every time Pakistan got their noses in front, New Zealand came back to level things. Such has been the series. The Test series was drawn, the T20s were split and now the ODI series stands at 2-2 as the tour moves on to its final game in Abu Dhabi. The two teams deserve praise for the way they've handled off-field activities and yet served up tasteful contests. A win would do wonders to the confidence of the teams ahead of the big ticket event in Australia-New Zealand, even if the conditions in UAE and those expected in the Southern hemisphere are polar opposites of each other. A loss would leave a sour after-taste.New Zealand:New Zealand have bowled well in the ODIs with an attack that was called 'second-string', ahead of the series. Their use of the short-ball as a weapon on UAE pitches, not usually conducive to pacers, has been heartening. Adam Milne has constantly hurried batsman with his pace and Matt Henry and co. have been more than capable. However, New Zealand's bowling hero in the 4th ODI, Daniel Vettori, will miss the final game after flying back to New Zealand to attend his brother's wedding. Nathan McCullum is expected be his replacement. Dean Brownlie and Martin Guptill would be expected to give another solid start, as they did in the last game, for the skipper, Kane Williamson to settle in and continue his purple run of form.Pakistan:Pakistan have suffered top-order trouble in the series. Too often they've relied on the lower middle-order to bail them out. Stand-in skipper, Shahid Afridi, almost did it again for them in the last game but they will be well served with a meaty contribution from their openers. The return to form of senior pro, Younis Khan, would have been welcomed by the management. All-rounder Haris Sohail has provided vital breakthroughs for them but is yet to get going with the bat. Mohammad Hafeez batted at No.4 in the last game and looked out of sorts. A call would be taken on his batting position before the game. Pakistan also fielded poorly in the last game, something that was acknowledged by the captain and the coach. They will also look to remedy that.Statistics:Shahid Afridi, with 49 in the last innings, fell one short of scoring three half-centuries in a five-match ODI series for the first time.Weather and Conditions:The pitch is expected to play much like it did in the fourth ODI. Slow and flat. Win toss and bat-first. However Pakistan nearly chased down 300 the other day. That may need consideration. The weather is expected to hold good for the day.Quotes:"This series is for us to utilize and get a clearer picture on our final 15 for the World Cup" - Waqar Younis"It's such a big ground that you can score freely" - Kane WilliamsonTeams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Dean Brownlie, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Mitchell McClenaghan, Matt Henry, Adam Milne, Nathan McCullum, Tom Latham, Anton DevcichPakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Nasir Jamshed, Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan, Haris Sohail, Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi(c), Sohail Tanvir, Mohammad Irfan, Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Asad Shafiq, Zulfiqar Babar, Yasir ShahLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
