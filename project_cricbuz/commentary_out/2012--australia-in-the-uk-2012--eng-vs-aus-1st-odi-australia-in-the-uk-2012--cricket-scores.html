This is the last international match that will be played at Lords before the Olympics. Brett Lee will start off proceedings. Sid V here to take you through for the England inningsTeams:Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Shane Watson, George Bailey, Michael Clarke(c), David Hussey, Steven Smith, Matthew Wade(w), Brett Lee, Clint McKay, Pat Cummins, Xavier DohertyEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Craig Kieswetter(w), Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Steven FinnAustralia have won the toss and elected to fieldConditions are currently overcast at Lords. There is some rain predicted later in the day and we hope that it stays away.Welcome one and all to the first ODI between England and Australia from Lords. This series is being viewed as a curtain-raiser for the Ashes contest next year and it will be interesting to see which team comes out on top. England defeated Australia 3-2 in the last ODI series played in England between these two teams in 2010. However, Australia are a much stronger outfit this time around and they will look to avenge that loss. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Not always does an ODI series between England and Australia start without the latter being the clear favorites. Atleast, in the last decade or this has been the case. However for the five match ODI series starting tomorrow it is hard to pick a clear favorite. England have been on a roll in ODIs in recent times after Alastair Cook took over. Australia have been no different under Michael Clarke and that sets up a rather intriguing contest.England:Alastair Cook has had a dream start to his captaincy stint. Hiw own personal fortunes as well as the team's form has been on an upswing. England have secured four series' wins under Cook. Their only loss came against India in India. The win against West Indies being the most recent one and that series has helped England try out some new combinations in the aftermath of Kevin Pietersen's surprise retirement. Ian Bell's good form has masked the absence of KP in the series against West Indies but the middle order remains a concern for England. Howeverm it does provide yet another opportunity for the likes of Johnny Bairstow and Ravi Bopara to seal a spot in the ODI eleven.The bowling has a more balanced look about it. The strategy of going in with five bowlers seems to be working well for England. Stuart Broad, Tim Bresnan and Graeme Swann are no mugs with the bat either. Alastair Cook will be relying on his world class bowling attack more than the batting to provide the game changing moments.Australia:That Australia are a team in transition was never in doubt. They have managed to sail over things pretty smoothly in recent times but facing a world class England side in their own backyard will pose a wholly different challenge. One look at the squad is enough to tell you that it is Australia's untested batting line up that will face its biggest challenge. David Warner might have made rapid strides in the recent past but facing James Anderson and Co in the seam friendly England conditions will be one of his toughest tests. Australia will rely heavily on the trio of Michael Clarke, Shane Watson and David Hussey to lead the way for the other batsmen.While there is nothing much to call for between the batting line up of the two teams, there is definitely a stark difference in bowling, atleast in terms of experience. Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson will have to shoulder the responsibility of leading an attack that contains two of Australia's brightest young pace prospects who are returning from injury. Expectations are high from James Pattinson and Pat Cummins and Clarke is bound to have a tough time in getting his bowling combination right. Xavier Doherty has impressed in the chances he has got so far and should be a shoo in into the final eleven unless conditions call for an extra seamer.Final Word:England hold a slight edge going into the series but they will be wary of the Aussies who seem to reserve their best for the Old Blighty.
