We want to bowl fist and put pressure on Pakistan. There is some mositure in the air, the pitch will swing a bit. Looking forward to Dale and the boys to exploit it.

Still no official news about the toss though09:28 Local Time, 07:28 GMT, 12:58 IST: Not so good news. It is drizzling at Port Elizabeth. The covers are on. Looks like the toss will be delayed.An interesting side note to this encounter- South Africa are featuring in their 500th ODI. A huge rain threat though looms large over this clash. Toss, teams and weather updates to follow shortly. Do stay tuned folks.Meanwhile, the hosts need to shore up their batting to counter the strong Pakistan bowling.South Africa's batting on Sunday would have been even more embarrassing had it not been for a fine half-century from the returning Jacques Kallis. With Graeme Smith's grandmother passing away on Tuesday, he remains an iffy starter for this game. Incase Smith sits out, Quinton de Kock is expected to open the batting.A very warm welcome to the second ODI between South Africa and Pakistan at Port Elizabeth. After their insipid display in the UAE, Pakistan turned the tables around quite dramatically, engineering back to back victories in Cape Town. Having prevailed in a tense finish in the opening ODI, courtesy an inspired performance from debutants- Anwar Ali and Bhilawal Bhatti- Misbah's boys will be fired up to secure an unassailable 2-0 lead and with it fashion their maiden bilateral series win versus South Africa.Preview by Gokul GopalAfter their dismal performance in the United Arab Emirites, Pakistan have done a lot better in South Africa's backyard and now have the opportunity to register the first ever bilateral ODI series win against the Proteas. Meanwhile, the hosts, who have lost two matches in a row - the second T20I and the first ODI - will be looking to bounce back and square the three-match series. Both teams will also have their fingers crossed in hopes of a full game as rain is predicted during the day.South Africa: The hosts have not quite been up to the mark in their home-series against Pakistan. South Africa had rain and Duckworth Lewis to thank for their narrow win in the opening T20I but after that, they have hardly come up with a solid performance. South African batsmen are mainly to blame for that as they have struggled to counter the Pakistani bowlers. Hashim Amla, who has been in decent form, failed in the opening ODI while Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers did not contribute much. Quinton de Kock and David Miller also failed while Jacques Kallis and JP Duminy came up with fighting efforts in Cape Town, but their knocks went in vain. A line-up that has Smith and Amla at the top, de Kock, Kallis and de Villers to follow and Duminy and Miller in the lower middle order, is one that should intimidate any opposition. However, they cannot take things for granted and need to show better application.South Africa's bowling attack is as formidable as their batting with the presence of world-class pace bowlers like Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander and Kallis to provide them back-up. Their efforts in the opening ODI could not be faulted as Steyn and Morkel picked up three wickets apiece and bowled economically. Philander kept posing questions and conceded very less, although he had only one wicket to speak for his efforts. Kallis was among the wickets too but he was a touch expensive. Imran Tahir and Duminy bowled a few tight overs of spin to keep the Pakistan batsmen in check. However, it must be said that the bowlers leaked some runs in the death overs, letting Pakistan score in excess of 200. South Africa will be looking to rectify those errors and come up with an improved effort in what is a must-win game for them.Pakistan: While they have done well to win back-to-back games, Pakistan still have some issues to address, especially in the batting department. Openers Nasir Jamshed and Ahmed Shehzad have not been converting their starts while Sohaib Maqsood too got out after starting well. Mohammad Hafeez and Umar Akmal, who did well in the T20s, failed to come good in the first ODI while skipper Misbah-ul-Haq also fell cheaply. If not for debutant all-rounders Anwar Ali and Bilawal Bhatti, who came up with defiant knocks, Pakistan would have not even reached the 218/9 they eventually managed. While the total was sufficient for Pakistan to prevail in the opening ODI, their batsmen will have to come up with a better showing and not rest their hopes only on the bowlers.Pakistan's bowlers have always come to the team's rescue and same was the case in the opening ODI. Although they did not have too many runs to play with, they came up with a superb bowling effort to contain the power-packed South African side and helped the visitors take a 1-0 lead. The experienced bowlers like Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi did a good job as did pacer Junaid Khan. But what stood-out and pleased the followers of the game, was the efforts of Anwar and Bilawal, who also did well with the ball to help their side defend a low total. Pakistan's bowling line-up always presents itself as a settled unit and it is no different when it comes to this bowling attack. All the visitors will be hoping for is that the bowlers continue doing a good job and help Pakistan clinch their first ever series win against South Africa.Team News: While two of Pakistan's most experienced all-rounders - Abdul Razzaq and Shoaib Malik - were ruled out of the tour due to injuries, the youngsters in the side have done a tremendous job and have made up for their absence. Pakistan are unlikely to tinker with the winning combination, which means that the likes of Abdur Rehman, Asad Shafiq, Umar Amin and Sohail Tanvir will be left on the sidelines. South Africa too are unlikely to make any changes to their eleven.Numbers:12: The number of runs Graeme Smith requires to reach the mark of 7000 in ODI cricket. In case he gets there in the second ODI, Smith will become only the third South African after Jacques Kallis and Herschelle Gibbs with 7000 or more in the 50-over format.7: The number of bilateral ODI series Pakistan have played against South Africa and have lost.500: The match at Port Elizabeth will be South Africa's 500th appearance in ODI cricket. Among all Test playing nations, South Africa's win percentage (63.78) is the second best after Australia (64.08).Teams:South Africa (From): Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Lonwabo TsotsobePakistan (From): Nasir Jamshed, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sohaib Maqsood, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Bilawal Bhatti, Anwar Ali, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Abdur Rehman, Asad Shafiq, Sohail Tanvir, Umar AminLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
