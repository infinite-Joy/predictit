The bowlers were completely listless against a mighty batting line up. Most of the fielders were not able to cope up with the heat as they struggled with cramps. Jayawardene scored his 13th ODI hundred, and the fastest ton by a Sri Lankan in World Cups as he reached the landmark in just 80 deliveries.No threats of rain yet, though there were a couple of dark clouds at some stage in the Sri Lankan innings. The over rate was pretty bad by Canada, as a result of which, the lunch break may only last for fifteen minutes. Do join us shortly for the Canadian run chase.4

Don't go away, we'll be back with more updates...by Gokul GopalWhile tournament favourites India emerged victorious in the opening game of the World Cup against co-hosts Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the third country hosting the 2011 edition and also considered one of the favourites, take on a relatively unknown entity in Canada.
Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara admitted that his knowledge of Canada is only confined to the 40-year-old John Davison, who once scored the fastest World Cup hundred, a record broken by Australian Matthew Hayden four years later. However, Sri Lanka would be not bother much about this as they look to start their World Cup campaign with a rousing victory.Head to Head:The two countries have played each other only once. They faced off in the 2003 edition of the World Cup during which Sri Lanka handed a comprehensive defeat to Canada. The Canadian team was bowled out cheaply for just 36 runs at Paarl, which still remains to be the lowest total in a World Cup game.Build up to the game:Sri Lanka: The Lankans, on home-soil, are one of the most formidable sides, and the opposition would also be wary of their current form as the co-hosts look to be in great shape. In November 2010, Sri Lanka won their first ever ODI series against Australia in Australia and followed that up with a confident 2-0 win against West Indies at home a couple of weeks back. They also won their two WC warm-up matches quite comfortably. They posted a formidable 351/5 during their 156 run win against Netherlands in the first game while they chased down 282 against West Indies in their second warm-up match. The batsmen have been in fine nick with Tharanga, Dilshan, Samaraweera, Sangakkara, Kapugedara and Chamara Silva all getting decent hits out at the middle and they are likely to relish the inexperienced Canadian bowling attack. The Lankan bowlers look fit and all raring to go and the Canadian batsmen would have to watch-out for Malinga and Muralitharan, who are likely to cause the most problems.Canada: Although minnows, the Canadians cannot be taken lightly during the World Cup. Sri Lanka would be aware of the North American team's confident performance against England in the warm-up match. England managed to eke out a narrow 16-run win over Canada thanks to a Stuart Broad five-for following an unexpected assault from little-known Rizwan Cheema. Chasing 243, the Pakistan-born Cheema scored a blistering 93 off 71 balls and was involved in good stands with Zubin Surkari and Khurram Chohan to bring Canada close to the target before Broad wrapped things up for the English. However, what would not help Canada's cause was that their top five batsmen managed just 17 runs between them in the same match. They need to improve drastically, going up against the likes of Malinga and Kulasekara as well as the leading wicket-taker in the world - Muralitharan.Pitch and Ground conditions:The Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium, Hambantota will be hosting its first ever ODI when the home-team play their opening World Cup encounter against Canada. The new venue is still untested after consistent rain in this region of the country over the past couple of months has hardly given the pitch to settle down. Even the warm-up games scheduled here had to be moved to the Sinhalese Sports Club due to the torrential rain. The wicket is expected to assist the slow bowlers but it still remains to be seen if we get a complete game as rain is forecast for Sunday.Captains speak:I don't think when we go to play sides that we haven't played much that we should worry because in those games it's all about us, how well we do and how well we play our cricket. I think we don't need to be negative and we must make sure that we beat them without problems: Kumar Sangakkara.Obviously Muralitharan and Malinga are the big threats but if we can get through a couple of their bowlers we have a good chance. It is a new venue, even they won't know what to expect, so it's going to be tough for both the teams: Ashish BagaiTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Thilan Samaraweera, Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Muttiah Muralitharan, Thissara Perera, Chamara SilvaCanada (From): Hiral Patel, John Davison, Ruvindu Gunasekera, Ashish Bagai(w/c), Jimmy Hansra, Zubin Surkari, Rizwan Cheema, Nitish Kumar, Karl Whatham, Harvir Baidwan, Khurram Chohan, Balaji Rao, Parth Desai, Tyson Gordon, Henry OsindeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
