Two slips in place..Teams:India (Playing XI): Lokesh Rahul, Faiz Fazal, Ambati Rayudu, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni(w/c), Axar Patel, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jasprit Bumrah, Barinder Sran, Yuzvendra ChahalZimbabwe (Playing XI): Hamilton Masakadza, Chamu Chibhabha, Vusi Sibanda, Timycen Maruma, Malcolm Waller, Elton Chigumbura, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Graeme Cremer(c), Neville Madziva, Tawanda Mupariwa, Donald TiripanoDhoni: "Ideally we were looking to bowl first. It is an early morning start and there is going to be a bit of moisture. It may slow down as the game progresses, but it will remain good. Only one change for us, Fazal in for Karun Nair. We focus mainly on the process than the result. As a bowling department we have done well and the batters have made use of whatever little opportunity they have got."Cremer: "We will have a bat. The wicket looks better. They have removed the grass. The cracks might open up late on. Quite happy to have won the toss. We have a few changes, Peter Moor and Sikandar Raza miss out, Malcolm Waller and Timycen Maruma come in."Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to batPitch report: "This is a new pitch. This is probably the best wicket of the series. It is hard and there is no grass. There are a bit of cracks and the ball will deviate. If I win the toss, I will bat first," says Pat Symcox.Alan Wilkins just confirmed that it will be Karun Nair making way for Faiz Fazal. So, KL Rahul and Fazal at the top of the order for India.- If India wins the third ODI, it will be the first ODI series whitewash under MS Dhoni away from home.- The last time Zimbabwe beat India in an ODI in a bilateral series was way back in March 2002 in Kochi. Since then India have won all 12 matches between the two sides.- Vusi Sibanda needs 44 more runs to become the eight player to score 3000 ODI runs for Zimbabwe. Only Elton Chigumbura (140 innings) has taken more innings to reach the landmark for Zimbabwe.- Indian pacers average of 14.38 is the best for them in an ODI series where they sent down at least 50 overs. They have taken 13 wickets at an economy rate of 3.67.- KL Rahul's aggregate of 133 runs after two ODIs is the second highest among Indians after 148 by Navjot Singh Sidhu who scored 73 & 75 in his first two ODIs.- Hamilton Masakadza is the only Zimbabwe batsman to aggregate more than 100 runs this calendar year after five ODIs.- The Zimbabwe batsmen average 13.89 per wicket in this series - the least for them in an ODI series involving India.There is news coming in that Faiz Fazal has been handed his maiden ODI cap by the Indian skipper. So, there is going to be one change for the visitors. But, we don't have an update as to who will make way for the Vidarbha opener. The most likely one to miss out will be - KL Rahul as the Karnataka lad has had two good outings. Will there be any other changes? The bowling has fired in both the games and Dhoni is not known for his rotation policy. It will interesting to see whether he will give his batsmen more time in the middle, if he wins the toss. Lots of speculations regarding the Indian team, the toss and teams will be coming up shortly before that, here are some numbers from our statsman Deepu Narayanan....The series has already been won by India 2-0. Today's encounter is a dead-rubber. However, the hosts have a lot on the line. The fans, who turned up to the previous two games were disappointed with the home sides performance. Here's a chance for Zimbabwe to make some redemption. Graeme Cremer has acknowledged that his side has underperformed and has urged the supporters to be patient. Can they put up a better display and register a consolation win? Or Dhoni and Co. will complete the whitewash?Preview by Prakash Govindasreenivasan.Things went from bad to worse for the hosts as Zimbabwe allowed India to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the One-Day International (ODI) series on Monday (June 13) and earned the wrath of their emotional fans. The loyal supporters turned on the players after they witnessed a batting collapse soon after an innings-defining partnership between Sikandar Raza and Vusi Sibanda. While the Indian team took the day off, Zimbabwe hit the nets on the eve of the last ODI under the supervision of Makhaya Ntini and Lance Klusner, the head coach and batting coach of the side. While the sessions may help, it will come down to their ability to apply themselves in the middle if they are to avoid letting India complete a series sweep. The toss has had quite an impact in the first two games, with India fielding first and bundling out the hosts cheaply on both occasions. While form has deserted them, Zimbabwe will hope a little luck could give them company in the final fixture.Team news:India: MS Dhoni spent some time whacking some throwdowns in the nets on Monday but it's unlikely he will push himself up the order. It remains to be seen if India give their bench-warmers a go in the last outing before the T20 leg. The likes of Faiz Fazal, Mandeep Singh, Jayant Yadav, Jaydev Unadkat and Rishi Dhawan are yet to play in the series so far, and with the series sealed, the Indian team, could look at giving some of their players a game.Zimbabwe: Zimbabwe too could look at making changes in the dead rubber. If Sean Williams doesn't recover from his finger injury, Timycen Maruma could be considered. Young spinner Wellington Masakadza could also be drafted in.Who said whatMakhaya Ntini: We haven't been able to be in a position to be able to conquer what we need to conquer. We haven't batted very well, our bowlers are very good but there's no score that they can defend. Everyone still believe that they can do it. There's no change in that.Did you know:If India win the third ODI, it will be the first ODI series whitewash for India under MS Dhoni away from home. The last time Zimbabwe beat India in an ODI in a bilateral series was way back in March 2002 in Kochi.
