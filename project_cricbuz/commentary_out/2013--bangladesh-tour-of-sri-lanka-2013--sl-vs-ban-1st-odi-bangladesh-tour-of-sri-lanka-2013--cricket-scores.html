Janith Perera is on strike. Abul Hasan will open the attackSo the players are out at the centre, all set for the start.The target will be 238 for Sri Lanka in 41 overs. We will have 12 overs of field restrictions, a mandate 8-over power play and a 4-over batting power play.So the official word is that this will be a 41-over run chase with a revised target. The game will begin at 20:30 local time.20:03 Local Time: Looks like we will have a lengthy break. No signs of play starting any soon. As I type, the lights are flickering back on and we should have play starting soon.19:30 local time: Russell Arnold has tweeted that 2 light towers have gone out and it will take atleast 30 minutes to restore power.And the latest is, the lights which were coming up, have gone off completely now. It is enjoying a see-saw game.. Will bring you the latest.Welcome back for the Sri Lankan run chase. And again, the one of the light towers has gone off and there will be a little delay. But the good news is that, slowly but steadily the lights are coming up. Not too far away from the start though...A fighting score by Bangladesh. Tamim Iqbal became the 1st Bangladeshi batsman to score a ODI ton against Sri Lanka and was followed by a sublime unbeaten 73 by Nasir Hossain. The duo have made sure that the visitors have a score to defend. The hosts were poor with the ball and are left with a tall order. Join us in a short while for the chase..4

The shorter formats of the game are a different kettle of fish altogether though and the Tigers would hope for a better show. The 1st match is all set to begin at Hambantota as a young Sri Lankan team will look to keep the victory march going. Toss in 15 minutes..Preview:Bangladesh will seek inspiration from their Asia Cup victory over Sri Lanka when they open a three-match one-day series in Hambantota on Saturday.Mushfiqur Rahim's Bangladeshis proved they were capable of surprising big teams in the shorter format of the game when they beat World Cup finalists India and Sri Lanka on their way to the Asia Cup final in Dhaka last year.Bangladesh, who registered their third one-day win over Sri Lanka in 30 matches, produced more encouraging results at home last year, including a series victory over the West Indies.The tourists also gave a good account of themselves in the opening Test against Sri Lanka in Galle before losing the second match and the series in Colombo recently."The way we played the first Test we can take a lot of positives. In the second Test, we bowled them out in one innings and that is quite a positive sign," Rahim said. "We have been really playing well over the last one-and-a-half years."Bangladesh's batting has been bolstered with the return of Mohammad Ashraful, who played his last one-dayer in October 2011. He looked in good touch in the recent Tests, scoring 190 in the opening match.Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews will be keen to complete a double as captain after leading his side to victory in the Test series."It was important to win the (Test) series whoever you play against. We were under pressure to win and I think we played some really good cricket," said the Sri Lankan skipper.Sri Lanka have also done well in recent one-dayers, winning a five-match series at home against New Zealand in November and then drawing a tough series 2-2 in Australia in January.The second match will also be played in Hambantota on Monday, before the final encounter in Pallekele on March 28.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal(w), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Shaminda Eranga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Jeevan Mendis, Sachith Pathirana, Angelo Perera, Thisara Perera, Kushal Janith Perera, Kithuruwan Vithanage, Kumar Sangakkara, Lahiru Thirimanne, Upul Tharanga, Sachithra SenanayakeBangladesh (From): Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Mohammad Ashraful, Abul Hasan, Mominul Haque, Nasir Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Tamim Iqbal, Mahmudullah, Anamul Haque, Jahurul Islam, Sohag Gazi, Abdur Razzak, Ziaur Rahman, Nazmul Hossain, Mosharraf HossainLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
