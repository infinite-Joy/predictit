Steyn has the new ball in his hands. Here we go with the first ball....Welcome back for the run chase. It is up to the batters now to see India through and level the series. The pitch seemed like a good one and they should fancy their chances. The Proteas will be ruining the fact that they didn't capitalize on the platform laid by the openers but with a strong bowling attack they might be able to restrict a formidable batting line-up.The Indian bowlers actually managed to pull things back in this game, when compared to the previous one but the last over from Umesh Yadav undid a lot of good work done until then. Before that South Africa had slipped up considerably after the departure of de Kock. The South African openers laid a superb platform yet again but this time the middle order could not capitalise fully. In the previous game, 100 runs were scored in the last 6 overs whereas today India gave away 'only' 70 in the last 10. That's the improvement Dhoni had called for. The outfield is very slow and it will be interesting to see how the Indian stroke-makers like this surface. Join us in a while for the chase.4

Just one change, Philander is fit and he replaces Wayne Parnell.'MS Dhoni: 'We will bowl first. Looks like a good wicket, it will remain same throughout the game. We managed a decent practice session yesterday. We did not bat well in Jo'burg, but I felt we could have bowled much better. Rahane replaces an unfit Yuvraj Singh. Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma are in as well.'India have won the toss and have opted to field10:54 Local Time, 08:54 GMT, 14:24 IST: Good news folks, the match will start at 11:30 local time.

It could be half past ten or later. We want conditions to improve. There are some areas in the outfield that are wet too. Both teams have been positive about it. It was wet yesterday but it has improved drastically. There is sawdust in the backward point area. We've asked the players to stay out of certain areas during practice. The breeze blowing should dry up the ground."09:34 Local Time, 07:34 GMT, 13:04 IST: The toss has been delayed. There is a big patch on the ground covered with sawdust and looks pretty wet. We are not sure how long the delay will be. We will keep you posted as and when we get more infoPitch Report: "The pitch looks very firm and lot less grass compared to the Wanderers. There won't be much seam movement and there will not be any steep bounce either, but the new ball will do a bit at the start, otherwise it is a good batting wicket", says Kepler Wessels.Toss and teams in a few minutes. Stay tuned. It will be interesting to see if Dhoni makes any changes in the team...Weather-wise South Africa is very unpredictable. An odd shower here and there is expected. But it does not seem like that will affect the match greatly.Here we are with the second match of the ODI series between South Africa and India at Durban and people have already started passing judgement over the weakness of the Indian team outside the sub-continent.We saw a completely dominating performance from the hosts in the first game in contrast with a listless Indian team that visibly struggled against the pace and bounce of the pitch. The quality of bowling was absolutely below par and the strong batting line-up that we boast of seemed very remarkably vulnerable.With a shortened tour and no practice matches to get used to, a young Indian brigade has found it agnonizingly difficult to adjust to the conditions. The only thing that India can hope for is fight back on basis of their batting strength as a win today is absolutely must if they have to keep the chances of winning the ODI series alive.Preview by PradeepThe atmosphere has been sombre in South Africa. It was set to be one of the biggest series of all times. The World Champions taking on the World No.1 Test team in their own home turf. Board politics made sure that the series lacked spark even before the first ball was bowled. With an abbreviated series consisting of 3 ODIs and 2 Tests, people believed that the original charm was lacking.The tour kicked off at the Bull-Ring on Thursday, and the quality of cricket, especially from the hosts left the crowds and the viewers on TV asking for more. The Indian bowling fizzled out in front of the aggressive Proteas and the batsmen had no clue, when up against the quality of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. The resultant 141 run thrashing was not just a heavy defeat, it has also dented the psyche of the Indians, with the tour still in its infancy period.The jubilation in the South African camp soon turned into sorrow and mourning as news of the passing away of one of the greatest pillars of South Africa, Nelson Mandela emerged. The series was no longer a priority for the South Africans, profits or losses did not matter for them, and the series was thrown into uncertainty. There were reports that the series might be rescheduled, but better sense prevailed and the South African board officially announced that the tour will continue as scheduled.Both teams have now moved from Johannesburg to Durban. The South Africans are in a buoyant mood while the Indians need to get over the debacle at Bull-Ring.The spicy track at the Wanderers was something that the Indians did not look prepared for. Their bowlers were unable to make the adjustment and paid the penalty for consistently bowling in wrong areas. The batsmen, who had successfully chased down 350 plus scores twice in the recent past against Australia, albeit in home conditions could not conjure up any fight as they were bamboozled by the pace and accuracy of the South Africans. In a short 3-match series, India have little time to recuperate as they enter a do-or-die scenario at Durban.South AfricaThings went very smoothly for the hosts at the Bull Ring. Their batting was filled with precision with Amla and de Kock having settled themselves at the top of the order. Their 152 run stand for the opening wicket at Johannesburg was their best ever stand and also South Africa's first century stand in an ODI match for four years. With a solid platform set, AB de Villiers and JP Duminy feasted on the hapless Indian bowling, plundering 135 runs in the last 10 overs.With a massive total on the board, the South African bowlers came into their own. Dale Steyn made Rohit Sharma look like a 'strokeless wonder'. Steyn's pace and swing left the Indians bewildered and the chase was as good as over by the time he had finished his opening spell. Morne Morkel found the bounce to his liking while the rest of the bowlers were decent. Vernon Philander sat out of the first match, but will be itching to have a go at the Indians at the Kingsmead.Team NewsCompared to his team-mates, Wayne Parnell's figures looked pale in comparison. A fit Philander (he passed fit after a shoulder blade strain) will more likely cause headache's to the Indian batsmen. The rest of the team selects by itself as the hosts will look to complete their fourth successive bilateral series win over India. Graeme Smith has been sent back to Cape Town to prepare for the upcoming Tests.IndiaHaving won six series on a stretch, India's big Test was always going to the series against South Africa. Having flunked the first match, they have now left themselves with plenty of work if they are to secure another series win. The bowling was all over the place, with Mohit Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar registering their worst ever bowling figures in a One Day International match. They were particularly poor in the death overs, often bowling length and letting the batsmen have a free run. Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, who spun a web in helpful bowling conditions at home, struggled to match their feats at Johannesburg.If the bowling was a worry, the batting, barring MS Dhoni and to an extent Virat Kohli, did not offer any semblance of relief for the Indians. Shikhar Dhawan was bounced out, Yuvraj Singh's old failings continued to haunt him while Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina ran themselves out. The wicket at Durban might not offer the same pace and bounce that Johannesburg offered, but India have been put under immense pressure by the hosts' bowlers.Team NewsThe heavy defeat in the first match has left the team management with quite a few worries. Since his comeback, Yuvraj Singh has struggled for any sort of form while his average in South Africa has been appalling. While the hosts went into the match with six pacers, India reposed faith in its two spinners, but the duo combined to go for plenty of runs. Mohit Sharma was off-colour and so was Bhuvaneshwar Kumar. Will India bring in Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav? Will Ambati Rayudu/Ajinkya Rahane get a go ahead of Yuvraj Singh?Pitch and Weather conditionsConditions are expected to be overcast on Sunday with an odd shower or two. The Durban pitch is usually a sportive one, with assistance for both the bowlers and the batsmen.QuotesMore than the death bowling, our bowling with the new ball was not up to the mark : A livid MS Dhoni blasted his bowlers after the first match.India are certainly not a poor bowling line up.
