Porterfield is on strike. Steyn will open the attackWelcome back to the Irish chase. SA did well to rally from 117/5 to a very healthy 272/7 thanks largely to a fine knock of 99 by J P Duminy. It will be quite a task for Ireland to successfully chase down this target against a attack which seems to be the most lethal of all the attacks so far in this tournamentA superb knock of 99 by J P Duminy spared the Proteas some serious blushes as they put up a competitive score on the board. The ground fielding from Ireland was a treat to one's eyes. Morne van Wyk was the chief beneficiery of the Irish largesse as he was dropped twice when on 4 and 23. Duminy though was not that lucky as Kevin O' Brien took an absolutely outstanding catch to dismiss him.The decision to bowl first seemed to be correct when Rankin removed the free stroking Amla pretty early into the innings thanks to a brilliant catch from young Dockrell. The sharpness in ground fielding was amply illustrated as Smith and Kallis found to their horror, both being run-out. The spinners, Dockrell and Stirling did no harm to their reputations with a fine spell of accurate bowling that put pressure on SA. SA were reduced to 117/5 at one stageDuminy though had other ideas as he put on two useful partnerships with the impressive Ingram, coming in the place of the injured ABD and Botha as SA rallied themselves back into a position of strength. Ireland will feel that they have the required batting to make a fist of this target, but it will be a huge task against a razor sharp bowling attack that has bowled out all the opponents until now. Do join us in a short while for the Irish chase.4

SOUTH AFRICA:49.4  Mooney to Duminy, out Caught by Kevin O'Brien !! That's as good a catch you can see, and one can't help but feel for Duminy who can't get to his hundred! He wanted to to get to his hundred with a biggie, got under the ball and looked to go over the top, ended up miscuing it, the ball balloons up in the air, there were two men running after the ball, Kevin from mid off and another fielder from long on, Kevin calls for it, keeps his eyes on the ball and dives full length, takes it inches off the ground. Not the easiest of catches as Kevin was running back. Duminy c Kevin O'Brien b Mooney 99(103) [4s-6 6s-1] Mooney to Duminy, THATS OUT!! Caught!!A loud cheer from the crowd as JP comes on strike!

SOUTH AFRICA:48.2  Johnston to Duminy, leg byes, 1 run, Duminy comes down the wicket, not much room to work on it, it hits him on the body and rolls on the wicket, Botha calls for a single and Johnston's football skills won't work for him
SOUTH AFRICA:48.1  Johnston to Duminy, FOUR!!, that's another boundary, Duminy heaves across the line and gets it over square leg, a boundary at the start of the over will put the pressure back on JohnstonTrent Johnston [9.0-0-60-1] is back into the attackThe South Africans have bounced back and 250 is not a bad score on this wicket.

Brace yourselves folks, the match is about to get underway. The clouds are just building up as I type.It is that time of the day when the anthems will be played. There are quite a few supporters for both South Africa and Ireland, good to see people coming from other countries and supporting their home team. The Irishmen have their arms on each others' shoulders while the anthem is being played. The South Africans look very confident, there are a few clouds in the vicinity, hope rain stays away though. This is Ajith, and I will be with you for the first few overs.Teams:Ireland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Kevin O'Brien, Gary Wilson, Niall O'Brien(w), Alex Cusack, John Mooney, Trent Johnston, George Dockrell, Boyd RankinSouth Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Colin Ingram, Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Morne van Wyk(w), Johan Botha, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Morne MorkelSmith: AB de Villiers has some side strain. He is not playing today. That's the only change. We would have bowled first as well, there may be a bit of dew later on. But that gives us a chance to go and get a big hit.Porterfield: We will bowl first, we don't think the wicket is going to change. Johnston comes back in place of Botha. We don't have any pressure on ourselves, this is just a one off game. We need to win this to stay alive in the tournament.Ireland have won the toss and elected to fieldPeterson: The two games that we really wanted to win coming into this tournament was India and England, it was good to win the game against India they way we did. We are prepared, mental preparation is more important, and we are pretty well placed when it comes to that. Our medical staff is pretty good, they are doing a good job and we aren't worried about ABD and Tahir's injuries.Pitch report: There is a bit of grass, there are a few dry areas as well. The seamers won't have much to cheer about. There may be some variable bounce. There may be some rain during tea time and that may be the factor that would determine what the captain winning the toss would like to do feels Ian Botham.Weather update: The weather is expected to be partly cloudy, it is hot and humid right now. The team fielding first has to sweat it out. Slight drizzle expected in the evening.Group B, as it has panned out: Alright, we all know that India defeated Bangladesh, Bangladesh defeated England, England defeated South Africa, South Africa defeated India, India defeated Ireland, and going by this, Can Ireland defeat South Africa to make it a complete circle?Ed Joyce: It was good to contribute with the bat in the previous game. We knew that we would be facing big teams in India, England and South Africa. We could have won 3 out of the 4 games that we played before this. We did well against England but we know that we are the underdogs going into every game. We are confident that if we continue the way we have been playing, we can get another win under our belt.The World Cup finally makes its presence felt at the Eden Gardens, South Africa take on Ireland in a Group B encounter, but don't expect a packed crowd after all the disappointment of the India England game taken away from Kolkata. The Proteas are the favorites, but don't write Ireland out, we know that there are a couple of really good players in their side. Hello and welcome to all you cricket lovers. This is Ajith, I will bring you all the action along with Ganesh, Karthik and Pradeep. Don't go away we'll be back with more updates.The historic Eden Gardens will finally get its dose of World Cup action, after missing out on the India England game, when South Africa take on Ireland. With reports coming in that there haven't been more than 2500 tickets, both teams will be playing in front of a near empty house, but will keen to dish out a match that fans would rue that they've missed it.South AfricaSouth Africa looked every bit the champion team before they choked to defeat against England. The team was suddenly a lot more vulnerable than what seemed on paper. They completed a superb turnaround, losing the chokers tag (for the time being at least) after holding their nerve to clinch a thriller against India.
Their batting line up is in superb form with the likes of Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and Jacques Kallis in good nick. The present form of Graeme Smith looks like a bit of a concern but he has the perfect opportunity to get into his stride. They bat deep with the likes of Johan Botha and Robin Petersen offering some batting options.
The South African bowling attack is looking very lethal, especially after their stunning comeback in the last game. After being carted around the field for most part of the innings, the bowlers lead by Dale Steyn produced a stunning comeback to dismiss the next 9 batsmen for a mere 29 runs. Steyn, showed why he is regarded among the best in the world. Imran Tahir is most likely to return to the line up after missing the India game, and this will add more variety to the line upIrelandIreland have been the most impressive team of the four associate nations having already surprised England and giving the other teams a run for their money. They have failed to give in easily in any of their matches, and South Africa will be wary of the Irish's ability to spring a surprise.
The O' Brien duo has once again proved to be the spine of the Irish batting lineup as they have for sometime now. They have a good mix of batsmen with players who can consolidate and others who can go on the attack when needed. William Porterfield, the captain, has showed his ability to stay long at the crease in the game against India while Stirling and the O' Brien brothers can easily up the ante, especially in power-plays.
Trent Johnston is likely to make a comeback in the game and will provide some much needed potency to the attack with his accurate medium pace. Boyd Rankin has the ability to surprise any batsman with the bounce he extracts from the track using his height while Dockrell too has proved his mettle with 3 big wickets in the game against India.Head to headSouth Africa have played the Irish on 2 occasion, winning both. They have played against each other once at World Cups.Quotes:Corrie Van Zyl: I think it was really a good psychological boost for us, going ahead in this tournament. It was a very important game for us in the tournament and from a psychological point of view. I think defeating India has been good for us, good for our morale."
William Porterfield: If Trent's fit, he plays. He's one of our first picks. He's a massive player for us. He trained today and as long as he has got no reaction to anything then he will be fine.
