This was tossed up and held its line outside off, Duminy was looking to play the reverse sweep, got into an awkward position while doing so, fails to account for the bounce. The ball lobs off the gloves and it's a dolly for Raina at 1st slip. Umpire Kettleborough lifts his finger, Duminy walks off a dejected man. South Africa have lost half their side.

SOUTH AFRICA:30.1 Mohit Sharma to Duminy, 1 run, on a length and around off, worked away in front of square on the on-side for a singleUnfortunately from South Africa's perspective, just when du Plessis and AB de Villiers were playing well, de Villiers was run out on the back of a sharp piece of fielding by Mohit Sharma. Now, that wicket could turn out to be a decisive blow. Du Plessis, then reached his fifty in 65 deliveries, but just in the nick of time, Mohit took his wicket to derail the chase. South Africa's hopes of winning the game now rest on the shoulders of David Miller and JP Duminy. From India's point of view, Ravindra Jadeja, the slow left-arm orthodox, has kept the pressure on the batsmen by bowling an economical spell.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 10 overs: Faf du Plessis showed his ability to use the crease by lofting Ravichandran Ashwin over the infield for a boundary in the 22nd over of the innings. In fact, ever since du Plessis succeeded for Lancashire in List A games in 2008, he has been known for using the depth of the crease while facing up to the spinners.

In fact, after struggling to time the ball, de Villiers captured the hearts of the crowd with a couple of wonderful shots in the 15th over of the game off Mohit's bowling. His partner at the other end, Faf du Plessis, too is playing well.In recent times, India have been severely criticised for banging it short, but the problem with the bowlers was that they weren't getting it head high and outside the off-stump. It also has to be said that it was a good strategy to try the short delivery as a surprise weapon to Amla, as he isn't known for playing the pull shot.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 10 overs: Mohit Sharma followed up Mohammed Shami's fine spell upfront by sending one of the lynchpins of South Africa's batting line-up, Hashim Amla, back to the pavilion. Mohit bowled a fine short delivery that was head high and outside the off-stump to induce Amla to play the pull shot and Shami took a fine catch in the deep.

This was banged in short and just outside off, Amla went for the pull instinctively, doesn't get hold of the shot, gets a thick top-edge. The ball goes high and towards long-leg. Shami was the fielder in the deep, he watches it all along and takes the catch going backwards. He then stops, makes sure that he is well within the ropes and joins in the celebrations.

SOUTH AFRICA:10.1 Mohit Sharma to du Plessis, wide, the bumper from Mohit, but it's a bit too short and too high, called as a wide by the square-leg umpireHere is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 10 overs: Mohammed Shami bowled with unremitting accuracy and was rewarded with the wicket of Quinton de Kock. De Kock looked to tee off for South Africa by attempting to play on the up and through the line, but he was eventually caught by Virat Kohli off Shami's bowling for just seven. It could have been worse for South Africa, as Hashim Amla escaped from getting run out.In fact, Shami also troubled Amla and Faf du Plessis. When Shami bowled, the seam was proud and upright, and he generated swing. India's fielding too has been right on the money. For South Africa, it is up to the experienced duo of Amla and du Plessis to steady the innings by stitching a fine partnership.

Amla had set-off for a quick single, he has to hare back at the striker's end, the shy from Rahane misses the stumps.

SOUTH AFRICA:0.1 U Yadav to Amla, 1 run, Amla is off the mark straightaway, tad fuller and on Amla's pads, tucked away behind square on the on-side for a singleAmla and de Kock are at the crease. Amla is on strike. U Yadav will open the attackUmesh will open the bowling..Welcome back.. India have posted 300 or more for the second successive time. The bowlers had it easy against Pakistan. But South Africa is a different opposition altogether..Jinks: "I really enjoyed batting in the middle. I knew I was batting well, I got a few fifties in the practice games so I just had to continue my momentum. I just took my time initially and later on capitalised. It was important to carry that momentum because Virat and Shikhar was batting really well. I thought when I went in, I had to carry that momentum forward. The wicket was really good and Shikhar was batting really well. I had the confidence in my mind and I just took my chances. I think it's a pretty decent total, big outfields here, I'm sure we will bowl well. First 10 overs will be very crucial for us."It is a true wicket and South Africa still should fancy their chances of chasing down the target. For India, it is up to the bowlers to step up to fashion a victory. It would be interesting to see whether the seamers will get a few deliveries to skid off the surface under lights by bowling cross-seam. On a flat wicket, barring Imran Tahir, none of the South African bowlers were able to stem the run flow. To make it worse for the Proteas, Vernon Philander was troubled by a hamstring problem and could only bowl four overs. Earlier, after India won the toss and elected to bat, the South African pacers started on a good note. Steyn got a good shape away from Rohit Sharma. AB de Villiers, then effected a brilliant direct-hit to run out Rohit. Steyn and Morkel also flicked their wrist to get a few deliveries to climb awkwardly on Dhawan. But Virat Kohli played with composure and Dhawan opened up his shoulders to hit a flurry of boundaries, as India slowly but steadily picked themselves up and turned the screws on South Africa's bowling. Hashim Amla dropping a catch at backward point to give Dhawan a reprieve certainly didn't help their cause.In the 39th over of the innings, he lofted Morkel down the ground for a boundary before slapping him through the cover-region for yet another four. To make it even better, he hoisted Dale Steyn over mid-off for a six in the 46th over. Rahane has also been known for playing horizontal-bat shots and with the South African bowlers testing the middle of the pitch, he used that stroke to collect runs.Ajinkya Rahane, who too essayed a stirring knock, matched Dhawan stroke-for-stroke by playing an innings full of poise and balance. He took a heavy toll off JP Duminy's bowling before smashing the rest of South Africa's attack to shreds.On the back of Shikhar Dhawan's majestic innings of 137, India posted a massive total. However, South Africa took a slew of wickets in the end overs to gain a bit of momentum. Dhawan played with a dash of bravado to flay the famed South African pace attack to all corners of the ground. When South Africa bowled short, he used the pull shot to great effect. He also showcased good footwork by getting his front foot more to the pitch of the ball to essay cover-drives with a royal flourish. In fact, the way he shuffled across to flick a delivery from Morne Morkel over fine-leg for a six gave an indication that he had no time for the reputation of the bowler.4
INDIA:49.6 Steyn to Shami, no run, three dots in a row to end! Length outside off, Shami swings and misses. Should have gone with a straight bat, instead of across the line, de Kock taunts Shami to run. Has a smile and threatens to under-arm the throw back onto the stumps. So India on 307

So nonchalantly done. But that's how Amla is. Never fussed about anything. Dhawan walks off to a standing ovation. Well deserved too. It has been a brilliant, brilliant innings.

INDIA:40.1 M Morkel to Dhawan, 2 runs, on the hips, nudged wide of deep backward square leg, good running gives them a couple44 have come off the batting powerplay. A good one for India. If one casts their mind back to the 2011 WC game, it was the batting powerplay that cost India the game. Tendulkar got out and the rest just imploded. Steyn finished with five that day. Looks like a repeat of that match isn't on the cards.With Rahane too playing a quickfire knock, India are in a position of strength. In particular, Rahane took heavy toll of some poor bowling by JP Duminy to thump him for a couple of boundaries in the 36th over of the innings. He followed it up by lofting Morne Morkel down the ground for a boundary and then slapped him through the cover region. Rahane has played with poise and balance.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 10 overs: Shikhar Dhawan continued to play with a dash of bravado and adventurism to amass his seventh ODI century. It was an innings, where he didn't just play majestic shots, but also showcased good defence while facing up to South Africa's pacers. South African pacers tested Dhawan's technique on the back-foot, but he washed away the challenge with aplomb.

INDIA:30.1 Duminy to Dhawan, 1 run, shortish outside off, punched to deep extra coverJean-Paul Duminy [4.0-0-18-0] is back into the attackDespite the track occasionally offering the pacers variable bounce, it is still a true wicket. As a result, the South African pacers have struggled to get the ball to cut or grip the surface when they have looked to bowl cross-seam. For South Africa, Imran Tahir, with his googly and the quicker one is the one bowler, who has troubled Dhawan. He got the reward for some fine bowling by dismissing Virat Kohli. Steyn though, has struggled to make an impact. In his second spell, he was smashed around and gave away 18 runs in just two overs.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 10 overs: Barring a few moments of alarm, Shikhar Dhawan reprised the fine form that he showed in India's first game against Pakistan and scored a fifty. He twinned good defence with improvisation to put the South African bowlers under pressure. South Africa tested him with short stuff, but Dhawan was up to the challenge. He effortlessly ramped a short delivery from Wayne Parnell over the wicket-keeper before playing a sparkling shot down the ground in the same over. Dhawan followed it up by pulling Dale Steyn for a boundary. Dhawan has certainly played with better footwork in this World Cup and that has helped his cause.

It was hit straight to the fielder, but still had to be taken. Kohli punches the bat in frustration and yells as he knew he had made a mistake, throwing his wicket away after getting in.

INDIA:22.1 Duminy to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli comes down the track and drives to long-onComing back to the no-ball, Aleem Dar may have got it wrong. The heel landed behind and then the foot crossed the line, dragging over. Shouldn't have been called a no-ball
INDIA:21.6 Parnell to Kohli, 1 run, down leg and it's been glanced away to fine leg
INDIA:21.5 Parnell to Kohli, no run, pitched up outside off, Kohli looks for an off-drive, but the ball hits the inside half and runs to mid-on
INDIA:21.4 Parnell to Kohli, 2 runs, caught by Miller at deep mid-wicket, buit it's a free-hit. So it won't count.

INDIA:20.3 Duminy to Kohli, 1 run, Dhawan almost is caught napping! If Duminy had hit, Dhawan was gone. It was punched back to Duminy and Dhawan was backing up, Duminy under-armed and missed the stumps, Dhawan would've been just short. A stroke of luck for DhawanNow goes round the wicket
INDIA:20.2 Duminy to Kohli, no run, tossed up and turning in, Kohli pats with soft hands to short mid-wicket
INDIA:20.1 Duminy to Kohli, no run, Kohli turns it with the spin, straight to the fielder at square legMorkel occasionally extracted variable bounce by hitting back of a length and tested Dhawan's technique on the back-foot. In the 16th over of the innings, he even got one to climb awkwardly from back of a length to hit Dhawan on the left glove. Dhawan gave Morkel a fitting riposte by pulling the next delivery for a four. South Africa didn't help their cause, with Hashim Amla dropping a catch at backward point to give Dhawan a reprieve. To make it worse for them, Vernon Philander is down with a hamstring problem and is off the field for assessment of the injury. Proteas need to break the partnership to pull the batting side back. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 10 overs: Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli farmed the strike superbly to help India gather steady momentum after they lost the wicket of Rohit Sharma. AB de Villiers, South Africa's captain, marshalled his resources well by introducing Imran Tahir and Morne Morkel into the attack. However, Dhawan and Kohli used their feet to Tahir to keep the scoreboard ticking.

INDIA:19.1 Parnell to Dhawan, 1 run, dropped by Amla! Great captaincy by AB, to put a fielder there at backward point. An extra man that is. Dhawan went hard at the cut and hit it in the air, Amla went to his right and got both hands, but it spilled out. The ball was travelling and it was not an easy catch at all. Someone from the team pats Amla on the back after that chance went down

INDIA:16.5 Tahir to Dhawan, no run, Dhawan comes down the track and looks to defend, the ball was very close to the glove, but from the replay it looks like it may have missed it, de Kock and Tahir were celebrating, but Kettleborough made the right call. The review wasn't taken after a discussionde Kock and Tahir are convinced, that Dhawan has edged one onto his pad. They are having a conversation and decide against the review

INDIA:15.2 M Morkel to Dhawan, no run, Dhawan is in all sorts of strife as Morkel delivers a short ball and hits Dhawan on the left glove. Dhawan was looking to duck and was late in doing so, the ball thudded into the glove and went behind him. He didn't know where the ball had gone, as he was shaken by the impact. The body swung back due to the force

Dhawan looks for a dab to third man, the length isn't there to be playing the shot and the inside edge bounces over the stumpsDhawan pulls away at the very last second as Morkel almost completes his action. Must say, that must make the bowler very unhappy. But Morkel takes it well and walks back without any fuss
INDIA:13.4 M Morkel to Kohli, 1 run, that kept low and Kohli did well to crouch low and pull to deep mid-wicket, rolled his wrists and kept it down. That was the cutter from Morkel

INDIA:10.1 Tahir to Kohli, no run, down leg, swept to short fine, inside the ring, Kohli looks for a quick single, sent backImran Tahir, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackAmong the South African pacers, Steyn was impressive. He got a nice shape away from the right-handed Rohit, early on in the innings. He also troubled Dhawan with short stuff. His ability to flick the wrist to get the ball to climb awkwardly on the batsman reminds cricket pundits of former England pacer, John Snow. On the other hand, Vernon Philander extracted subtle seam movement to occasionally trouble the Indian batsmen. With Rohit being dismissed, India need both Dhawan and Virat Kohli to set a solid platform.For India, Dhawan looked in fine touch. Dhawan was getting his front foot more to the pitch of the ball rather than planting it straight down the ground and that helped him to handle the South African pacers reasonably well. The point can be encapsulated by Dhawan getting more to the pitch of the ball to essay a cover-drive off Steyn's bowling in the seventh over of the innings.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 10 overs: South Africa started on a superb note with AB de Villiers running out Rohit Sharma. Rohit slipped at the non striker's end and that cost him his wicket, as de Villiers effected a brilliant direct-hit, with the batsman finding himself short of the crease. The wicket sparked scenes of great celebration in the South African camp

INDIA:7.6 Philander to Dhawan, 1 run, driven wide of short cover's dive and Dhawan beats AB's effort from mid-off, makes the quick single even as AB misses the throw. I guess, Dhawan would've made it anywayNo slips in place. The lone slip has moved to short cover catching
INDIA:7.5 Philander to Dhawan, FOUR, no problems with the timing that time. Hit on-the-up as Dhawan leathers the ball through cover. Right off the middle and time for the Indian flags in the crowd to flutter in the breeze

INDIA:5.1 Philander to Dhawan, 1 run, length on the hips, nudged to deep square legComing back to Rohit's run out, it was Duminy who fumbled at cover but AB was there at mid-off. Rohit should've realised that, but set off thinking it was an easy single.

INDIA:4.3 Steyn to Dhawan, no run, that is a ripper and Dhawan is smiling. Short and Dhawan was late in swaying away from the line of that delivery. Hit on the left forearm protector.

INDIA:4.2 Steyn to Dhawan, no run, another length delivery on middle and leg, Dhawan defends to the left of Steyn
INDIA:4.1 Steyn to Dhawan, no run, short of length on the hips, turned to square legThe reactions from Steyn and AB after Rohit's dismissal said it all. While AB was fist pumping, Steyn punched the air with ferocity. That trademark Steyn celebration, bringing his right hand into play and going hard at thin air.

He knew it as soon as he hit the stumps. Minimal followthrough from AB as he rifled it in. Rohit lost his bat while getting back too. The third ump confirmed Rohit's fears.

The South African team are in a huddle. They break out of it. The Indian openers are out in the middle. Dale Steyn is marking his run. The countdown is over and we are all set to go. The crowd go ballistic. So here is the first ball!Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Wayne Parnell, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirIndia (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit SharmaIndia have won the toss and have opted to batMS Dhoni: "Well what we have done so far is get a couple of practice sessions in the middle, in between every alternate day was off for us. We have been here for a long time, what's important is to keep the guys fresh, but at the same time, whenever we turn up for a practice session we want it to be a high intensity practice session. It's a fantastic ground and the atmosphere is great over here. The capacity is good and when it comes to ODI cricket we have got plenty of fans irrespective of where we play. The stadium is slightly different from Adelaide, the reason being, I think the voices stay inside the stadium. So definitely it's a bit louder. There was more capacity crowd at Adelaide but yes it's a good atmosphere. I felt it was quite a complete performance. The batters batted really well, in these conditions, when you have not lost too many wickets close to the 25th or 26th over, you feel as if you need to go hard. You need to capitalise, so that you get into the powerplay with a few more wickets in hand and then accelerate after that. Looking at the conditions, that's the best bowling attack, unless the wicket is very different. Maybe a Perth wicket, where there is lot more bounce, that's the time, where we will look to change. Other than that we are playing with the same squad"AB de Villiers: "Hell of a exciting. As big a stage as you can get. India is a fantastic cricket team. We are as prepared as we could be. I sure enjoy it, it's a good opportunity for the team to reset and re-strategise again. Spend time away from cricket, which is always important and so very excited to get going again today and break it up again after the game. Probably gonna bat first as well. Not too unhappy though, the bowlers have been in good form of late. We have got a great opportunity here to make some inroads early on and hopefully put them under pressure. So one difficult thing about batting first here, is you don't often known what is gonna be enough on the day. Hopefully we can put them under enough pressure so that they stumble along the way. I don't know really, it's nice to know that you are in a good space as a team and you are in good form. People rate you as a cricket team, so I guess you can take the confidence from that. That comes with a bit of pressure, but look these tournaments are huge pressure tournaments, anyways. You cant' hide from the pressure and the fact that you gonna face some big moments. We are prepared for some big moments again today. For sure, wherever you go there always is big Indian support, for the team, it's great to see. It's great support for cricket here today. I can't imagine the stadium being full, it's not full yet. But we will see in half-an-hour's time or so. Get the juices flowing."Pitch report by Sourav Ganguly and Pommie Mbangwa: There is a fair bit of grass. It will be a lot quicker than what it was when Australia played England. The grass is quite green. The pitch looks hard and there will be pace and bounce through to the keeper. The key according to Mbangwa is to hit a back of a length and use the bounce on offer. There won't be much for the spinners. This is not a 300 pitch. Whichever team which wins the toss will look to bat first as there will be a lot of movement under the lights in the evening.Our man, Raj at the venue has this: "India playing football at the venue. South Africa are limbering up too. Also the Indian team are having their fielding practice in two groups"So that will be a wrap of the pre-match build-up. Now our focus will be on the game.

Get going then as there is still time for the toss and the team news to happen.Today's encounter takes place at the 'G' one of the iconic venues in modern sport. Want to know more about the ground then head here - click on the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 section on the homepage and then click on more>>Venues. Lots of interesting and fascinating facts about the ground in there. You don't want to miss out on such a treasure trove of information.Virat Kohli: "A win against a team like South Africa will strengthen our immense self-belief that we can beat big sides in the knockout stages as well."Some quotes as we continue our build-up to the game. Here is AB de Villiers: "I have enjoyed busy, intense games. It should get the blood flowing, playing in front of the big crowd in a big stadium with great tradition and history. We always love playing in big games, so nothing will change. We're just looking forward to playing some good cricket on Sunday."What is the weather forecast for Sunday? There was a light shower in Melbourne on Saturday but the weather is expected to be clear with a high in the mid-thirties predicted.South Africa: AB de Villiers has backed Imran Tahir, calling him a match-winner and also ruled out the possibility of playing an all-seam attack. So expect South Africa to play the same team that won against Zimbabwe.Pre-match team news, India: After such a convincing win against Pakistan, India would in all likelihood go in with the same side from that game. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is still unfit, while it looks unlikely that Stuart Binny will get a game despite him having a heavy training session on Friday."In every series we have played, there has been a subtle mention of the World Cup in a few months' time and we tried to put ourselves under pressure in every game we have played, whether in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, or Dubai."This is very interesting from South Africa coach Russell Domingo, who revealed that the team had approached a dead rubber against Pakistan in Sharjah a year and a half ago as if it were a must-win World Cup quarterfinal to be able to deal with the pressure of such a big game. "There has always been a subtle mention of it being a World Cup knockout match," he said."The South African pace attack is similar to that of Australia, and more potent than Pakistan. Having seen the pace, bounce and swing during Australia's defeat of England a few days ago, I believe that South African pacers will be able to put the Indian batting line-up under pressure and utilise the new ball with a couple of early wickets. India's task is really cut out," said the 45-year-old Jonty.Former South African great Jonty Rhodes feels that the Indian batsmen will struggle against South Africa's quicks at the 'G'. "Much as I see India putting up an improved performance over the past few months in Australia, fresh from their rejuvenating win against Pakistan, I foresee a South African win with their strong batting, lethal bowling and an all-round fielding side led by mercurial AB de Villiers," Rhodes told PTI.AB de Villiers too reckons Ashwin is a dangerous bowler, but refused to admit that his side will have a problem dealing with him. We covered all their players, batters and bowlers. Ashwin is a wonderful bowler. They've got other match winners as well. We've played spin really well over the last few years. It's definitely not a weakness of our team," de Villiers said.Ahead of the game, one man who is turning out to be the centre of much discussion is Indian offie R Ashwin. Kohli praised Ashwin's role in India's win against Pakistan at Adelaide last week. "I was really happy to see the way he bowled in that first game. He's at his best when he wants to take wickets and he was really aggressive. It's more of a mental battle going on the field and I think he was on top most of the time when he bowled," he said."Once you get hold of the momentum, like we did beautifully in the 2011 World Cup, you can see the team looks like a unit when you see it on the field. There's not an extra effort to prove that to people, but it just is conveyed through watching the game."Virat Kohli the Indian vice-captain is banking his team to build a 'beautiful momentum' just as the Class of 2011 had done in winning the ICC Cricket World Cup. "We got the momentum in the first game and want to carry it forward," he said, his own 107 against Pakistan at Adelaide sparking that. "Yes, we are looking to hold onto that.""Every game we play, we want to win. I can't tell you now because I don't know what's going to happen the next four games we play. Maybe it's a make or break for us, maybe not, but all I know is that we want to win the game. We've prepared in order for us to win this game, and we're as ready as we can be. We're just going to go out there and give it our best shot tomorrow.""It's a World Cup. You're playing for your country, representing South Africa, and they're obviously representing India. Both nations are very proud cricketing nations, so it's a matter of really putting it out there on the field and leaving everything out there on the field in order for you to win the game. Friendships are not going to play a role tomorrow. That's for sure," de Villiers said on the eve of the match on Saturday.Now moving on and what is all the news ahead of the big clash. First up AB de Villiers wants to keep "friendship" aside ahead of India game. Everyone are aware that de Villiers has a lot of friends in the Indian team. He is a team-mate of Virat Kohli at Royal Challengers but the Proteas captain believes the World Cup is the stage to be fierce, not friendly.Zimbabwe started well with the bat too and were well on course at 214/3 after 36 overs with Brendan Taylor and Sean Williams at the crease. The platform was set by Chibhabha and Masakadaza's fifties and it needed a good partnership down the order to keep up with the pace. But Morkel dismissed Brendan Taylor and that sparked a collapse. All the bowlers shared the wickets as South Africa bowled out Zimbabwe for 277, winning the game by 62 runs.South Africa's clash with Zimbabwe: It was all Zimbabwe as they got four quick wickets to leave their neighbors at 83/4. Enter David Miller and JP Duminy who then sent the Zimbabweans on a leather hunt. The duo put on an unbroken stand of 256 as they registered hundreds against their name. Miller made 138 with nine sixes while Duminy finished with 115 and three sixes. Both scored their runs at well over run-a-ball as South Africa ended on 339.Pakistan lost Younis Khan early in the chase, but were going smoothly when Shehzad and Haris Sohail were batting. But a collapse saw them behind the eight-ball and it was left to Misbah to wage a lone battle. He made 76 but none of his partners were willing to stay with him. Eventually they lost the game by 76 runs to extend their winless run against India. For India, Mohammad Shami took 4 wickets and stood out amongst the bowlers.What happened when India met Pakistan? The pressure was on Pakistan coming into the big clash. India won the toss and batted first and were helped by Dhawan and Kohli's partnership. Dhawan looked good for a hundred before he was run out for 73. Kohli though promptly made it three consecutive tons at the Adelaide Oval since he set foot in Australia last year. Raina's 56-ball 74 took India to exactly 300. Sohail Khan the bustling seamer finished with a five-for.So that's the flashback done of their three previous meetings. Now let's concentrate on what happened in this tournament when South Africa and India played their opening games. Let's begin with India.India were left to rue their collapse in the batting powerplay when they went from 267 for 1, in the 40th over, to be bowled out for 296. Later, Dhoni had strong words about that collapse: "You don't play for the crowd, you play for the country."Chasing 300, South Africa were guided by fifties from Amla, Kallis and de Villiers. But regular wickets at the end meant that they needed 13 off the final over. MS Dhoni went for Ashish Nehra despite Harbhajan having one over left. Harbhajan had given just five in his previous over and was the favorite. South Africa had Robin Peterson and Dale Steyn at the crease and the former finished off the game with 4, 6, 2 and 4 off the first four balls.India started off well with Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag putting on 142 in 18 overs. The platform was set for a huge total, but the batting powerplay proved to be catastrophic for the Indians. India were well placed at 253 for 1 but lost four wickets for 30 runs in the Powerplay and their last nine for 29 to collapse to 296. Sachin made a superb 111 while Dale Steyn who had been expensive initially finished with a five-for.2011 World Cup: South Africa won by 3 wickets. Man of the Match - Dale SteynComing to the match, India made 253 on a chilly day at Hove. Sourav Ganguly made a brilliant 97 before he was run out. Dravid chipped in with a fifty. The target wasn't enough for a strong South African batting line-up who coasted home with 16 balls to spare. They were in trouble at 68/3 but Jacques Kallis showed his class with 96. The others gave him company with Rhodes and Klusener finishing off things."We probably should have asked permission from the ICC. I suppose it was a little naive of me not to do that. All it is is a two-way radio which allows me to talk to the players. All we're trying to do is give the players advice and help them more quickly rather than send on someone with gloves or whatever to pass on the same information."South Africa moved swiftly in an attempt to defuse the row and coach Woolmer said: "If I have upset anyone, then I apologise. I was just trying to be innovative."It said: "The World Cup is not the event to experiment with new devices without first seeking permission from the ICC."The International Cricket Council was outraged by the episode and made its views clear to South Africa in a terse statement.This game was famous for the piece of innovation that South Africa's captain and coach tried to introduce to the cricketing world. Hansie Cronje and Allan Donald were wired up to coach Bob Woolmer, who sat in the dressing-room dispensing advice. South Africa were experimenting with a one-way radio system. When Cronje was spotted talking to the coach, match referee, Talat Ali promptly pulled the plug on the invention. The ICC later ruled out any such instances happening for the rest of the World Cup.1999 World Cup: South Africa won by 4 wickets. Man of the Match - Jacques Kallis.The target was stiff with South Africa needing more than 6rpo but they made light work of the chase with Peter Kirsten - brother of Gary - starring with 84. He put on a opening stand of 128 with Andrew Hudson and put the game out of India's reach. There was a slight wobble when four quick wickets fell, but the Proteas won with five balls to spare.In a game reduced to 30-overs per side due to rain, it was South Africa who came out on top. Batting first India made 180 for 6 with Mohammad Azharuddin making a 77-ball 79. Kapil Dev provided the late fireworks as he hit 42 off 29 balls with three fours and a six.1992 World Cup: South Africa won by 6 wickets. Man of the Match - Peter Kirsten.So will the jinx be finally broken today? Howdy folks! A warm welcome wherever you may be as we start our coverage of this big match. Before we head any further, we'll have a look back at India's three past meetings with South Africa. Starting with the clash in 1992.So that's that then! Pakistan have a 0-6 record against India in World Cups. The Pakistani fan is a frustrated man, still waiting for a win. While the South African fans are happy. You want to know the reason? Then here is the answer - India have never beaten South Africa in a World Cup. Never! They have played them three times and have lost all three.Wondering what I'm going on about? Then you need to know the context behind the ad. For the India-Pakistan game, the official broadcasters had an ad where a Pakistani fan waits and waits - with crackers waiting to be burst - for his side's win over India in World Cups. His wait starts from his teenage years and still it continues as he gets married and has a son. His frustrated son asks him when can they burst the crackers as he keeps the box safely in the house.12:30 Local Time, 01:30 GMT, 07:00 IST: In one of the ads being broadcast by the official broadcasters, a group of Indian fans are intently watching a game on television, only for the doorbell to ring. No-one is willing to open the door, but finally one is forced to. When the door is opened, two South African fans stand there with crackers in hand. They handover the box of crackers to the perplexed Indian fan and start singing mauka, mauka in Hindi which translates to chance in English.Preview by G RajaramanThe vast, empty and silent terraces of the Melbourne Cricket Ground lay in anticipation on Saturday for Sunday's ICC Cricket World Cup Group B game between India and South Africa to electrify the vast hordes of fans enjoying a battle royale on what looks like a bald, hard pitch.A fortnight ago, any optimism around Sunday's match being a competitive battle would have been looked at with disdain. But the emphatic manner in which India secured victory over Pakistan in Adelaide as well as South Africa's less than convincing show against Zimbabwe in Hamilton last week have combined to heighten expectations of a keen battle.Some amazing friendships struck on the international circuit and in the much-maligned IPL notably MS Dhoni's association with Faf du Plessis and Virat Kohli's bonding with AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn will be set aside on Sunday when the teams step on the field, wearing their respective colours and singing their own national anthems.There can be no doubt that South Africa are the better side on paper, with a series of explosive batsmen like de Villiers, du Plessis, David Miller, JP Duminy and Quinton de Kock to make the most of Hashim Amla's anchoring approach, a quality bowling line-up that can test the best of teams and an eagerness to make this World Cup their own.Bowling Coach Allan Donald had indicated that South Africa will treat this as a home game for India, considering that Dhoni's team will secure massive crowd support. It led to some talk about how some of South Africa players do not have the experience of playing before large crowds.However, de Villiers pointed out he has always enjoyed big crowds. "I have enjoyed busy, intense games. It should get the blood flowing, playing in front of the big crowd in a big stadium with great tradition and history. We always love playing in big games, so nothing will change. We're just looking forward to playing some good cricket on Sunday," de Villiers said.On the contrary, it will help India if they go into the match believing that they are playing a knockout game rather than only their second fixture in the league stage. A huge effort here can not only help them in their bid to take top spot in the pool but also ensure that they maintain the momentum from the big victory over Pakistan last week.Virat Kohli, who fronted for the team at the media briefing on Saturday, said it was important for the side to hold momentum in a tournament like the World Cup. "A win against a team like South Africa will strengthen our immense self-belief that we can beat big sides in the knockout stages as well," he said.South Africa may bring left-arm paceman Wayne Parnell in place of Farhaan Behardein or Vernon Philander, who is battling to regain fitness from a stiff hamstring. India will most likely retain the XI against Pakistan. The vast terraces will neither be empty nor silent on Sunday afternoon when the teams roll out a heady contest.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Rilee Rossouw, Aaron Phangiso, Kyle AbbottIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(c/w), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Axar Patel, Stuart Binny, Ambati RayuduLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
