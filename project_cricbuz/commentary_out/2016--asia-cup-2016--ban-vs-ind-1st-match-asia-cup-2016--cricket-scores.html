BANGLADESH:16.3 Nehra to Mahmudullah, out Caught by Rohit!! India inch closer. Mahmudullah perishes trying to keep up with the asking rate. It was a full toss and deserved to be put into the stands, but instead Nehra has a wicket. Mahmudullah got his front leg out of way to get a free swing of the arms, doesn't get it anywhere close to the middle and Rohit was a bit lazy taking the catch. He could have come forward and taken it easily, but prefers to stay back and take a low catch. Mahmudullah c Rohit b Nehra 7(6) [4s-1]Nehra to Mahmudullah, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

India are running away with the game. S Rahman c Dhoni b Pandya 44(32) [4s-2 6s-2]Pandya to S Rahman, THAT'S OUT!!

BANGLADESH:12.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Shakib, out Shakib Run Out!! Huge moment in the game. The crowd are stunned. Shakib is livid at his partner. Gives him a mouthful before trudging off. Flatter and close to off, worked away to the left of mid-wicket, he set off and Rahman also took a couple of steps before saying "no", Shakib slipped while turning back and it was all too easy for the Indians.

BANGLADESH:11.4 Ashwin to S Rahman, SIX, fantastic shot! They have started to get a move on. Straightaway holds his right hamstring. Bit of air on this one and Rahman is quick to dance down and carve it over deep mid-wicket, the fielder was a mere spectator

BANGLADESH:10.5 Pandya to Shakib, wide, almost dug it in near his shoelaces, went way over Shakib, who just saw the ball sail through. Dhoni had to leap up to collect it with one hand. That won't do any good for the skipper's back which is already strapped
BANGLADESH:10.4 Pandya to S Rahman, 1 run, tries to be too cheeky. Moves across his stumps to play the scoop over short fine, gets an inside edge onto the thigh pad and the ball trickles away to short fine leg
BANGLADESH:10.3 Pandya to S Rahman, SIX, well, well, well. So many resemblence to the Indian innings. Rohit was given a life before he started to take on the bowling. Rahman survived one at the start of the over. Is this the turn of events? Rahman was waiting for the ball to be short, pulled it nonchalantly over the deep mid-wicket fence for the first maximum of the innings
BANGLADESH:10.2 Pandya to Shakib, 1 run, on a length and just outside off, Shakib opens the bat face and taps it square on the off-side
BANGLADESH:10.1 Pandya to S Rahman, 1 run, that will go down as a chance. It was a back of a length delivery around off, Rahman flat-batted it to the left of Pandya, who expected the ball to come faster than it did, doesn't even get a fingertip on itAgain there is nothing to choose between the two teams. After 10 overs, India - 52/3 and Bangladesh - 51/3. Can Sabbir Rahman be the Rohit Sharma for Bangladesh? How will Shakib go about? Let's wait and watch..
BANGLADESH:9.6 Ashwin to S Rahman, 1 run, once again the ball drifts away from the right-hander, Rahman waits and nurdles it in front of square on the leg-sideShakib Al Hasan, left handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:9.5 Ashwin to Kayes, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Well, it had to happen. The cuts and nudges were not working for Kayes. So what does he do? Decides to bring out the sweep, Ashwin is a smart operator, dishes out an offie that bounces more than the batsman expected, the top-edge is found and the ball carries to deep backward square, Yuvi runs to his left, reverse-cups it as he goes to ground. Well judged catch that. Kayes c Yuvraj b Ashwin 14(24) [4s-1]Ashwin to Kayes, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

BANGLADESH:9.1 Ashwin to Kayes, 1 run, sliding on with the angle, Kayes waits and milks a single to deep mid-wicketRahman was struggling with something and the physio was out attending to him. He looks fine as he has decided to continue...
BANGLADESH:8.6 Pandya to S Rahman, 2 runs, pitched up on driveable length, Rahman plays it uppishly through extra cover, sweeper had a few yards to cover to his right and the pair come back for the second
BANGLADESH:8.5 Pandya to S Rahman, no run, that is an ugly shot. Good length ball outside off, Rahman shuffles across and tries to slog it towards cow corner. His eyes and head were not in sync to play that shot. Looked ugly to say the least
BANGLADESH:8.5 Pandya to S Rahman, wide, bouncer which is too high for the batsman, Rahman has nothing to do with it, easy call for the umpire
BANGLADESH:8.4 Pandya to Kayes, 1 run, Kayes is riding his luck. Once again in the air and right in between the two fielders. Went for the lofted-drive and got it on the splice, the ball was in the air for some time, dropped between Kohli and Yuvraj, who ran in from cover and mid-off respectively
BANGLADESH:8.3 Pandya to Kayes, no run, angled across the left-hander, Kayes goes fishing at it and fortunately for him the outside edge is not found

BANGLADESH:7.5 Ashwin to Kayes, no run, wow! The drifter, pitched and came in, Kayes was shaping to play the cut, didn't expect the ball to deviate so much, is beaten comprehensively. Ashwin blows a puff of air, he knows he was close
BANGLADESH:7.4 Ashwin to Kayes, no run, goes on with the angle from round the wicket, Kayes is early into the nudge, misses it completely and is struck on the back pad, no appeal for LBW as the ball was sliding down leg
BANGLADESH:7.3 Ashwin to S Rahman, 1 run, Ashwin sticks to round the wicket, tossed up on middle and leg, worked away to mid-wicket
BANGLADESH:7.2 Ashwin to S Rahman, no run, slower and on the stumps, Rahman defends with the bat in front of his pad
BANGLADESH:7.1 Ashwin to S Rahman, FOUR, that is some way to welcome a bowler, Rahman premeditated the reverse sweep, Ashwin makes his job easier by dishing out a full toss, middled it beautifully and it raced away to the deep backward point fenceRavichandran Ashwin, right-arm off break, comes into the attackSpin for the first time and this should be interesting. There was dew when Bangladesh bowled, how will Ashwin and Jaddu cope with it?
BANGLADESH:6.6 Pandya to Kayes, no run, clever from Pandya, sees the batsman advance and bangs it halfway down, Kayes had to take the safer option, ducks and gets away from the line of the delivery
BANGLADESH:6.5 Pandya to S Rahman, leg byes, 1 run, Rahman misses out on a boundary scoring opportunity. Bit of wood and that would have been a boundary. Drifting onto the hips, Rahman gets inside the line and fails to lay bat on the glance, ball thuds into the thigh pad and rolls fine

BANGLADESH:6.2 Pandya to Kayes, 1 run, Pandya decides to test the bounce on the wicket, digs it short and gets it to rear up, Kayes had enough time though, to get into position and play a controlled pull to fine leg
BANGLADESH:6.1 Pandya to S Rahman, 1 run, short of length on off, Rahman dabs it in front of backward point, quick single takenHardik Pandya, right-arm medium, comes into the attackIndia after the powerplay - 31/2. Bangladesh after the powerplay - 31/2. No difference between the two sides. Who is going to be the Rohit Sharma for the home side?
BANGLADESH:5.6 Bumrah to Kayes, no run, finally, manages to connect with a pull, but almost holed out to square leg. Fraction short and on off, Kayes swivels and mistimes the pull to Raina, went on the bounce
BANGLADESH:5.5 Bumrah to Kayes, no run, Kayes keeps targeting the cow corner region and keeps failing to connect. Once again the length was not short enough to attempt the pull, misses and is struck on the back thighBack round the wicket for Kayes...
BANGLADESH:5.4 Bumrah to S Rahman, 1 run, full and touch too straight, on middle stump, Rahman leans into the flick, rolls his wrist and hits it along the ground to deep square leg
BANGLADESH:5.3 Bumrah to S Rahman, 2 runs, sharp short delivery, Rahman is hurried into the pull and the top-edge is found, luckily for the batsman it hits his shoulder and flies away towards third man where Nehra runs across, goes down in installments and saves a couple of runs. Have to give for effort though
BANGLADESH:5.2 Bumrah to S Rahman, no run, back of a length in and around off, Rahman camps back and defends it with the straight bat, ball deflects off the pad towards cover
BANGLADESH:5.1 Bumrah to Kayes, 1 run, switches to round the wicket, the length is on the shorter side, Kayes tucks it to the right of square leg, Yuvi dives to his left and parries it to mid-on, can't prevent the single
BANGLADESH:4.6 Nehra to Kayes, 1 run, mix-up between the batsmen, but no harm done. Kayes wrists the length delivery in front of mid-on and sets off, Rahman wasn't sure whether to go for the run or not, in the end he responds and Dhawan has a shy at the wrong end - bowler's end. A throw to the striker's end would have been a better option
BANGLADESH:4.5 Nehra to S Rahman, 1 run, Rahman decides to give the charge and Nehra is experienced enough to counter that, drags the length back and cramps the batsman for room, mistimes the pull towards mid-on
BANGLADESH:4.4 Nehra to Kayes, 1 run, back of a length around off, Kayes pushes it wide of cover
BANGLADESH:4.3 Nehra to Kayes, no run, Nehra gets away with this one. Strays one onto the pads, Kayes falls over on the flick and fails to connect, is rapped on the pads and the ball rolls to the on-side, Nehra races across and prevents the leg-bye
BANGLADESH:4.2 Nehra to S Rahman, 1 run, just short! It was nothing but a good length delivery angled across Rahman, who uses an horizontal bat to guide it to third man, there was a gully in place and it fell just in front of Raina, who got a hand and made a half-stop
BANGLADESH:4.1 Nehra to S Rahman, FOUR, lovely shot! Rahman picked the bones out of that. Short and Rahman was waiting for it, rocks back and muscles the pull over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and into the fence
BANGLADESH:3.6 Bumrah to Kayes, no run, short of length around off, Kayes gets behind the line and blocks it to the right of the bowlerDhoni and his field placements. There were two slips and a gully before this ball and now he brings in a fly slip, right between second slip and gully...
BANGLADESH:3.5 Bumrah to Kayes, FOUR, a much better option this. Pitched up and in the driving arc, Kayes doesn't bother to move his feet, reaches the ball using his long handle and lofts it over extra cover, no need to run for those as the ball sped away to the fence
BANGLADESH:3.4 Bumrah to Kayes, no run, you can't play that shot when a bowler is slanting it across you. Good length ball outside off, Kayes goes for the pull and misses. The length nor the line was not there to play that shot
BANGLADESH:3.3 Bumrah to Kayes, no run, appeal for lbw from behind the wicket, but nothing from Bumrah. This one might have just held its line, Kayes prods forward to defend, ekes out an inside edge onto the back pad. That saved him there. Could have so easily been the third wicketImrul Kayes, left handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:3.2 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, out Caught by Dhoni!! Bumrah gets his first. Bangladesh are struggling against the new ball. Not the start they would have wanted. This one bounced a bit more than the batsman anticipated. It was short of length alright, Sarkar was hanging back to defend, doesn't account for the bounce, the ball brushes the glove and settles neatly in Dhoni's mitts. Soumya Sarkar c Dhoni b Bumrah 11(14) [4s-1]Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
BANGLADESH:3.1 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, no run, fullish and around off, Sarkar steps out while giving himself room, can't get hold of the drive, drills it straight to mid-off
BANGLADESH:2.6 Nehra to S Rahman, 2 runs, Pandya misjudged that one. Banged in halfway down, Rahman didn't have the room to play the pull, mistimes it towards mid-on. Pandya kept waiting for some reason instead of going back straightaway, the ball just eludes him and Nehra is not pleased. Throws his cap after the umpire hands it over to him
BANGLADESH:2.5 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, 3 runs, Ashwin slipped and the duo sneaked in an extra run. Fullish and just outside off, Sarkar moves forward, opens the bat face and glides it behind point. Ashwin runs to his left from third man, slips while trying to slide and that allows the batsmen to take the third
BANGLADESH:2.4 Nehra to S Rahman, 1 run, drags the length back and angles it across the right-hander, Rahman opens the bat face and steers it to third man
BANGLADESH:2.3 Nehra to S Rahman, no run, one, two, three and four appeals for a catch. Nehra was convinced and kept going even though the umpire had shaken his head in disapproval. Another nip-backer from short of length, Rahman is rooted to the crease and is beaten on the inside edge, ball goes off the back thigh to first slip. Nehra thought there was some wood, but the replays showed otherwiseSabbir Rahman, right handed bat, comes to the crease
BANGLADESH:2.2 Nehra to Mithun, out Bowled!! Nehra draws first blood for India. This was always on the cards. The runs were not coming freely, the batsman tries to do something out of the ordinary and pays the price. It was a good length delivery that nipped back in slightly, Mithun went for the swipe across the line, missed it completely and the off-stump takes a beating. Nehra is delighted. Pumps his fists in joy. Mithun b Nehra 1(3)Nehra to Mithun, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
BANGLADESH:2.1 Nehra to Mithun, no run, tails back in from short of length, Mithun is cramped for room, he was attempting a steer to third man, doesn't account for the swing, wears it on the back thigh and the ball goes on the bounce to Dhoni, who dives to his right and makes a half-stop
BANGLADESH:1.6 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, no run, might have been the off-speed delivery from Bumrah as it went on the bounce to Dhoni. Sarkar has a waft at that, didn't go full-throttle and the ball almost kissed the outside edge. Good comeback after being hit for a boundary off the first ball
BANGLADESH:1.5 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, no run, and again. Sarkar is beaten for the Nth time in this innings. The widish angle and the late movement from Bumrah are causing problems for Sarkar, he follows the path of the ball and is beaten on the outside edge
BANGLADESH:1.4 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, no run, now we see some swing for Bumrah. And why is that? Because he pitched the ball up and lured the batsman forward, Sarkar went for a loose drive and is beaten
BANGLADESH:1.3 Bumrah to Mithun, 1 run, another hurried single. Hint of inward movement, the length was on the shorter side and that allowed Mithun to adjust, stands in the crease and dabs it towards backward pointBumrah too has two slips in place..
BANGLADESH:1.2 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, 1 run, sensible batting. Short of a length and around off, Sarkar drops it with soft hands in front of point and sets off, easily done in the end
BANGLADESH:1.1 Bumrah to Soumya Sarkar, FOUR, there he goes. The length and line was in his zone and Sarkar has no half measures. Short and width offered outside off, Sarkar stands on his toes and slaps it over cover, just evaded the leaping fielder. Bumrah thought he was in with a chance, but that was hit hardJasprit Bumrah, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
BANGLADESH:0.6 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, 3 runs, the smile is wiped off Nehra's face thanks to Bumrah. Slides one onto the hips, Sarkar tucks it behind square on the leg-side, there was two on offer, but Bumrah was a bit casual in getting to the ball and the batsmen pushed back for the third. Nehra was not happy with that effort
BANGLADESH:0.5 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, no run, another jaffa. Nehra still has a smile on his face. Shortens the length and gets it to zoom off the surface, no idea as to what Sarkar was trying there, stood tall and had a woosh at the ball across the line. Beaten!
BANGLADESH:0.4 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, no run, beauty! He is squared up and Nehra has a wry smile on his face. Good length ball and jags away from the left-hander, Sarkar goes feeling for it, once again away from the body and is beaten neck and crop
BANGLADESH:0.3 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, no run, much better. Pitches it up and gets it to curl away, Sarkar's feet was stuck in cement as he flirted with it away from the body, there was a daylight gap between bat and ball
BANGLADESH:0.2 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, no run, ambitious! A back of a length delivery in and around off, Sarkar went for the pull, the ball didn't bounce as much as he expected and it went underneath the bat
BANGLADESH:0.1 Nehra to Soumya Sarkar, no run, starts with a shortish delivery on the fourth stump line, Sarkar stands tall and drops it dead on the off-side. You won't get much swing with that length, need to pitch it upSoumya Sarkar and Mithun are at the crease. Soumya Sarkar is on strike. Nehra will open the attackHello again... The openers are out in the middle. Soumya Sarkar and Mohammad Mithun are in the centre, no Imrul Kayes. Ashish Nehra to open the attack. He has a couple of slips in place. Can he make use of the surface? We'll know soon as he steams in for the first ball...The pitch is unusually green by Bangladeshi standards and India would have liked to have one extra seamer in the final XI. Nonetheless, this presents Hardik Pandya with an opportunity to prove his worth as the third medium-pacer in the team. After his carnage with the bat, he would be itching to have a go with the ball as well. From Bangladesh's perspective, they were in the game for the first 13 overs, courtesy their pacers. However, the momentum shifted India's way after the late surge. Though the hosts did well in the last two overs to prevent India from crossing the 170-mark. Mortaza's men would be hoping that the dew comes to their rescue, else it might turn out to be a difficult one for them to scale. Join us for the chase in a few minutes.A green track to the Indian batsmen is what Kryptonite is to Superman. Once again the famed batting line-up, especially the top order, was exposed on a surface which had a fair covering of grass. Just a few weeks ago, they had faced similar troubles against a rookie Sri Lankan attack in Pune and today the talented Bangladesh pace battery rankled old wounds. If it was not for Rohit Sharma, whose form continues to prosper, India would have found it really difficult to reach where they ultimately did. Rohit was cautious at the start of the innings, was dropped on 21 by Shakib Al Hasan and made full use of the lifeline to steer the ship to safety.1
INDIA:19.6 Al-Amin to Dhoni, SIX, a chance for me to once again say, "Dhoni finishes off in style." Short of a length slower delivery from Al-Amin, sat up nicely for Dhoni, who swivelled and muscled the pull shot way back over the backward square leg boundary
INDIA:19.5 Al-Amin to Dhoni, 2 runs, this is good fielder placing from Mortaza. Mid-off is very straight, almost behind the bowler and he saved a certain boundary. Full delivery outside off stump, Dhoni drives straight down the ground, Taskin dives to his right and half-stops the ball, can't prevent the second run thoughRavindra Jadeja, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:19.4 Al-Amin to Pandya, out Caught by Mahmudullah!! That is the end of a fine cameo from Hardik Pandya. Full and angled in, Pandya tries to loft it over the rope, but doesn't get the distance and holes out to long-on. Pandya punches his glove with the incoming batsman. The good thing for India is that Dhoni has crossed over and he will be on strike for the next ball. Pandya c Mahmudullah b Al-Amin 31(18) [4s-4 6s-1]Al-Amin to Pandya, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:19.3 Al-Amin to Pandya, no run, beaten, through the legs. Good length delivery angled in, Pandya swings across the line, misses and they can't take a bye as well. Pandya wanted a run, but his skipper sent him back. Surely a run was not on. Dhoni knows that he will have to wait for his chanceMS Dhoni, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:19.2 Al-Amin to Rohit, out Caught by Soumya Sarkar!! Now that is a stunning catch in the deep. Needed some brilliance to remove Rohit Sharma and Soumya Sarkar has taken a blinder. Rohit slowly drags himself off the field after an excellent innings. Al-Amin bangs the slower ball short, Rohit sits back and plays the pull, hits it flat, the man at deep mid-wicket runs to his left, dives low and takes it with both hands. This is a key wicket for Bangladesh at this stage, for Rohit was threatening to go big. Rohit c Soumya Sarkar b Al-Amin 83(55) [4s-7 6s-3]Al-Amin to Rohit, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:19.1 Al-Amin to Pandya, 1 run, full and in the slot, Pandya would have backed himself to clear the rope, but he only manages to hit this hard and on the bounce to long-onGood over in the context of the game. Just 8 off it!
INDIA:18.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, byes, 1 run, full and wide outside off stump, Pandya tries to slice it with one hand through backward point but fails to make contact, Rohit steals a bye though
INDIA:18.5 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, 2 runs, full delivery outside off stump, Pandya clears his front leg out of the way and drills the drive to long-off, once again good running gives them two
INDIA:18.4 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, no run, beaten and Pandya is furious with himself. Calm down youngman calm down. Oh he's shaking his head now. Good to see Rohit walk down the pitch and have a word with Pandya. Good length delivery outside off stump, Pandya slogs and misses, he lost his shape as he went so hard at it, hence no connection
INDIA:18.3 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, no run, good call from the umpire. Pandya was backing away and he failed to reach out to this full ball wide outside off stump, it was just inside the line and rightly not called a wide
INDIA:18.2 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, FOUR, has he cleared the rope? Just short! Almost a maximum. Lovely use of the crease. He knows that Mustafizur Rahman is going to angle it across him, so he opens himself up while also going deep in the crease, he carves this with hard hands and it flies over backward point. Pandya moves on to 28 off 11 balls
INDIA:18.1 Mustafizur Rahman to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit under-edges the pull along the ground to deep mid-wicketThe last three overs have been very fruitful for the Indians. 51 runs have been scored. 2 more overs left. It is currently 149/4. Can they get to 170-175?
INDIA:17.6 Al-Amin to Pandya, 2 runs, slower delivery on the stumps, Pandya rocks back and mistimes the pull to deep mid-wicket, pushes Rohit for the second his senior partner had to put in the full length dive to make his ground. Anyway, the stumps were not broken
INDIA:17.5 Al-Amin to Pandya, no run, the slower ball bouncer from Al-Amin, Pandya tries to ramp it past the keeper but fails to make contact
INDIA:17.4 Al-Amin to Pandya, FOUR, he's batting ahead of Dhoni and he's justifying that move. Full toss from Al-Amin, Pandya flicks with a strong bottom hand grip and deep mid-wicket was a mere spectator as it rocketed past him to his right
INDIA:17.3 Al-Amin to Pandya, FOUR, this is carved away nicely. Fullish in length from Al-Amin, Pandya slices it hard through cover-point, there was a man in the deep but he had no chance. This is a great cameo from Pandya
INDIA:17.2 Al-Amin to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit opens the face of the bat and tries to guide it fine, but picks out short third man
INDIA:17.1 Al-Amin to Rohit, 2 runs, full and in the slot, Rohit drives it to deep extra-coverAl-Amin Hossain [2.0-0-15-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:16.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, SIX, in the slot and that's muscled. Pandya is known for his big hitting. Pandya waits for the ball to come and plays a wristy slog, the timing was very good and it easily cleared the mid-wicket boundary
INDIA:16.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, wide, short and down the leg-side, easy call for the umpire
INDIA:16.5 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, 2 runs, outside edge, but it lands in front of third man and the fielder almost fumbles the ball. He didn't cover for the turn there. It went further away from him, but it was slow enough for him to recover. Fullish and outside off stump, Pandya went hard at it, got an edge and got away with it
INDIA:16.4 Mustafizur Rahman to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit flicks this towards mid-on
INDIA:16.3 Mustafizur Rahman to Rohit, SIX, it's up in the air, who wants it? There is a fielder there, Shakib it is again, and he's tipped this over the bar. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, actually a slower ball, but Rohit has such good hands that he managed to time that flick so well despite the lack of pace on the ball, Shakib at deep backward square leg was very close to the rope, in fact, his feet were touching the rope when he attempted that catch and would have been six anyway even if he had caught it
INDIA:16.2 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, 1 run, Pandya tries to work it on the on-side, gets a leading edge that rolls to mid-off
INDIA:16.1 Mustafizur Rahman to Pandya, FOUR, now that is sliced nicely by Pandya. Good length delivery angled across, Pandya was slightly late on the cut as the ball skidded on, but the timing was good enough to beat third manMustafizur Rahman [2.0-0-12-0] is back into the attackOn a green pitch, the captain wins the toss and bowls, but he's let his team down. 4 overs, 40 runs won't please the coach or the captain himself one bit!
INDIA:15.6 Mortaza to Rohit, FOUR, wow! Just wow! What timing and what power from Rohit. Mortaza offers a fullish freebie just outside off stump, Rohit backs away slightly and creams the drive hard to the left of extra-cover and he hardly moved after hitting that ball. Knew that it was a certain boundary
INDIA:15.5 Mortaza to Rohit, FOUR, it's up in the air again but lands safely at cow corner. Shortish slower delivery, Rohit pulls, the bat turns in his hands as he makes contact with the ball, long-on runs to his right but could get there only after the ball crossed the rope
INDIA:15.4 Mortaza to Rohit, SIX, in the airrrr, not from the middle of the bat, Shakib runs back and jumps high but it evades him. Slower delivery outside off stump, Rohit steps out and tries to loft hard, went more off the bottom of the bat, yet it had enough legs to clear the fence
INDIA:15.3 Mortaza to Rohit, 2 runs, slower delivery outside off stump, Rohit drives it to the left of long-off, Pandya wanted two and pushed his partner and he succeeds
INDIA:15.2 Mortaza to Pandya, 1 run, Pandya defends this with soft hands towards point and sets off
INDIA:15.1 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, slower delivery outside off stump, Rohit cuts it through cover-pointMashrafe Mortaza [3.0-0-22-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:14.6 Shakib to Pandya, no run, tossed up outside off stump, Pandya drives it to coverHardik Pandya, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:14.5 Shakib to Yuvraj, out Caught by Soumya Sarkar!! Out comes the slog-sweep, but it doesn't get the required elevation. Hit it hard, hit it decently, maybe slightly off the bottom of of the bat, but it went quickly and the fielder at deep mid-wicket made no mistake. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Yuvraj gets down on one knee and tries to muscle one out of the ground, unfortunately he couldn't get the placement right. The fielder there moved slightly to his right and swallowed the ball. Yuvraj c Soumya Sarkar b Shakib 15(16) [4s-1]Shakib to Yuvraj, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:14.4 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit steps out and tries to nudge, gets an inside edge onto pad and it rolls to short mid-wicket
INDIA:14.3 Shakib to Rohit, FOUR, Shakib goes very full, Rohit gets down low and executes the sweep shot to perfection through the vacant square leg region. Timed it so well and split deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket to perfection
INDIA:14.2 Shakib to Yuvraj, 1 run, tossed up outside off stump, Yuvraj drives it to sweeper cover and brings up the fifty partnership
INDIA:14.1 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, 10th T20I fifty for Rohit. He steps out and drives this flighted delivery hard but straight to long-off. Just a gentle raise of the bat and his team-mates applaud from the dug-out
INDIA:13.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Rohit, 1 run, chipped in the air as Rohit fails to read a slower ball, he checked his flick and it was in the air for a while, but the man at mid-on had a bit of ground to cover to his right and he couldn't get there
INDIA:13.5 Mustafizur Rahman to Yuvraj, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Yuvraj runs it down to third man
INDIA:13.4 Mustafizur Rahman to Rohit, 1 run, slightly back of a length, Rohit hops and guides it to third man. Looked like the slower ball and there was a bit of extra bounce, probably the ball hit the seam, Rohit loses his bottom hand grip as he plays that shot
INDIA:13.3 Mustafizur Rahman to Yuvraj, 1 run, not all that short enough to cut and Yuvraj chops it to cover-point
INDIA:13.2 Mustafizur Rahman to Yuvraj, FOUR, oh what a shot! Why play those fancy shots when you can do so well with normal stuff? Overpitched outside off stump at about 129kph, Yuvraj off-drives sweetly from the middle of the bat, mid-off dives but fails to stop the ball
INDIA:13.1 Mustafizur Rahman to Rohit, 1 run, short of length delivery angled across, guided to third manMustafizur Rahman [1.0-0-3-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:12.6 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, fullish and angled in, Rohit works it to deep square leg
INDIA:12.5 Shakib to Yuvraj, 1 run, this is swept along the ground to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:12.4 Shakib to Yuvraj, no run, oh Yuvraj plays the fancy looking reverse-sweep, but makes no contact. Left-arm offie bowl, ball turning back in, target mid-wicket Yuvi!
INDIA:12.3 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit punches off the back foot to long-off
INDIA:12.2 Shakib to Yuvraj, leg byes, 1 run, Yuvraj steps out and then puts his pad as a defensive line, the ball rolls into the off-side and allows a single
INDIA:12.1 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, slider on the stumps, Rohit taps it to coverShakib Al Hasan [1.0-0-4-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:11.6 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Rohit works it to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:11.5 Mortaza to Yuvraj, 1 run, shortish from Mortaza, Yuvraj pulls off the inside half of the bat, goes along the ground to deep mid wicket. That single gets Yuvraj Singh to 1000 T20I runs, he's the 4th Indian to get to that milestone
INDIA:11.4 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit rolls his wrists on this and works this to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:11.3 Mortaza to Rohit, FOUR, fine leg is inside the ring and to bowl a leg-stump line is a sin. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, Rohit helps it on its way to the left of the man at 45 and picks up another boundary
INDIA:11.2 Mortaza to Rohit, 2 runs, slower delivery outside off stump, Rohit leans forward and drives along the ground to sweeper cover
INDIA:11.1 Mortaza to Yuvraj, 1 run, short of length delivery on the leg stump, Yuvraj works it to deep square legMashrafe Mortaza [2.0-0-12-1] is back into the attackSo Rohit has hit 14 runs after that dropped catch.
INDIA:10.6 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, oh dear! This is sloppy from Bangladesh! Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Rohit opens the face of the bat at the last moment and guides it to third man. The fielder at third man was probably moved to his right after a four and six to his rigth earlier in the over, this time Rohit places it to his left, he actually covered the ground and got to the ball, but fumbled and let it go through his legs
INDIA:10.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, SIX, this is even shorter in length and this is an excellent shot from Rohit. Short and wide outside off stump, Rohit upper-cuts and deliberately hits it in the air over backward point, sweet timing and it sails all the way. This is turning out to be a great over for India after that dropped catch
INDIA:10.4 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit starts to hurt straightaway. This is poor bowling from Taskin Ahmed. Short and wide outside off stump, Rohit just opens the face of the bat and guides it past backward point, the timing was so good and third man no chance
INDIA:10.3 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, in the airrrr and dropped. Shakib Al Hasan the culprit at backward point. Good to see a smile on Taskin Ahmed's face despite the catch going down. This is full and just tailing away outside off stump, Rohit square-drives the ball really well, he actually hit it very hard and it was too quick for Shakib there. In fact, the replay shows that the ball came at at awkward height for Shakib there. It was slightly to his left and around chest height, because it came quickly at it, he couldn't do it reverse-cup style
INDIA:10.2 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, almost a CTRL+C, CTRL+V of the previous ball there. Very similar delivery, similar shot attempted and a similar result
INDIA:10.1 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, swing and a miss. Good length delivery wide outside off stump, just enough movement to leave the right-hander, Rohit throws his bat at it as he tries to go over cover, but fails to make contactTaskin Ahmed [2.0-0-8-0] is back into the attackAt the toss, Mortaza spoke about getting a few early wickets and restrtciting India to a decent total, his bowlers have done well so far. Just 52/3 on the board at the end of 10 overs. What total would India be looking at now
INDIA:9.6 Mahmudullah to Rohit, 1 run, Mahmudullah shortens the length on seeing Rohit step out and the batsman only manages to nudge it through mid-wicket
INDIA:9.5 Mahmudullah to Yuvraj, 1 run, spinning away outside off stump, punched through cover for another easy run
INDIA:9.4 Mahmudullah to Rohit, 1 run, short enough for Rohit to rock back and punch to deep extra-cover
INDIA:9.3 Mahmudullah to Yuvraj, 1 run, quicker delivery on the leg stump, Yuvraj works it to square-leg
INDIA:9.2 Mahmudullah to Yuvraj, no run, this is on the stumps, Yuvraj tries to defend off the front foot, almost gets his front pad in line with the stumps there, but he got good amount of bat on it to rule out the LBW shout, just a "oooh" from the bowler and the keeper
INDIA:9.1 Mahmudullah to Rohit, 1 run, the offie to the right-hander and Rohit comes down the track straightaway, driven along the ground to long-on
INDIA:8.6 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, fullish and on the stumps, Rohit leans forward and flicks along the ground to deep mid-wicket
INDIA:8.5 Shakib to Yuvraj, 1 run, big open spaces near cover-point and a sensible Yuvraj Singh collects a single after tapping one with soft hands
INDIA:8.4 Shakib to Rohit, 1 run, Rohit goes deep in the crease and works this wide of mid-on
INDIA:8.3 Shakib to Rohit, no run, this is slightly quicker through the air, Rohit cuts well, but straight to backward point
INDIA:8.2 Shakib to Rohit, no run, shortish and outside off stump, punched towards point
INDIA:8.1 Shakib to Yuvraj, 1 run, not convincing but Yuvraj won't mind. He tried to push at it and got a thick edge that rolls towards short third manShakib Al Hasan, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack
INDIA:7.6 Mahmudullah to Yuvraj, 1 run, tossed up on the off stump, Yuvraj taps it to cover-point and opens his account straightawayYuvraj Singh, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:7.5 Mahmudullah to Raina, out Bowled!! Look at those scenes in the stands. Raina wears a dejected look on his face as he walks back. On a green pitch, a spinner comes on and the batsman thinks I can attack him straightaway, but that ploy has backfired for Raina. Thankfully he didn't look back, for the middle stump was shattered. Credit to Mahmudullah for shortening the length on seeing Raina advance, the left-hander wasn't to the pitch of the ball, yet wanted to drive, a high-risk shot as you won't be covering the line and the ball easily sneaked through to hit the top of middle stump. Raina b Mahmudullah 13(13) [4s-2]Mahmudullah to Raina, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:7.4 Mahmudullah to Rohit, 1 run, nice and full from round the wicket, easily driven down to long-on
INDIA:7.3 Mahmudullah to Raina, 1 run, Raina backs away and exposes all three sticks, Mahmudullah bowls a shortish flatter ball, which is punched off the back foot through extra-cover
INDIA:7.2 Mahmudullah to Rohit, 1 run, leg-stumpish from Mahmudullah, Rohit nudges it to mid-wicket
INDIA:7.1 Mahmudullah to Rohit, no run, shortish from Mahmudullah, Rohit pulls it to mid-wicketMahmudullah, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
INDIA:6.6 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, yes-no, but Raina is safe. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Rohit opens the face of the bat and guides it to the right of third man, Taskin runs to his right from third man and makes a tumbling saves, fires the throw to the keeper, Raina was charging back for the second, but a loud call of "noooo" from his partner meant he was back in time before the keeper broke the stumps with a direct-hit
INDIA:6.5 Mortaza to Raina, 1 run, this is easily worked to mid-wicket
INDIA:6.4 Mortaza to Raina, 2 runs, Raina steps out, tries to go inside-out with the drive, gets it on the outside half of the bat, flies over backward point, Mustafizur runs to his left, slides and makes a good save, relays it to Shakib who throws it to the keeper
INDIA:6.4 Mortaza to Raina, wide, the bumper from the skipper, Raina has his problems against short stuff, but this was way too high. Rightly called a wide
INDIA:6.3 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, easily punched off the back foot through cover-point as Mortaza bowls a short of length delivery outside off stump
INDIA:6.2 Mortaza to Rohit, 2 runs, short of length delivery on the leg stump, Rohit easily works it through backward square leg
INDIA:6.1 Mortaza to Rohit, no run, length delivery from Mortaza, Rohit defends into the on-side
INDIA:5.6 Al-Amin to Raina, no run, swing and a miss and Raina almost did a Pune there. I mean, he lost his leg stump in the first T20I against Sri Lanka and he almost lost one here as well. The ball jags off the seam and Raina tries to swing this short of length delivery across the line, misses the inside edge and goes past the leg stump
INDIA:5.5 Al-Amin to Raina, FOUR, there is that slight movement to the leg-side from Raina to give some room and he cuts this short of length delivery nicely off the back foot and past the man at backward point
INDIA:5.4 Al-Amin to Raina, no run, Raina tries to play his favourite inside-out drive over cover, the length was short enough to play that shot, but he made no contact. Probably the bounce did him in there
INDIA:5.3 Al-Amin to Raina, no run, fullish and just outside off stump, Raina defends
INDIA:5.2 Al-Amin to Raina, FOUR, in the air and just wide of the fielder. For a moment it looked like the man at short cover had it! Fullish and outside off stump, Raina steps out and tries to drive, gets it on the bottom of the bat, hence no timing and the replay shows that the fielder couldn't get a hand despite a full length dive to his right
INDIA:5.1 Al-Amin to Raina, no run, good length delivery on the leg stump, Raina defends into the on-sideAl-Amin Hossain [1.0-0-7-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:4.6 Mortaza to Raina, 1 run, Raina was backing away slightly to go big, but Mortaza cramped him for room with a short of length delivery on the leg stump, Raina could only dab it through backward point
INDIA:4.5 Mortaza to Raina, no run, shortish delivery outside off stump, Raina tries to run it down to third man, but the extra bounce foxed him. Could have so so easily edged that to the keeper
INDIA:4.4 Mortaza to Raina, no run, full and outside off stump, Raina off-drives nicely off the front foot, but mid-off is very wide and he stops the ball, Rohit was keen for a run, but Raina sent him backSuresh Raina, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:4.3 Mortaza to Kohli, out Caught by Mahmudullah!! So how crucial was the dive from the fielder the previous ball to save what was looking like a certain boundary. He not only stopped the boundary, but he also forced Kohli to be on strike for this ball and Bangladesh have the big fish now. Small things do matter in life! Don't they? Nothing but a length delivery from Mortaza, the frustration probably got to Kohli, who was beaten twice in the previous over. He tried to go over the top this time around and totally mistimed it - the ball hit him high on the bat. The man at mid-off settled under it and took it reverse-cup style. Massive blow for India. Kohli c Mahmudullah b Mortaza 8(12) [4s-1]Mortaza to Kohli, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:4.2 Mortaza to Rohit, 1 run, this is a good looking off-drive, but mid-off dives to his right and makes a half-stop, can't prevent the run though
INDIA:4.1 Mortaza to Rohit, 2 runs, in the airrrr, there is a man in the deep at mid-wicket, but it lands to his left. Shakib was the fielder there. Shortish delivery on the stumps, bounced a bit extra than Rohit anticipated, hence he couldn't time the ball, hit high on the bat and flew high in the air, Shakib ran to his left, covered decent ground, but couldn't get thereMashrafe Mortaza, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:3.6 Mustafizur Rahman to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Kohli punches it off the back foot to backward point
INDIA:3.5 Mustafizur Rahman to Kohli, no run, beaten again! This is a clever slower delivery from Mustafizur, Kohli once again steps out and tries to clear the infield, but the lack of pace on the ball completely foxed him. Great start from Mustafizur, he's beaten Kohli twice in the over
INDIA:3.4 Mustafizur Rahman to Kohli, 2 runs, short of length delivery on the leg stump, Kohli tucks it through backward square leg, fine leg is inside the ring and it's good enough for a couple of runs
INDIA:3.3 Mustafizur Rahman to Kohli, no run, this is tapped off the back foot towards short point, a bit of yes-no between the batsmen and in the end, Rohit is sent back. Surely, we don't want to see another run-out between these two
INDIA:3.2 Mustafizur Rahman to Kohli, no run, Kohli gives the charge and tries to unsettle Mustafizur Rahman early in his spell, but makes no contact. So a moral victory for the bowler. Kohli swung hard at it and the ball flew past the outside edge of the bat. Good on Mustafizur's part that he dragged the length back on seeing the batsman advance
INDIA:3.1 Mustafizur Rahman to Kohli, no run, Kohli taps it to point off the back foot
INDIA:3.1 Mustafizur Rahman to Kohli, wide, good length delivery angled across the right-hander, well wide outside off stump, Kohli throws his bat and gets beaten, crowd appeals for a catch, but the umpire stretches his arms. Not sure if that was a wide thoughMustafizur Rahman, comes into the attackOne slip in place
INDIA:2.6 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 2 runs, this is sloppy from the man at cover. This was a dot ball and Rohit was actually practicing placing the cut shot better next time round. Short of a length delivery just coming back in slightly, the ball rolls to cover off the inside half of the bat, the fielder fires a wayward throw to the keeper, who could not stop the ball despite jumping high
INDIA:2.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Rohit cuts and finds the man at backward point
INDIA:2.4 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, 1 run, short of length delivery on the leg stump, Kohli inside-edges the tuck onto the thigh pad and it rolls to backward square leg
INDIA:2.3 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, FOUR, oh almost chopped on! The ball is doing enough for Taskin Ahmed when he tries to bowl the inswingers, but for me, he is not bowling those enough and trying too many variations. Stick to the incoming delivery Taskin! Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Kohli was on the back foot to punch again, but the ball jagged back a long way and almost shaved the sticks. Unlucky for the bowler that a good ball has gone for four
INDIA:2.2 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, no run, nice looking back foot punch, but the fielder at cover-point makes a good stop diving to his leftInterestingly, Bangladesh have employed only one slip for Kohli.
INDIA:2.1 Taskin Ahmed to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery just outside off stump, Kohli defends off the back foot
INDIA:1.6 Al-Amin to Rohit, FOUR, nicely punched off the back foot and Rohit hardly moved after timing that ball so sweetly. He knew that this was a certain boundary as soon as it passed that diving fielder at cover. Slightly back of a length and outside off stump, Rohit allows the ball to come and then punches with lovely hands to the left of the man at cover. First boundary of the game
INDIA:1.5 Al-Amin to Rohit, no run, Rohit gets behind the line and defends well
INDIA:1.4 Al-Amin to Kohli, 1 run, width on offer outside off stump, the length is short enough as well for Kohli guide off the back foot to deep backward pointVirat Kohli, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:1.3 Al-Amin to Dhawan, out Bowled!! Out goes the off stump! Al-Amin roars in delight with all the support from the capacity crowd. What a sight for a fast bowler! Got to move your feet, Shikhar Dhawan, got to move your feet. Good length delivery pitching around middle and off from over the wicket and then nipping back in, Dhawan went for the drive with a big gap between bat pad. His front foot hardly moved and it easily sneaked through the gate to hit the top of off stump. So the captain wins the toss and looks for an early wicket, Al-Amin responds in kind. Dhawan b Al-Amin 2(4)Al-Amin to Dhawan, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:1.2 Al-Amin to Dhawan, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, Dhawan pushes it into the off-side
INDIA:1.1 Al-Amin to Dhawan, 2 runs, a fumble and the Indians get an extra run. That won't please the bowler. Slightly back of a length and just outside off stump, Dhawan uses the depth of the crease and guides it to the right of backward point, the man rushing from the deep fails to pick it up cleanly and Dhawan was alert enough to steal an extra runAl-Amin Hossain, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackTwo slips and a gully in place for Al-Amin
INDIA:0.6 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, on a good length and close to the off stump, Rohit waits and defends
INDIA:0.5 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, beaten! Short of a length delivery outside off stump, not much of movement on this one, Rohit goes hard at the cut shot, wanted to hit it in the air, but the ball bounced a bit extra and flew past the edge of the bat
INDIA:0.4 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, oh once again good amount of movement off the seam into the right-hander, but not close enough to knock the off pole over as Rohit shoulders arms
INDIA:0.3 Taskin Ahmed to Dhawan, leg byes, 1 run, oh that was a freebie but Dhawan has missed out on a boundary-scoring opportunity. Short of a length down the leg-side, a fine little tickle would have been four, but Dhawan fails to get bat on ball and it rolls behind square off the thigh pad
INDIA:0.2 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, 1 run, looks like this was the attempted away-going ball from Taskin, Rohit opens the face of the bat and guides it to third man. First runs on the board and Rohit will feel sligthly better now
INDIA:0.1 Taskin Ahmed to Rohit, no run, wow! What a start for Taskin Ahmed. This one nipped back in sharply and also bounced a bit extra, was slightly back of a length that started outside off stump, Rohit was on the back foot to block, he was hurried by the movement and the bounce, jammed his bat down and it rolled off the splice of the bat towards the slip cordonRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. Taskin Ahmed will open the attackRight then... The players are out in the middle. The countdown begins and play says the umpire. Big roar from the crowd as Taskin charges in. Two slips waiting for the edge.Having said that, we have seen strange things happen in this game of cricket. On a similar pitch, in a Test match that concluded earlier today, a bloke called Brendon McCullum took the attack to the bowlers and smashed the fastest ever hundred in the history of Test cricket in what was said to be ideal conditions for fast bowling. How will the likes of Rohit, Dhawan, Kohli and the rest approach with the bat tonight? Time will tell...So, looking at the decent covering of grass on the pitch, Bangladesh have gone for more pace. Mashrafe Mortaza, Al-Amin Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman and Taskin Ahmed. Hmmm! That looks quite a bowling line-up and well equipped for a seamer-friendly track. The hosts would be delighted by the fact that the last time India played a T20I on a green pitch - against Sri Lanka just a couple of weeks ago - MS Dhoni's boys completely lost the plot. In fact, they were reduced to 58/7. Mortaza and Co. would want to do something similar tonight as well.Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Imrul Kayes, Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahman, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Mohammad Mithun, Al-Amin Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Taskin AhmedIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Hardik Pandya, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashish Nehra, Jasprit BumrahDhoni: Only one change, Virat (Kohli) comes in place of (Ajinkya) Rahane. This looks a better side with Hardik (Pandya) and the part-timers can contribute as well. It may not be a very crucial toss, so we don't want to look too far ahead. It looks a good wicket, which is slightly on the softer side.Mortaza: We would like to bowl first. There is a bit of rain forecast as well, that is the reason why we want to bowl first. Hopefully we will restrict them to a decent total and chase it down. Four pacers for us.Bangladesh have won the toss and have opted to fieldWell, well, well! MS Dhoni is walking out for the toss. So he is fit to play.Pitch Report (Deep Dasgupta): This pitch is a little different. There is a lot more grass than normal here. It's been overcast. The pitch was covered for most part of the day. So it has not had much of sun on it. If I were to win the toss, I would bowl first.Weather Update: There is a rain threat to this game. Ganesh who is at ground has the latest news, "Rained heavily around noon, but cleared up rather quickly was gloomy until late evening." Hope it stays clear and we have a full game.Bangladesh, on the other hand, have been very inconsistent when it comes T20Is. In a recently concluded series against Zimbabwe, they allowed the African side to come from 2-0 down to level the series. The likely starting XI is yet to be finalized for the World T20 and what better way to get it right than try it out in the Asia Cup. One man they will be looking forward to performing is Mustafizur Rahman, who tormented India with his variations last time when these two sides met.The No. 1 T20I side in the world, India, have everything going their way in the shortest form of the game. They whitewashed Australia in their own den and came from behind to beat Sri Lanka 2-1. This is their last chance to get the permutations and combinations right ahead of the World T20, if at all they haven't already. The only concern for them will be the fitness of skipper MS Dhoni, who is not doing much football practice and is only standing around, says my colleague Ganesh Chandrasekaran. Parthiv Patel is already there with the team as a back up for Dhoni.The Asia Cup is here in an all new avatar. For the first time it is being played in a T20 format. The qualifiers are done and dusted and we saw United Arab Emirates making it to the tournament proper. They pipped Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Oman. Today we have the hosts Bangladesh locking horns with India in the opener.Preview by Ganesh ChandrasekaranThe Asia Cup is one of the lesser fancied tournaments in terms of public imagination. Amongst the many multilateral series being played in international cricket, this is one tournament that has struggled to find its own niche. Tournaments like the World Cup, World T20 and the ICC Champions Trophy all hold its own place in the public memory mainly because of the relevance of the prefix of ICC before it. The Asia Cup however struggles to capture that fascination mainly because of the anonymity of the Asian Cricket Council. However, the tournament is now going to act as a percussor for the World T20 and will be played in the same format unlike previous editions.Given that it features the top nations from the sub-continent, it cannot but act as a perfect build-up to the premier event that begins barely a day after the final of this tournament. That adds an extra edge to the significance of the 2016 edition in Bangladesh.Much of the questions to the captains in the pre-match press conference surrounded Mustafizur Rehman and his exploits against the Indians last year in the ODI series. That series win catapulted Bangladesh's growing prominence in the fifty-over format. The off-field drama surrounding the then ICC chairman and president (N Srinivasan and Mustafa Kamal) during the ICC World Cup 2015 also fuelled a rivalry that is in its infancy.India and Bangladesh cannot be placed on level terms based on cricketing skills alone but the frenzied nature of the T20 format quells a lot of the imbalance. Bangladesh's rise in the fifty-over format cannot be directly correlated to an increase in stature in T20Is. They drew a series against Zimbabwe at home recently and will need to raise their game in T20s just as they have done in the other limited overs format.The Asia Cup thus presents them with a perfect opportunity to kick-start proceedings. Playing on home turf comes with its own advantages. The vociferous crowd support is a given and the know-how of conditions is a crucial factor as well. They are no longer considered 'minnows' in the international arena and India will still remember being stung in ODIs by the same opposition. For the hosts, this acts as a perfect setting to gather some momentum going into the World T20. The same holds good for other teams as well but for Bangladesh, the significance of a victory against India in the opener, in front of their home crowd, might be a bigger shot in the arm.For India, having arrived upon a settled T20 squad is a boon but they will be focussing on sustaining the momentum gained by winning back-to-back T20I series wins. They will be focussing on striking a balance between winning games and providing opportunities for all their members of the T20 squad.They might already be forced to make one injury enforced change if MS Dhoni doesn't pass fit on the day of the game. The skipper has been suffering from back spasms and Parthiv Patel might end up donning the gloves without yet attending a practice session in Dhaka. If it comes down to that then India will also be forced to tinker their batting order as Patel is a batsman who finds the top-order more suited to his style. The rest of the batting order picks itself but one concern for India might be the lack of batting game-time for Yuvraj Singh. A promotion in the batting order might be on the cards at some point during the tournament if Singh does not get enough chances naturally.The bowling unit is a far more settled one with Jasprit Bumrah's performances filling in for a gaping void while Ashish Nehra, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja know their specific roles in the format.The hosts on the other hand will try experimenting a little more before they arrive upon their final eleven ahead of the World T20. The absence of Tamim Iqbal does leave a hole at the top of the order, but Imrul Kayes is expected to make up for it with his experience. They could also plump for a rookie in Mohammad Mithun to take up the top-order slot while the slot for a third pacer might be a shoot-out between Al-Amin Hossain and Taskin Ahmed. There will be a lot of focus on how Mustafizur performs in his second season after catching many a big name by surprise when he first came on.India were found out recently on a pacy pitch at Pune and if Mirpur offers something similar to the one offered to the India U19 team in the World Cup final recently, then it could offer them more than a slight challenge. But as the qualifier games showed, this pitch may not have as much life on it.Teams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli(c), Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Parthiv Patel(w), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashish Nehra, Jasprit Bumrah, Ajinkya Rahane, Harbhajan Singh, Pawan Negi, MS Dhoni, Bhuvneshwar KumarBangladesh (From): Imrul Kayes, Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Mahmudullah, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Al-Amin Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Mustafizur Rahman, Abu Hider, Mohammad Mithun, Nurul Hasan, Taskin AhmedLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
