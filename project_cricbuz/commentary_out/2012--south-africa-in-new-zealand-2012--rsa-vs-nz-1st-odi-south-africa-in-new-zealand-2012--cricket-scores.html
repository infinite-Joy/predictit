Many of them got off to starts (with Williamson and Brendon McCullum scoring over fifty) but none managed to post a big score. Too many start-stop knocks in the innings, and some tight bowling from South Africa have kept the hosts under check. South Africa will fancy their chances now, but the Kiwi bowlers have some runs to work with. Join us in 30 minutes for the chase.4
NEW ZEALAND:49.6  Morne Morkel to Southee, FOUR, Southee does his job. These are useful runs! Morne once again maintains it full and straight but Southee gives himself some room and slices it over point, not exactly where he wanted to hit but does it matter?

It has a nice grass cover and it is a bit harder. There will be some pace and bounce for the bowlers. The side boundaries are pretty short and the batsmen should enjoy batting on this surface. 250 should be a minimum on this surface reckons Simon DoullAB de Villiers: Not too disappointed with losing the toss, it seems like a good batting wicket and will stay true for 100 overs. We need to get some early wickets with the new ball. Smith, Kallis and Steyn are back in the team. I would like to stay calm as a captain and we need to play the pressure situations well.McCullum: The pitch looks very good and if we bat sensibly we can get a good score on the board. We have picked a balanced team and we hope to do well. We are up against a very good opponent, they showed what they were capable of in the T20 matches. We have addressed some of our shortcomings and we are excited about the challenge ahead.New Zealand have won the toss and elected to batThe teasers are over in the form of the three T20 matches and we are set for the real action to begin.
