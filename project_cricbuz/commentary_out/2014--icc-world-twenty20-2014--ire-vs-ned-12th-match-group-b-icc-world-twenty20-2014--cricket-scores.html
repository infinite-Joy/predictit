How are Netherlands going to approach this run-chase? Fingers crossed, even in the Zimbabwe camp.The Netherland bowlers didn't have any answer to the onslaught by the Irish batsmen. Only Ahsan Malik seemed to have the quality to retrict the batsmen at the death. A target of 190 and that should be chased within 13 overs seems a formidable task. However, funny things have happened in cricket and it will take a miracle for Netherland to chase this down. Join us back in a short while for their reply.....Ireland have certainly played themselves into the main tournament. They got off to a flier as Porterfield looked in ominous touch as he played some delightful cover drives. He was well supported by Joyce with whom he added a 41-run stand. They lost both well set batsmen, but Poynter and Kevin O'Brien steadied the innings.

The Irish openers are out in the middle. Swart to open the attack....Porterfield: "It is a simple equation for us. If we win we go through else not. Hopefully, we will achieve that and make it three wins in a row. I don't think its a bad toss to lose. It looks like a good batting wicket. We have played Netherlands a few times and know what they are capable of, so we won't take them lightly. Stirling is playing, he still has some bruises but is fit enough to play."Borren: "Yes, we know that we have to win by a big margin to qualify. Zimbabwe winning has made it slightly difficult for us. We are going to field first. We aren't sure what is a good total hence the decision. We bowled and fielded well in the last match but have to score some runs with the bat. We are playing with the same team."Here is the latest scenario for Netherlands to qualify, they need to win with 37 to 42 balls to spare regardless of what Ireland score.Teams:Netherlands (Playing XI): Stephan Myburgh, Michael Swart, Wesley Barresi(w), Tom Cooper, Peter Borren(c), Ben Cooper, Mudassar Bukhari, Logan van Beek, Timm van der Gugten, Pieter Seelaar, Ahsan MalikIreland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Andrew Poynter, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, Stuart Thompson, Alex Cusack, Andy McBrine, Tim Murtagh, George DockrellPaul Stirling is playing for Ireland. He had injured himself in the last match against UAE but he has been declared fit.Netherlands have won the toss and have opted to fieldZimbabwe stay alive in the tournament after their thumping win over UAE. It's time for the final match of the first round. Ireland and Netherlands, both with a chance to top the group, lock horns here at Sylhet. There is a bit of rain forcecast later in the evening but hopefully, we will get to see a full game. Ireland have been simply outstanding so far in the tournament and they will certainly look to make life difficult for the Netherlands. The equation for Peter Borren's men to edge both Zimbabwe and Ireland for qualification to the main tournament is, a win by 36 runs or a win with 29 balls to spare. It will be interesting to see if the teams make any changes to their playing XIs. Toss and more coming up in a short while.Teams:Ireland (From): William Porterfield(c), George Dockrell, Andy McBrine, Kevin O'Brien, Andrew Poynter, Max Sorensen, Stuart Thompson, Craig Young, Alex Cusack, Ed Joyce, Tim Murtagh, Niall O'Brien, James Shannon, Paul Stirling, Gary Wilson(w)Netherlands (From): Tom Cooper, Peter Borren(c), Mudassar Bukhari, Ahsan Malik, Stephan Myburgh, Pieter Seelaar, Eric Szwarczynski, Timm van der Gugten, Wesley Barresi(w), Ben Cooper, Tom Heggelman, Vivian Kingma, Michael Rippon, Michael Swart, Logan van BeekLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
