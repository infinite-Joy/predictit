WEST INDIES:46.6  Harbhajan to Baugh, out Lbw!! Harbhajan's honeymoon continues, two good performances with the ball back to back. He did it in the T20 and he's done it today, this one was slightly quicker, Baugh walked across but missed the whippy flick, was trapped in front of leg, the only doubt that the umpire would have had is whether the ball pitched in line or not, he seems to be convinced, up goes the dreaded finger.

Waste of time!
WEST INDIES:46.3  Harbhajan to Baugh, no run, fires one in outside off, looked like Baugh missed it, he flashed the blade and Parthiv took the catch on the second attempt, the Indians thought there was an edge, they appealed and it went upstairs to check whether it came off the bat or if it was a bump ball, third umpire had a close look at it and replays showed that there was no contact made
WEST INDIES:46.2  Harbhajan to Baugh, 2 runs, Baugh drives it through extra cover and immediately calls for a second run, it was touch and go, the throw came in quickly but Sammy dived full length with his bat stretched and he made it by just a bitAn appeal for run-out, Sammy looks safe!

Dwayne Bravo st Patel b Harbhajan 22(20) [6s-1] Harbhajan to Dwayne Bravo, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!

That was certainly a LOL moment, Samuels went back and across looking to play across the line, the ball sneaks between his legs after just brushing his trouser and hits the top of middle and leg, Samuels is disappointed with that one, totally uncalled for and Raina has broken the partnership. Samuels b Raina 55(75) [4s-3 6s-2] Raina to Samuels, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

WEST INDIES:0.1  Praveen Kumar to Simmons, wide, a beautiful outie, but it pitched outside off and swung away, so the umpire Nero stretches his armsSimmons and Edwards are at the crease. Simmons is on strike. Praveen Kumar will open the attackThis is India's first ODI game since the most memorable World Cup win at the Wankhede on the 2nd of April. An interesting point to note is, only 4 players playing today (Kohli, Raina, Harbhajan and Munaf) were a part of that epic game.Captains' comments:Raina: We would have bowled first as well, the wicket looks good. We have one change, Mishra comes in place of Ashwin. We have a good young side, hopefully they'll do well. We have done really well in the last couple of months and I have full confidence on our bowlers.Sammy: We would like to bat, the wicket looks better than what we saw in the T20s. Like India showed, we need to plan the innings well and we'll go put a good total. The selectors have stuck with the same team that played last against Pakistan, so Pollard misses out. It is about rotating the strike early on and build a platform.Surprise move that, Pollard has been dropped. Amit Mishra has replaced R Ashwin for India. They are going in with more variations.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Parthiv Patel(w), Suresh Raina(c), Virat Kohli, Subramaniam Badrinath, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Praveen Kumar, Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Munaf PatelWest Indies (Playing XI): Kirk Edwards, Lendl Simmons, Darren Bravo, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Bravo, Darren Sammy(c), Carlton Baugh(w), Ravi Rampaul, Anthony Martin, Devendra BishooWest Indies have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: The surface has dried out, there hasn't been any rain since two days. The wicket looks rough, there won't be much pace. It will probably be an even paced turner. There won't be any movement. The team that wins the toss would probably look to bat first.West Indies haven't won an ODI series against any Test playing nation since 2008. The second string Indian side would be their best chance of turning things around.A warm welcome to the 1st ODI between West Indies and India from Port of Spain, Trinidad. It's a pleasant morning, the forecast says scattered thunderstorms and let's keep our fingers crossed. The return of Dwayne Bravo, Sarwan and Pollard will boost the depleted West Indies side, while India in all likelihood may go in with more or less the same side. This is Ajith, I'll bring you the game along with Pradeep and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be back soon.The Preview by Vishaal LoganathanIndia have dispelled fears that their second string side would be uncompetitive against the West Indies in their own backyard with their fantastic come-from-behind victory in the only T20 international, and will go into the ODI series with renewed confidence that they can do the job expected of them. The West Indies on the other hand will be looking to bounce back after being outplayed in the T20.No Gayle-No PainThe above, of course, applies to India and not West Indies. Several Indian bowlers would have breathed a sigh of relief after learning that Chris Gayle will not be part of the set up - at least for the first 2 ODIs. The left hander was in tremendous form in the recently concluded IPL and ended with the highest number of runs and the Man-of-the-Series prize. The absence of the big hitting all rounder could tilt the scales in favour of the visitors.All rounders' returnThe West Indian team suffered a lot due to a lack of experience in the last game, but they will be well served in this match with the return of two fine all rounders in Kieron Pollard and Dwayne Bravo. The duo can prove handy with both bat and ball and will give Darren Sammy more options as they aim to start the series against the World Champions with a win. Ramnaresh Sarwan also finds his way back into the team which should add more steel to the batting line up.The Simmons effectLendl Simmons has had a stellar year so far, notching up 4 half centuries on the trot in ODIs. With a power packed middle order, much will depend on Simmons to give West Indies the kind of start the middle order can exploit. His batting average in 2011 stands at a dizzying 69.75. All his matches this year have been against Pakistan, and he showed he was quite comfortable facing the spinners while the rest of his team struggled against the likes of Saeed Ajmal and Abdur Rehman.New faces keen to make an impactThe last time India played in an ODI, it was at the World Cup final at Wankhede. The team for the ODI series has undergone a tremendous change with most of the seniors not present due to fatigue or injuries. This series will thus be an ideal opportunity for the new faces to try and secure their spot in the team. S Badrinath has already shown he can play hero with a match winning innings in the T20 and he will look to continue in the same vein. Rohit Sharma, Parthiv Patel and Amit Mishra among others have found their way back into the team and they will be trying everything possible to ensure they stay there.Spin - the main weapon?Gone are the days when West Indies' main weapon was their tearaway fast bowlers - nowadays they turn to a diminutive young man called Devendra Bishoo. The young leg spinner has impressed one and all with his bowling and India will be keen to not let him inflict too much damage. For India, on the other hand, Suresh Raina has a handy concoction of spinners he can turn to. R Ashwin has proved to be a canny bowler with the knack of picking key wickets and with Harbhajan Singh at the other end it could prove too much to handle for the Windies.QuotesDarren Sammy: Dot balls have been plaguing us at the end. With people like Barnwell in the team, we know we can chase big totals. The batsmen should play the spinners better come Monday. We need to go back to the drawing board. I was a little surprised by the pitch.Harbhajan Singh: We just want to take it one game at a time. We have got a quality side. Although it's a young side, many of them have done well in the IPL and on the domestic circuit, and we are all looking forward to the remainder of the tour.
