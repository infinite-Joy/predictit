ZIMBABWE:33.2 Rahat Ali to Sean Williams, out Caught by Ahmed Shehzad!! In the airrrr and straight to backward point. This is just the start Pakistan wanted after the drinks break. Short and outside off stump, it was there to be hit, Williams cuts well but doesn't bother to keep it down. Shehzad takes it with both hands above his head. He was suggesting to his team-mates that initially he didn't see the ball coming at him. Williams walks away in disappointment. He's played a good hand for Zimbabwe. Sean Williams c Ahmed Shehzad b Rahat Ali 33(32) [4s-2]Rahat Ali to Sean Williams, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:33.1 Rahat Ali to Sean Williams, no run, fullish and outside off stump, tentatively defended off the front footRahat Ali [7.0-0-31-0] is back into the attackOnce Masakadza threw his wicket away while facing up to Mohammad Irfan, Taylor showed his class by collecting a few boundaries off Shahid Afridi's bowling. Taylor chipping Afridi straight down the ground for a four in the 23rd over of the game, indicates that he is a smart cricketer, as in the past, many batsmen have paid the price for playing across the line against Afridi's quickish leg breaks. Unfortunately, Taylor was caught down the leg side off Riaz's bowling. Sean Williams too looked in good touch. Williams' game is built on the old maxim of playing each ball on its merit. However, Ervine got a reprieve, as Umar Akmal dropped a catch off Afridi's bowling. Zimbabwe certainly need Williams to get a big score. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 17 overs: For a brief period, Hamilton Masakadza and Brendan Taylor played with equanimity to construct a fine partnership for Zimbabwe. Masakadza looked in good touch, especially when he played straight down the ground. On the other hand, Taylor twinned orthodox shots with improvisation. In the 20th over of the innings, Taylor gave a glimpse of his ability to play shots in a 360-degree arc. He went down on one knee to ramp a short delivery from Wahab Riaz over the wicket-keeper for a boundary. The key to executing the shot was that Taylor kept his eyes on the ball and the great extension of his hands helped him to guide it over the wicket-keeper.Drinks are on the field now

ZIMBABWE:16.1 Rahat Ali to Brendan Taylor, no run, short of a length and just outside off, Taylor prods across and blocks itIrfan has certainly shown that if a pacer bends his back, he will always get some encouragement from a true surface. Interestingly, ever since Kevin Mitchell (Jnr) became the curator at the Gabba in the early 1990s, there has been a feeling that it has turned into a bat first wicket. However, in ODIs, the team batting second has won four out of the last five matches at this ground, while one game was abandoned. It indicates that for ODIs, the wicket will hold true over the duration of 100 overs.It was Chibhabha, who looked to take on the challenge of facing up to Irfan and Sohail Khan by essaying a few boundaries, Unfortunately from Zimbabwe's perspective, Irfan, then produced the breakthrough with a fine delivery that bounced disconcertingly on Chibhabha to take the edge. Irfan was too quick for him as Chibhabha couldn't take the bat out of the line in time. To make it even better for Pakistan, Raza too lost his wicket to Irfan. Irfan's ability to create that left-armer's angle and angle it back into Raza did the trick on that occasion. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 16 overs: While chasing down a rather modest target, Zimbabwe's openers, Chamu Chibhabha and Sikandar Raza started cautiously. Mohammad Irfan, the towering giant, troubled Raza by extracting bounce. He got one to climb awkwardly to hit Raza's chest and followed it up with an inswinging yorker. However, Raza was able to survive. Drinks are on the field now

Chibhabha is on strike. Irfan will open the attackTwo slips, a gully and a leg gully in place. Misbah is on the offensive..Welcome back.. Misbah had a lot to say at the team huddle. Can Zimbabwe chase down 235 and cause a huge upset?Zimbabwe had a few anxious moments in the field as Elton Chigumbura suffered a suspected muscle tear after he tripped and fell while looking to save a boundary. It is bad news for Zimbabwe as they would perhaps need Chigumbura to chip in with a few runs later on in the match. Zimbabwe's camp would also be slightly concerned with their fielding as they dropped a couple of chances in the end overs. For Pakistan, they need wickets with the new ball to have any chance of coming back into the game.Misbah and Haris Sohail tried to resurrect Pakistan's fortunes. But after stitching a 50-run partnership, Haris hit it straight to Sean Williams off Sikandar Raza's bowling and with a forlorn look on his face, took a long walk back to the pavilion. Haris also played out a lot of dot deliveries and that didn't help Pakistan's cause. Akmal played a few eye-catching shots, but Williams produced a wonderful spell to take the key wickets of both Akmal and Shahid Afridi and check Pakistan's progress. In fact, it was a cracking delivery bowled by Williams to Afridi as it spun sharply to beat the outside edge and castle Afridi. With wickets falling at the other end, Misbah looked to be the glue of Pakistan's innings and composed a fine fifty. In the slog overs, Riaz with his pyrotechnics, smashed a flurry of boundaries to help Pakistan to end up with a decent total on the board. Earlier, Pakistan's opener, Nasir Jamshed continued to struggle for runs as he was dismissed after scoring just one run. Jamshed has amassed just 58 runs in the last eight ODIs he has played. Ahmed Shehzad followed him back to the pavilion as he lost his wicket to Chatara. It was a gem of a delivery that straightened off the deck to take the edge of Shehzad's bat and Brendan Taylor took an easy catch behind the stumps. Zimbabwe's bowlers put up an impressive performance to restrict Pakistan to a below par total. Misbah-ul-Haq held the innings together, and Umar Akmal and Wahab Riaz played quickfire knocks to lift Pakistan's sagging spirits to some extent. It was Tendai Chatara and Tinashe Panyangara, who bowled with great disciplines to leave Pakistan wobbling at 14 for 2 after the completion of 10 overs. On expected lines, both the pacers extracted movement in the air and off the deck at the Gabba to trouble the batsmen. Chatara was duly rewarded for his metronomic control upfront with two wickets. Tawanda Mupariwa too bowled well. Sean Williams, the slow left-arm orthodox, followed it up by taking a couple of crucial wickets to put Zimbabwe in the ascendancy. 4
PAKISTAN:49.6 Panyangara to Riaz, FOUR, gee! What a shot to end the innings. He's hit that very, very hard. Full and outside off stump, Riaz drills it very hard, Panyangara tries to catch it in his followthrough as it was in the air for a while, but it went very quickly past him, long-off runs to his right and puts in the dive but the ball was too quick for him as well

PAKISTAN:32.2 S Raza to U Akmal, no run, on the leg stump, turned to mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:32.1 S Raza to Misbah, 1 run, flatter ball down the leg-side, flicked into the on-sideIn 2002, when Australia played England in a a Test match at the Gabba, Simon Jones injured his knee, while looking to save a boundary. It is believed that the rye and couch grasses at the Gabba are coarser than one usually gets to see at some other grounds. In fact, at other grounds, the grass absorbs moisture, and that results in minimising the friction and the fielder can slide. Zimbabwe have bowled with purpose, but it has to be said that Pakistan's batsmen have shown no intent to take on their bowlers. Umar Akmal though, by playing a few eye-catching shots gave Pakistan the hope of amassing a competitive total on the board. On the other hand, there were a few anxious moments for Zimbabwe when Chigumbura seemed to have hurt his knee while looking to save a boundary. Fortunately, he was able to walk and he was helped off the ground. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 17 overs: Despite struggling to bisect the gaps in the field, Misbah-ul-Haq and Haris Sohail stitched a 50-run partnership. However, after playing out a lot of dot deliveries, Haris threw his wicket by pulling a delivery straight to Sean Williams off Sikandar Raza's bowling. On occasions, Elton Chigumbura, Zimbabwe's captain, struggled to bowl to the left-handed Haris. However, Raza broke the partnership at a crucial juncture by taking the wicket of Haris.Drinks are on the field now

In fact, both Chatara and Panyangara have bowled well upfront in this tournament. On expected lines, the deck at the Gabba has offered some encouragement for the seamers. However, the batsmen haven't helped their cause by hanging back in the crease. For Pakistan, Misbah-ul-Haq has to yet again shore up their innings. Unfortunately, he has struggled for timing so far. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 15 overs: Zimbabwe's seamers, Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai Chatara and Tawanda Mupariwa found enough movement in the air and off the deck to trouble Pakistan's batsmen. Chatara was rewarded for his unremitting control with the wicket of Nasir Jamshed. Jamshed has made just 58 runs in the last eight ODIs he has played. Chatara, then produced a superb delivery that straightened off the deck to induce the edge and send Ahmed Shehzad back to the pavilion. Drinks are on the field now

Panyangara will open the attackNasir Jamshed will take first strike. Panyangara is the opening bowler for Zimbabwe.Shehzad gets a pat on the back from coach Waqar Younis as he strides out to the middle. Zimbabwe are in the middle of a team huddle.It's the last match at the Gabba and the two teams are pretty much at the last chance saloon position. A loss here, and chances for the losing team to get through to the knock-out stage gets even more tougher.Teams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Chamu Chibhabha, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w), Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura(c), Solomon Mire, Tawanda Mupariwa, Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai ChataraPakistan (Playing XI): Nasir Jamshed, Ahmed Shehzad, Haris Sohail, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Sohail Khan, Rahat Ali, Mohammad IrfanPakistan have won the toss and have opted to batChigumbura: "It's going to be a tough day, but we are up for it. Hopefully we can play good cricket today. I think it's still a good wicket to bat in the second innings, we just have to make sure that we play good cricket today. I think today it is going to be better (talking about death bowling), I believe that we have worked out, hopefully we can execute today. It's important, especially if you are chasing, to have someone, who's in and who can bat through the innings. So hopefully we can have someone today, who can bat through. Three changes, Chibhabha, Mire and Mupariwa in and then Kamungozi, Chakabva and Matsikenyeri are out."Misbah: "It's very important for us, especially this game, because we lost the first two games. Just really want to win a game here and just have to play well. We are going to bat first. I think it's good to have a total on the board. Especially, under lights in Australia, we have been noticing that, once you get a good total on the board it's not easy to just chase it down. What we are looking at the tournament is good to have wickets in hand, and just build up the innings nicely and then, you could in the last 10-15 overs you could really capitalise on that. This is what the trend is going on during this World Cup. So hopefully we have just manage to do that. We've got one change, unfortunately Younis Khan is not playing and Rahat Ali is in."Pitch Report: "There was a lot of grass a couple of days ago, but it's nicely rolled in. If you tap the wicket, it's rock hard and it's a typical Gabba wicket. The new ball will do its bit early on, but teams should look to bat first on the surface," reckons Wasim Akram.Pakistan opener Ahmed Shehzad has been cleared for this contest after suffering an ankle injury. Shehzad, who was complaining of pain in his left ankle after team practice a few days ago, was sent for an MRI scan, but the right-hander is declared fit for today's game, which is great news for Pakistan as he plays a key role with the bat at the top of the order.Head-to-head: Expectedly, Pakistan lead Zimbabwe on head-to-head count in ODIs by a margin of 42-3. However, Zimbabwe will take confidence from the fact that they managed to beat Misbah's boys in August, 2013. When it comes to World Cup cricket though, Pakistan have never lost to Zimbabwe.Weather Report: It's a bright and sunny day at the Gabba. The temperature is expected to hover around 31 degrees. The relative humidity is 53%. There are no chances of showers."We have to improve how we are bowling at the death and sooner we do, the better for the team; and looking at the games we have played, it has cost us. The percentage was maybe 80 out of a 100 on execution. It has cost us and it's not the first game that we are giving away too many runs at the end. We just have to go out and work on our last 15 overs," said captain Elton Chigumbura after his side's loss to West Indies.On the other hand, Zimbabwe have had a roller-coaster ride so far in the tournament. While they ran South Africa close despite chasing a big total in their first game, they held their nerve to beat UAE in the second. However, in the third match, the Gaylestorm blew them completely away as the giant left-hander went on to record the first double-hundred in World Cup history. With just one win in three games, Zimbabwe will have to win almost all their remaining matches to stay alive in the tournament."I am very optimistic that they can win but if they don't they have to go back home early," warned former Pakistan skipper Wasim Akram after the loss to West Indies. Meanwhile, "I have not seen a more coward and selfish captain than Misbah. He is not willing to bat up the order to protect the other players at a time when he needs to show inspiration. He is happy with his own runs and I don't know what coach Waqar Younis wants. He has no game plan or direction for the team." said former Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Akhtar to a renowned news channel.The build up to this match has not been ideal for Pakistan. First, chief selector Moin Khan was sent home after admitting that he visited a casino in Christchurch ahead of the team's second Pool B game against West Indies. Then, a tweet supposedly from an official Younis Khan account said he was going to retire from ODIs after the World Cup and continue to play Tests, but Younis rubbished the news and claimed he did not have a Twitter account of his own.Pakistan did not have the best of starts to their 2015 World Cup campaign. With history against them, they took on India at the Adelaide Oval, but the pressure of the big game got the better of them as MS Dhoni's boys went on to beat them by a comfortable margin. Their performance in the second game, against West Indies, would hurt them even more. After a collective effort from the middle-order helped West Indies post 310, Pakistan were reduced to 1/4 in the 4th over and could never really keep up with the asking rate, before eventually losing the match by a whopping 150 runs.12:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: With two losses in two games so far, the pressure is immense on Pakistan, who are expected to qualify for the quarterfinals. With one more game left against a tough opponent, in South Africa, Misbah-ul-Haq and Co. would want to seal this fixture to have a bit of momentum behind them. Hello and a warm welcome to everyone. The action shifts to the Gabba in Brisbane today for this Pool B encounter between Pakistan and Zimbabwe. Preview: The Pool B ICC Cricket World Cup match against Zimbabwe on Sunday is Pakistan's big opportunity to set things right. From day one, parallels have been drawn between this edition and the one in 1992 when Pakistan went all the way despite a poor start. This time too, they have started off on the wrong foot following consecutive big defeats against India and West Indies. However, fans are hopeful that the team will do a repeat of what it did 23 years ago.Zimbabwe, who lost their matches against South Africa and West Indies, seem to be the right fodder for Pakistan. On paper, they are no match for Pakistan and the only hope they have is that the subcontinental team plays its worst cricket just like it did in the previous two matches.Date and start: March 1, 2015; 9 am ISTVenue: Woolloongabba, BrisbaneWeather: It's been forecasted to be partly cloudy with temperatures expected to vacillate between 21 and 31 degrees Celsius.Team NewsPakistanYounis Khan has come in for a lot of criticism due to a lack of contributions in the top order. Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq may sit him out and bring in Sarfraz Ahmed whose better wicketkeeping skills than those of Umar Akmal will be another asset. Yasir Shah is also likely to return in place of Nasir Jamshed.Probable XI 1 Ahmed Shehzad, 2 Younis Khan/Sarfraz Ahmed, 3 Haris Sohail, 4 Misbah-ul-Haq (capt), 5 Sohaib Maqsood, 6 Umar Akmal, 7 Shahid Afridi, 8 Wahab Riaz, 9 Yasir Shah, 10 Sohail Khan, 11 Mohammad Irfan.ZimbabweZimbabwe are unlikely to ring any changes. However, their batsmen will have to improve on their showing in the previous matches in light of the bouncy wicket at the Gabba.Probable XI: 1 Sikandar Raza, 2 Regis Chakabva, 3 Hamilton Masakadza, 4 Brendan Taylor (wk), 5 Sean Williams, 6 Craig Ervine, 7 Stuart Matsikenyeri, 8 Elton Chigumbura (capt), 9 Tinashe Panyangara, 10 Tendai Chatara, 11 Tafadzwa KamungoziPlayers to watch out for:Without any doubt, Wahab Riaz has been Pakistan's best bowler. Some chin music is certainly in store for the Zimbabwe batsmen on a pitch that brings out the best in fast bowlers. As for Zimbabwe, expect Brendan Taylor to get back among the runs. He has been average but if Zimbabwe are to surprise Pakistan, it's of great importance that he hits the ground running.Quotes:The important lesson is never give up. That's what you need to do as a player and as a team. That's what Imran Khan usually says about 1992. Even when the team was in difficult times, they never gave up: Misbah on his team's chances He [Whatmore] knows almost everyone on the team, so when it comes to strategies and stuff, it's much better to have someone who has worked with Pakistan guys. So we've got more information. We just have to go and execute our plans tomorrow: Chigumbura talking about the advantage coach Dav Whatmore, who has coached Pakistan in the past, brings to the teamStats and Trivia:1.Zimbabwe have a poor record against Pakistan, winning three and losing 42.
