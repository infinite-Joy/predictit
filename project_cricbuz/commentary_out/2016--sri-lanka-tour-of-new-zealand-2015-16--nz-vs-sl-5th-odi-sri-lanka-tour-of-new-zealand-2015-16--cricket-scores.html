Gunathilaka is on strike. Boult will open the attackA warm welcome back! Let's hope that the grim Sydney clouds don't come flirting to the Bay Oval. It's nice and sunny and Sri Lanka will want to square the series and make up for some of the Test humiliation. Boult has the new ball. Two slips.Just when the Kiwis were looking to cut loose, Guptill departed for 102. Taylor played well for his 61, Ronchi too hit a few boundaries but it was Santner's 11-ball 21 that got the hosts past 290. Kulasekara was the pick of the bowlers, taking 3/53 from his 10 overs. The series is on the line, there's a lot to play for. The pitch doesn't have any demons to trouble the batsmen, but can Sri Lanka chase this down? Or will New Zealand emerge victorious once again? Join us in some time to find out.The Black Caps will be reasonably happy with their performance today, but they would have probably expected a lot more runs towards the end. Apart from the last over from Pradeep, the Lankans hardly gave anything away in the final overs, executing their yorkers really well. Earlier, Latham departed in the first over but Guptill and Williamson (61) then put on a 122-run stand to lift the Black Caps. Williamson got out in an unlucky manner, but Guptill, along with Taylor, added 81 runs for the third wicket to keep the pressure on the visitors. The tall opener also got to his 10th ODI hundred during that phase.4

Ish Sodhi retains his place. McClenaghan misses out as Boult comes in. For Sri Lanka, Pradeep replaces Vandersay. The conditions are a bit overcast (no rain expected though) and the Lankans probably feel that they will get the most out of this wicket with a pacer instead of a leg spinner.Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldSri Lanka might also make one or two changes, depending on what the pitch has to offer. Angelo Mathews' men will be buoyed by their performance in the third ODI, and will be hoping that they can end the ODI leg of the tour on a positive note. The toss and the teams are not far away. Stay tuned.Hello and a warm welcome to one and all. Brendon McCullum is still struggling with a back injury; he has been ruled out of today's fixture and he also won't feature in the T20Is. He is only expected to return to the side for the ODIs against Pakistan (starting January 25). Tim Southee is also out with a foot injury, but the hosts will be boosted by the return of Trent Boult, who was rested for the first four games. With Doug Bracewell too getting a break, the Kiwis might go in with four pacers today - Boult, McClenaghan, Milne and Henry.After the Black Caps raced away to a 2-0 lead in the series, Sri Lanka pulled one back at Nelson while the fourth ODI was washed out with rain playing spoilsport. That brings us here, to the series decider between New Zealand and Sri Lanka at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui. No matter what's the end result today, New Zealand can't lose the series. Only if the visitors manage to win, they will draw the series and if the hosts emerge as winners, they will take the series 3-1. Preview: When New Zealand are on song they are destructive. England found that out in the World Cup last year and Sri Lanka had to face the same wrath in the first two One-Day Internationals (ODI) of the five-match series.Sri Lanka won the third game and the fourth game was washed out due to heavy rain and the visitors couldn't have hoped for a better chance to level the series when they take on injury-hit New Zealand in the final game of the series at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui on Tuesday(January 5).New Zealand will be without Brendon McCullum and Tim Southee, both out with injuries. McCullum hasn't recovered from the back injury he suffered during the second game and Southee is nursing a foot injury. However, Trent Boult will walk into the playing XI after he was rested for the first four games. Doug Bracewell has been rested and will make way for Boult."He certainly won't be playing in this game, and he's probably unlikely in the T20Is, but we'll know a bit more tomorrow," Hesson said about Southee. "There's nothing major, it's just a matter of time. It was really unfortunate he got injured because he's certainly been one of our better-performing one-day bowlers but we've got to be a bit cautious, especially with the summer we've got ahead."Kane Williamson will lead in McCullum's absence. If injuries to key players is something that'll give Sri Lanka some respite, New Zealand's history at the venue would please them more. The hosts have played two games at the venue and have lost both.However, history is something that hardly bothers the players. The kind of form New Zealand have shown and especially the way that a number of players like Martin Guptill, Matt Henry and Mitchell McClenaghan have stepped up, Sri Lanka have a tough task ahead of them.Hesson felt New Zealand need to come up with better performances with the bat though they scored 276, batting first for the first time in the series. "We played well in two-and-a-half of the three-and-a-half games really, and to be fair we didn't play well and still got 276 in Nelson," he said. "It wasn't a poor performance, but it certainly wasn't a good one with the bat and I think we're better than that."Sri Lanka haven't won a series in New Zealand since 2001 and their hopes of winning a series were dashed when the fourth game was washed out just after nine overs. However, there were quite a few positives from the game as they reduced New Zealand to 75 for 3, having bagged the Top 3 - Guptill, Williamson and Tom Latham.Though New Zealand have scored at a brisk pace and have kept the Sri Lankan bowlers under the pump, it has been the batting that has let them down this series. They were able to manage just 188 and 117 in the first two games before Lahiru Thirimanne and Tillakaratne Dilshan got going in the third ODI.The onus will be on Danushka Gunathilaka and Milinda Siriwardana to play around the established players like Dilshan, Angelo Matthews and Thirimanne. Gunathilaka looked really promising in the third game when he hammered 65 off 45 to give the visitors a solid platform.With weather not expected to play a part, Sri Lanka have a very good chance to level the series against a depleted New Zealand side. However, the hosts have enough fire-power in their arsenal to clinch the series making it an evenly matched contest.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Danushka Gunathilaka, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dushmantha Chameera, Jeffrey Vandersay, Nuwan Pradeep, Thisara Perera, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Kithuruwan Vithanage, Sachithra SenanayakeNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Ish Sodhi, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, George Worker, Doug BracewellLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
