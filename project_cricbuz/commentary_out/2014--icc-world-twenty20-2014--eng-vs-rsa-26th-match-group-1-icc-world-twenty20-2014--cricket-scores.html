The South African media manager, Mr. Mohammad Moosajee has some sharp words with the 4th umpire, Aleem Dar, but the ground-staff are indeed mopping up the dew. The rules state that the same procedure needs to be followed when it is South Africa's turn with the ball, so we might well have another round of mopping up 10 balls into England's innings.Looks like the umpires are taking the players off. We are in for a delay here. As I type, one or two bulbs have started flickering back.Oops! The lights have gone off again. This happened at Sylhet previously and now it is the turn of Chittagong.

The outfield is quite wet already, the surface is still good for batting, reckons Shaun PollockTeams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, David Miller, Albie Morkel, Dale Steyn, Beuran Hendricks, Wayne Parnell, Imran TahirEngland (Playing XI): Michael Lumb, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad(c), James Tredwell, Jade DernbachAB: "Faf plays a huge role in our side but we'll miss him today, but we are ready to go as a team. We were looking to bowl first but we'll make our win so special coming from the other way around. We have a bunch of great players and we have full confidence in us. It's a big game for us tonight. Tsotsboe sits out for Parnell and Behardien replaces Faf"Broad: "We had an impressive win the other night. Obviously the bowling has to improve but we take a lot of positives out of that game. We've got to be better. We're gonna have a bowl again, happy with that. The dew does take effect but we would like to make good use of the new ball. We are unchanged."England have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe Proteas though, have been dealt a massive blow even before the game as their skipper Faf du Plessis has been banned for one match due to his side's slow over-rate in the game against Netherlands. The batting form of JP Duminy and Hashim Amla at the top of the order comes as a delight for South Africa while the bowling unit, led by Dale Steyn and Imran Tahir is doing very well to please the team management. We saw in the England-Sri Lanka game that the dew played a big part in making life difficult for the bowlers in the second innings. Will it play a major role tonight as well? We'll find out that and more as the game progresses. Toss coming up in a short while. Stay tuned...Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan won the game for England against Sri Lanka with a sensational partnership a couple of days ago. However, with those dropped catches and a couple of noughts at the top of the order, skipper Stuart Broad wasn't entirely happy with his team's performance. Can they pull up their socks and play well as a unit tonight? Hello and a warm welcome to what is anticipated to be a cracking contest between England and South Africa.PreviewSouth Africa have the opportunity to seal a semi-final spot in the World T20 when they take on England in a Group 1 league game in Chittagong later tonight. After a narrow defeat to Sri Lanka, the Proteas have bounced back well to register wins against New Zealand and Netherlands, albeit scratchy and edgy.England meanwhile, with two points from two games are on the brink of elimination despite a sensational assault from Alex Hales that drowned Sri Lanka earlier this week. It has been an unfortunate tournament for Stuart Broad's men so far with their game against New Zealand being decided by the D/L method after rain interrupted.South Africa captain Faf du Plessis will miss the vital clash after being banned for his side's slow over-rates, providing a timely warning for opposite number Stuart Broad. Star batsman AB de Villiers will step in for du Plessis as skipper for the game against England.Du Plessis was handed a one-game ban by the International Cricket Council after match referee David Boon ruled South Africa fell one over short in their allotted time during Thursday's narrow success over Holland - a second such offence in a 12-month period.Du Plessis, an important batsman and crack fielder as well as on-field leader, will be a big loss and raise England's hopes of staying alive in the tournament.But they must also take heed of Du Plessis' fate after Broad was also penalised by Boon.England were judged to be two overs behind the required rate in their thrilling victory over Sri Lanka but, as a first offence, Broad was handed only a fine comprising 40 per cent of his match fee.Any further transgression in the tournament would see England suffer the same punishment as Du Plessis and leave Broad to watch his team-mates from the sidelines.As it is, the 27-year-old is starting to harbour thoughts of an unlikely success at a tournament that England entered in what seemed a chronic downward spiral.Alex Hales' dashing 116 not out against Sri Lanka made him the country's first international T20 centurion and breathed unexpected life into England's challenge in Bangladesh.Now Broad is hoping to harness that energy and become challengers for the main prize."T20 is a momentum game and the innings we chased against Sri Lanka was one of the best I've ever witnessed," he said."The confidence and belief we will get from that going into our final two group games is going to be huge. It's in our hands a little bit now."If we had lost against Sri Lanka we were pretty much out of the World Cup. With that sort of pressure, it's exciting to see players come through that."We have got two group games left and we're very confident we can do well in those."We know what these tournaments are like, if you can get on a run, if you can get a few guys going you can win these tournaments and it's not out of our grasp."The only downside of Thursday's restorative six-wicket success was a series of missed chances in the field, with four dropped catches and one botched run out making life harder than it had to be.Coach Ashley Giles responded by ordering evening fielding practice in Chittagong, putting his charges through their paces under lights and in dewy conditions.Teams:England (From): Michael Lumb, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad(c), Tim Bresnan, Jade Dernbach, Chris Jordan, Ian Bell, Chris Woakes, James Tredwell, Stephen Parry, Craig KieswetterSouth Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, David Miller, Albie Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Beuran Hendricks, Aaron PhangisoLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
