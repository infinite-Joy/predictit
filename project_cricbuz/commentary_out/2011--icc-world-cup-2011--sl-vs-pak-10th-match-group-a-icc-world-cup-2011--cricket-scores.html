SRI LANKA:49.5  Gul to Kulasekara, out Caught by Umar Akmal!! If there was a slight hope, it would have been put to rest now. Kulasekara swings a full toss, how far does it go?

SRI LANKA:45.4 Akhtar to Perera, 2 runs, It is like one of those crazy nerve-wracking dreams! That should have been taken at short fine leg, Akthar slipped in the slower ball bouncer, Perera miscued the pull and Younis Khan running backwards got both hands to it, but could not hold on as the ball slipped out of his grasp.

SRI LANKA:39.1  Afridi to Mathews, no run, total misunderstanding, total chaos! Mathews tapped it to the on side, Silva set off for a single, he was half way down when he was sent back, Silva slips but Kamran had to run forward to his left and then fire in a throw, he does not hit the stumps direct, Silva is safe!

SRI LANKA:38.4  Rehman to Mathews, no run, that was a terrific delivery from Rehman, pitched on middle and off, turned away from Mathews, there was a faint sound as the ball passed Mathews, but replays were inconclusive, not sure whether the ball took the bat or the back leg, not given! The ICC's decision to have UDRS despite not having hot-spot and snicko is quite debatable.No snicko, no hot-spot, no point in seeing the replays again and again. The keeper's reaction was spontaneous, but the evidence is not conclusive.A loud appeal from the bowler, the Pakistanis appeal for caught-behind, the square leg umpire was nodding his head, but it was given not-out.

The batsman in question is Sangakkara. Are Pakistan panicking here? It looks like Sanga is safe. The original decision is not out.

SRI LANKA:14.2  Hafeez to Tharanga, out Caught by Afridi at cover!! Tharanga has gotten too overconfident after that last late cut and has thrown it away. A fine little opening stand ends. Tossed up delivery on the stumps, Tharanga created room to split the gap through a packed off side field. A soft dismissal as the drive finds Afridi who took a sharp catch and then roars in delight. He is surrounded by his excited team-mates. Pakistan needed that and now we have a game on. Enter Sanga. Tharanga c Afridi b Hafeez 33(43) [4s-6] Hafeez to Tharanga, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:14.1  Hafeez to Tharanga, FOUR!!, the fielder slipped but it would have beaten him in any case and the Lankan skipper claps from the dressing room, cut away from the stumps, Tharanga is confident that he won't miss those that he arches back and makes room to late cut it wide of point, terrific timing and placement

SRI LANKA:11.5  Gul to Dilshan, 5 wides, Afridi lets out a cry of anguish as the free hit will stay after Gul fires in a rip roaring bouncer, Dilshan and Akmal both had no chance, maybe Joel Garner standing on top of Kamran Akmal's head would have had a chance
SRI LANKA:11.5  Gul to Dilshan, no ball, the pressure is telling on both Dilshan and Gul, Gul oversteps and it is driven wide of mid off, there was an easy single, confusion between the two and they don't take the single, would have been disastrous for SL if there was a run-out off a no-ball, free hit coming up
SRI LANKA:11.4  Gul to Dilshan, FOUR!!, Gul isn't impressed by all this, a poor ball too, short and wide outside off, allowing Dilshan to have a free swing, the thick edge flies well over a leaping YK at 1st slip, the extra pace of Gul is allowing Dilshan to gain some momentum after he had an ordinary beginning

SRI LANKA:10.6  Hafeez to Tharanga, FOUR!!, he plays those late cuts really well, the previous time he had missed out as the ball kept low, this time makes room and gets on top of the bounce to cut it away past backward point, 1000 ODI runs in SL for Tharanga who has made 9 ODI tons already

SRI LANKA:8.5  Akhtar to Dilshan, FOUR!!, Akhtar is shocked to see that run away to the fence, the fielder at third man was too wide and the upper cut from Dilshan beat him easily, short and wide outside off, flashed to the left of Razzaq and it went away

SRI LANKA:8.1  Akhtar to Dilshan, no run, beaten, Dilshan is rooted to the crease and tries to knife it on the up, the ball straightened and zoomed past the edgeMisbah-ul-Haq is off the field. When he was batting, he had a runner. He is suffering from cramps and Shafiq is on the field for him. Wasim Akram on air isn't happy with Afridi's constant talks with his bowlers. He says he needs to let the experienced bowlers set their own fields and not advise them every ball.
SRI LANKA:7.6  Gul to Tharanga, no run, slower delivery on off stump, Tharanga gets forward and defends it to backward point
SRI LANKA:7.5  Gul to Tharanga, no run, pacy and lifting delivery outside off, Tharanga flashes at that late, attempting to steer it late, the ball flies past the edge and beats him, thuds into Akmal's gloves

SRI LANKA:5.4  Razzaq to Dilshan, no run, this time, he bottom edges the cut, tried to hit that too hard
SRI LANKA:5.3  Razzaq to Dilshan, FOUR!!, Afridi removed a slip a couple of balls ago for Razzaq and where does the ball go? To the lone slip and it would have been catching practice, a thick edge as Dilshan went after a fuller length delivery outside off, consecutive boundaries for Dilshan and now Afridi walks up to Razzaq, tries to gee him up, by clapping vociferously
SRI LANKA:5.2  Razzaq to Dilshan, FOUR!!, That's Dilshan's area and strength, knifed the good length delivery on the up and Afridi is not happy with his bowler, smoothly on the up and Dilshan found a way past a host of off side men, those fast hands of Dilshan doing the trick, stands tall and belts the ball like Sehwag
SRI LANKA:5.1  Razzaq to Dilshan, no run, full and on the stumps, driven down to mid on

SRI LANKA:3.3  Razzaq to Dilshan, 1 run, the slash from Dilshan this time, short and wide outside off, he flashed at it, Rehman at third man is not quite where he should have been according to Razzaq and it lands in front of him, Razzaq lets out a cry of anguish at the fielder, who responds saying that he could not hear the call of 'catch'
SRI LANKA:3.2  Razzaq to Dilshan, no run, good length delivery on off stump, Dilshan presses forward and then blocks
SRI LANKA:3.1  Razzaq to Dilshan, no run, fine fine delivery that from Razzaq, Dilshan planted his front foot forward and tried to knife it on the rise as he always does, but the late seam movement does Dilshan in, very close to the outside edge

SRI LANKA:2.3  Akhtar to Tharanga, 1 run, this time Tharanga gets on top of the short ball, opens the face on that and glides it down to square third man, Tharanga made sure that he did not fend at it once again
SRI LANKA:2.2  Akhtar to Tharanga, no run, nicely punched off the front-foot to mid off
SRI LANKA:2.1  Akhtar to Tharanga, FOUR!!, pace can hurt and this time it has hurt Akhtar, Tharanga was definitely done for pace and he fended at the short of length delivery awkwardly away from his body, the thick outer edge flew over the slip cordon and gave third man no chance
SRI LANKA:1.6  Razzaq to Dilshan, no run, very good MAIDEN OVER!! from Razzaq, nothing special, just good old honest decent disciplined bowling, on a good length on off stump, Dilshan blocks
SRI LANKA:1.5  Razzaq to Dilshan, no run, good length delivery on off stump, Dilshan defends it towards cover
SRI LANKA:1.4  Razzaq to Dilshan, no run, Dilshan is not ready to pull that, it hurried onto him and cramped him for room, bottom edged it onto his pad

SRI LANKA:1.2  Razzaq to Dilshan, no run, this one swung back in towards Dilshan's pads, he edged his flick onto his left leg, Dilshan is itching to get after Razzaq, but Razzaq will bowl wicket to wicket and give nothing away

SRI LANKA:0.2  Akhtar to Tharanga, 1 run, Akhtar has a wry smile at Tharanga after a thickish edge flies through where a gully would have been, no man in that position and Tharanga gets off the mark, he opened the face, but it still took the edge
SRI LANKA:0.1  Akhtar to Tharanga, no run, back of a length delivery on middle and Tharanga gets right behind the line to defend, no swing or seam movement in that first ball from Akhtar, Akhtar will begin steadily and then increase his pace as the over goes onTharanga and Dilshan are at the crease. Tharanga is on strike. Akhtar will open the attackWe are all ready and set to go for the chase. The Lankan openers are out and the Rawalpindi Express - Shoaib Akhtar marks out his run-up. He looks a lot leaner and fitter. Afridi has a word with him. Can he bowl quick and nip out a couple under lights? A couple of slips for Akhtar and an orthodox field apart from that. Once again, it will be Srivathsa to bring you the first 15 overs. Remember SL have never won a game against Pakistan in WCs.Sri Lankan chase: Only twice has been a total of more than 250 been successfully chased on this ground. Can Sri Lanka make it 3? Or will Pakistan register their 2nd win in a row? If Sri Lanka win, then they would have had the privilege of chasing down the highest ever total on this. The previous best was 271/2 by India against England in the Champions Trophy in 2002. That night Sehwag and Ganguly both got tons and put the English bowlers to the sword. Ok. Enough of this number crunching.Pakistan were off to a fast start despite losing wickets at regular periods of time. The cool heads of Misbah and Younis ensured that Pakistan entered the slog overs with a healthy total on board. SL did fight back into the contest thanks to their spinners who maintained a tight line and length. Murali proved why he was still a tough nut to crack especially during the batting Powerplay where he tied batsmen of the calibre of Umar Akmal and Afridi in knots. Afridi said during the toss that he would happily take anything around 270 and that is what Pakistan has managed. SL do have a good batting order, but they will be tested under lights. Do join us in a short while for the Lankan chase.Younis Khan: It is a good score, we need to bowl and field well. We should have got ten to fifteen runs more but we have a good bowling line up. Plan will be to bowl them out.Afridi at the toss said, he will take anything between 270-280 with the kind of bowling line up that they possess. Will they better the hosts this time around?4

They waited for a while to see the replays and then sent Hafeez on his way back as Kamran Akmal had crossed him by then. Funnily both the batsmen were not talking even as Younis Khan came in to bat. One of the more interesting dismissals you will see in ODI cricket or any form of cricket. Hafeez run out (Sangakkara/Muralitharan) 32(31) [4s-4 6s-1] Muralitharan to Hafeez, THATS OUT!!

PAKISTAN:4.2  Kulasekara to Shehzad, 2 runs, Wonderful cricket all-round, Shehzad stands up on his toes and punches it wide of mid off, Mathews runs after it like a Tiger and then slides back to keep it to a couple, only the athletic Mathews could have stopped that as the ball was racing away

PAKISTAN:1.3  Perera to Shehzad, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, square driven wide of deep backward point, for a couple
PAKISTAN:1.2  Perera to Shehzad, FOUR!!, At the beginning of an innings there should be two slips at least and SL do not and they pay the price for that, if there was one then Shehzad could well have been walking back, full and wide outside off, edged through the 2nd slip region, Shehzad threw the bat at it and got lucky, now a 2nd slip comes in, is it too late?

PAKISTAN:0.4  Kulasekara to Shehzad, FOUR!!, Shehzad has seen that it is doing nothing off the straight and moves across to off stump, shuffles down the wicket too at the same time and then flays it on the up past the off side field, terrific timing as the ball raced away to deep extra cover, good start for Shehzad and Pakistan
PAKISTAN:0.3  Kulasekara to Shehzad, no run, back of a length outside off, Shehzad pushes it from the crease to the off side
PAKISTAN:0.2  Kulasekara to Shehzad, no run, beaten, back of a length outside off, straightened a tad, Shehzad tried to force it on the up, again the ball did not carry to Sanga, just about beat the bat, this is a low and slow pitch
PAKISTAN:0.1  Kulasekara to Shehzad, no run, Oh! That kept really low, only a lone slip as Shehzad shoulders arms to a good length delivery outside off, the ball really did not bounce and died on it's way to the keeperShehzad and Hafeez are at the crease. Shehzad is on strike. Kulasekara will open the attackDaryl Harper says let's play and we are ready to go. Kulasekara marks out his run-up. This will be Srivathsa, who will be starting off the commentary.Muralitharan: It is just another game, but the World Cup is special. There are still a lot of games to go and we need to reach the quaterfinals. The tracks in SL will be slow and it will turn. I can still perform even though I am 38 years old.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Angelo Mathews, Chamara Silva, Nuwan Kulasekara, Thissara Perera, Rangana Herath, Muttiah MuralitharanPakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Shoaib Akhtar, Umar GulAkhtar: Never had a doubt about my comeback, people had lost hopes on me but I always backed myself. I am very patriotic, I love the star on my shirt and that will drive me to perform well. I have trained hard, feeling very fit, I am in the right shape and hopefully I will be furious today. We like to top the table, we want to perform and win every game.No Malinga? That's surprising, rather shocking to me. He would have certainly made a difference.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to batSangakkra: It is a World Cup game, the pressure comes in with it but we are chilled out. Chamara Silva and Herath are coming in place of Kapugedera and Mendis.Afridi: We are batting first, not really nervous. Every game will be associated with pressure but we are feeling good, the morale is quite high. The batsmen know that this is a good batting wicket, we would like to put a good total. We are going in with the same team. 270-280 will be a good total with the kind of bowling line up we have.Pitch report: The wicket was re-layed a couple of months ago. We haven't had an international game here since two years. There are a lot of cracks in the wicket and the wicket may get slower as the game progresses. Lots of runs in store. The captain who wins the toss would look to bat first.Yesterday's big game - Australia v New Zealand - turned out to be lopsided. Let's hope that we get to see a cracker of a contest today as the two of the three sub continent giants - Sri Lanka and Pakistan - lock horns at Colombo. Both teams are coming out of massive wins against the minnows and this game will surely be the one to look out for. This is Ajith and I will take you through the day along with Pradeep, Sid V and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be right back.by Saurabh SomaniOf all the matches in the World Cup, Sri Lanka versus Pakistan will perhaps be the most poignant one. The dynamics between the two teams changed forever - as they did for world cricket - on March 3 2009, when the Sri Lankan team was attacked by terrorists in Pakistan. That their match is just a week away from the second anniversary of the attack makes it more poignant.
Even without the history, the match would have been very significant. It is the start of the so-called 'Super Weekend', featuring two heavyweight clashes, and the Sri Lanka-Pakistan match will have a significant bearing on the final standings in Group A.Team NewsSri Lanka: Sri Lanka have started their campaign in a manner worthy of one of the title-favourites. True, the match was against Canada, but the comprehensive nature of the victory gave pointers of a side that was in form and confident of itself. Sri Lanka's top-order of Dilshan, Tharanga, Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene resembles a fortress, especially at home. It will require a special bowling effort from any opposition to restrict them and get them out cheaply. Their only point of worry is the middle-order, which doesn't seem to pack anywhere near the fire-power of the top order. The bowling is possibly the most penetrating and covers all the bases - they have variety, they have the ability to take wickets, they have the X-factor. In Lasith Malinga, they have possibly the world's foremost limited-overs bowler, and he is expected to be fit for the clash after missing the one against Canada. The match is happening at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, on which Sri Lanka has enjoyed considerable success. They have won 28 matches and lost just 16 since 1st January 2000.Pakistan: Pakistan are the true dark horses of the 2011 World Cup. Their combustible nature means they are not going to be firm favourites, since they are as likely to implode as to inflict a heavy defeat on the opposition. They also opened with a very convincing win against Kenya - another minnow - and will be confident. However, with Pakistan, there is always a rider going into the match: it seems forever since they went into any international match without the shadow of a recent controversy. And with that hanging over their head, there will always be occasions when Pakistan will not be able to perform at full potential. The thing is, no one knows when the controversies will unite Pakistan and when they will divide Pakistan. Pakistan's immediate problem is their opening pair, who struggled against the modest Kenyan attack. Their bowling is in safe hands, with Shoaib Akhtar and Umar Gul being the strike weapons, and Shahid Afridi always a threat. Pakistan will also take heart from the performance of their middle order, who all scored fifties against Kenya.Head to Head:Pakistan has never lost a World Cup match to Sri Lanka. However, in a startling statistic, the last time these two teams met in a World Cup match was way back in 1992, when Pakistan won the cup.Trivia:In the terrorist attack of March 2009, Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar was in the minivan that was behind the team bus. The driver of the minivan tragically lost his life in the attacks. Aleem Dar, however, gives a portion of his salary every month to the family of the driver.
There is no particular reason for this piece of trivia to be a part of this preview, except to show that in great tragedy, great humanity is also possible; and to commemorate the occasion with the two teams playing each other so close to the anniversary of the attack.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Thilan Samaraweera, Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Muttiah Muralitharan, Dilhara Fernando, Rangana Herath, Thissara Perera, Chamara SilvaPakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Shoaib Akhtar, Umar Gul, Asad Shafiq, Saeed Ajmal, Wahab Riaz, Junaid KhanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
