All the batsmen got starts but none went on to convert it into a big one. Faf du Plessis came back into form after a string of low scores. He looked good till his fifty before throwing it away. Duminy struggled early on but battled his way to an ODI fifty. The Pakistan bowlers were once again led by the No. 1 ODI bowler Ajmal who kept things tight and picked up two wickets. He was well supported by Afridi who picked up wickets and was economical in the middle overs. Pakistan batsmen have to show more fight than what they have in the previous matches, if they have to pull this one off. Join us back in a few minutes for the run chase.....4

But nothing too serious as he will rest for one or two weeks.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, AB de Villiers(c), Faf du Plessis, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Imran TahirPakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Asad Shafiq, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Amin, Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Sohail Tanvir, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Mohammad IrfanMisbah: "We would have batted first as well. It does not matter, it looks like a good wicket. We have one change Asad Shafiq comes in for Nasir Jamshed. Yes, we did well in the last match but today is a new day. We are always under pressure when you play a team like South Africa."de Villiers: "We are gone to have a bat first. There is not much of a difference whether we bat first or second. There is some pressure on batting so would like to put that straight today. Smith has some injury, don't know what it is called exactly. So he misses out, Amla and Steyn return to the squad."South Africa have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "The surface looks beautiful and even. There is very little grass on the wicket. It is a very different pitch to the one in Sharjah or Dubai. The batsmen will enjoy batting on this wicket. The average score batting first is 251. So, win the toss and bat first", says Kepler Wessels.Hello and welcome to the third ODI in Abu Dhabi. The series is level at 1-1 and both teams will be looking to take the lead. Pakistan came back well to win the second match after losing a thriller in the first one. It was their bowlers who did an excellent job to defend a small total and get them home. The batsmen would have to contribute more, if they have to go on to win the series. The South African team has struggled to face the spin trio and have not scored 200 in both the matches. But the batting will be bolstered with the return of Amla. The bowling department will also see their spearhead Steyn return. It will be interesting to see whose place Steyn will take. Stay tuned for the toss and teams....South African batsman Jean-Paul Duminy said star performer Hashim Amla's return will be a big bonus for South Africa in the third one-day international against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. Amla, ranked second in Test batsmen rankings, left for home to attend the birth of his second child after the first of two Tests in the series which ended 1-1.He missed the first two one-days - won each by South Africa and Pakistan -- before joining the squad on Sunday, despite the delay in the birth. Duminy hoped Amla gives good starts to South Africa who were shot out for 183 and 143 in the one-day matches."Hashim's return is a bonus but there's no guarantee that he will come and score runs. He's probably given us the best starts in the ODI format - he's the best in the world - so it's great to have him back," Duminy said after training on Monday."There's no pressure on him as he brings a lot of experience to the team and it's always great to have him. Hopefully he can contribute to our batting performance." Besides Amla, the return of pace spearhead Dale Steyn will also bolster South African bowling. Steyn had left for home to rest after the second Test. Duminy admitted facing Pakistani slow bowlers on spin-friendly pitches was a big challenge. "It is arguably one of the best bowling attacks in one-day cricket at the moment. It's just about making sure we have good game plans in place and working in partnerships out there and knowing you are not alone," said Duminy.South Africa lost their first wicket for nought and seven in the two games, wickets which put them under pressure. "When you're losing wickets early upfront you're always catching up with the game from a batting perspective. A lot of us including myself have got in, to 20s and 30s and got out," said Duminy who had scores of 20 and 25 in two matches. "We've done the business in the past - its just about making sure we back ourselves to do it again." Duminy hoped all the players do their best to turn the series in South Africa's favour. "Look we're obviously in a tight position, but it's not the end of the world. We haven't had two great performances with the bat and I guess everybody would be thinking that is our worrying factor right now which is probably true. But we've got to stand up and be accountable for it as a batting unit," said Duminy. The fourth match will also be played in Abu Dhabi on Friday while the fifth and final will be held in Sharjah on November 11. The two teams will also play two Twenty20 internationals in Dubai on November 11 and 13.Teams:Pakistan (From): Nasir Jamshed, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Amin, Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Sohail Tanvir, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Mohammad Irfan, Abdur Rehman, Junaid Khan, Asad Shafiq, Sarfraz Ahmed, Sohaib MaqsoodSouth Africa (From): Graeme Smith, Colin Ingram, Jean-Paul Duminy, AB de Villiers(w/c), Faf du Plessis, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Imran Tahir, Robin Peterson, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Quinton de KockLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
