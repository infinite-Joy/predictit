Facing one of the best attacks will be no easy thing.Afghanistan bowlers were discplied in their line and lengths. They had done an excellent job before Akmal started going after them. All the bowlers chipped in and were well supported in the field. It is now upto their batsmen to chase down this target and cause an upset. Will they be able to achieve that or will the Pakistan bowlers run through their batting line-up? Join us in a short while to find out....A brilliant recovery from Pakistan. After being 117 for 6 at one stage, they ended up with 248 in their 50 overs. Akmal carried his form from the last match and played one of his best innings. He started off in a cautious manner as he saw wickets tumbling at the other end. But, once he was set he unleashed himself on the bowlers with some incredible shots. He got to his 2nd ODI ton, one which has given his team something to bowl at. Anwar Ali and Umar Gul supported him as they added 60 and 40 runs respectively for the 7th and 8th wicket.4

Bilawal Bhatti is not playing and Anwar Ali comes in. Told the boys that we should not make the mistakes what we did in the last match. We saw the last match between India and Bangladesh, it was a good wicket to bat first on."Nabi: "It is our first experience in the Asia Cup. We have been playing together for 7 to 8 years, so we are looking forward to this match."Afghanistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldPakistan did not have a perfect start to their campaign. They lost the match in which they were under control, losing their last 6 wickets for 42 runs and handing Sri Lanka the victory. However, they should fancy their chance of getting the first points on board today. Will they make any changes to the side that played the last game? Toss and teams coming up in a bit....Hello and welcome to the 3rd match in the Asia Cup. The minnows Afghanistan take on Pakistan. It will be the first time that Afghanistan will be playing this tournament. After having a successful run against the associate teams they will now play against the big boys. Some of their players play in the Bangladesh local leagues, which should help them know the conditions better. Will they be able to cope with the pressures of playing against the big teams? We will find out soon enough.PreviewAfghanistan have a great chance to test their skills against the big boys of international cricket when they take on defending champions, Pakistan in their Asia Cup opener. Having qualified for the World T20 and the World Cup, Afghanistan would be keen to get a feel of high pressure games against quality opponents.Pakistan meanwhile would like to get some valuable points on the board after heart-breaking loss to Sri Lanka in the first match of the tournament. However, they would know that Afghanistan are no walk-overs, so a complacent approach might well backfire.Afghanistan: The latest team to emerge from Asia have shown they have the mettle and the aptitude to do well on the big stage. Some impressive performances against other Associate nations have put the strife-torn country on the radar and players like Mohammad Nabi, the captain, Nawroz Mangal and Asghar Stanikzai have been impressive in their brief international stint so far and could well be dangerous if they click together and lead from the front.The likes of Zimbabwe and Bangladesh have often upset more powerful sides and Nabi would like his side to draw inspiration from some of the great upheavals of the past and give Pakistan a run for their money.Pakistan: Another typically Pakistani performance saw the team slide to a narrow loss against Sri Lanka. They kept the Lankans to less than 300 but floundered their chase badly after Lasith Malinga produced some gems to to stop them short by 12 runs.The defending champions will need to stamp their authority on Afghanistan before their big ticket clash against arch-rivals India and Misbah-ul-Haq would hope that his players take their game to the next level by Sunday.Teams:Afghanistan (From): Mohammad Nabi(c), Asghar Stanikzai, Dawlat Zadran, Najibullah Zadran, Shapoor Zadran, Noor Ali Zadran, Fazal Niazai, Hamid Hassan, Hamza Hotak, Karim Sadiq, Mirwais Ashraf, Mohammad Shahzad(w), Nawroz Mangal, Rahmat Shah, Samiullah ShenwariPakistan (From): Sharjeel Khan, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sohaib Maqsood, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Bilawal Bhatti, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Junaid Khan, Anwar Ali, Fawad Alam, Mohammad Talha, Abdur RehmanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
