Length delivery that left the right-hander a touch, Anwar closed the bat face too early as he perhaps tried to nudge it around the corner. He could only eke out a leading edge to Mahmudullah at backward point who dives to his left and snaffles it with two hands. It has to go down as one of the catches of the tournament. Shaiman Anwar c Mahmudullah b Mortaza 1(4)Mortaza to Shaiman Anwar, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:5.4 Al-Amin to Shahzad, SIX, now, that was a meaty blow from Shahzad. He is a powerful lad for sure. With poise and balance, Shahzad lofts a fuller length delivery straight down the ground and it clears the boundary rope with ease

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:4.6 Mortaza to Rohan Mustafa, out Caught by Mustafizur Rahman!! Another one bites the dust. Mustafa too attempted to slog and lost his wicket. Mustafa makes room to a length delivery and could only get a thickish outside edge to short third man, who sets under it and snaffles it with two hands.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:3.4 Mustafizur Rahman to Rohan Mustafa, no run, Rahman has taken a splendid return catch. The crowd roars in delight. Wait! The umpire is checking whether his front foot is fine. He looks fine there. Now, they are checking whether he took it cleanly. Hmm, now that is touch and go. He lands on the back of his palm and when he went down did the ball touch the ground? Was his body still moving when the ball hit the turf? Now, that is the question mark. Holy moly! Mustafa has been called back and he escapes. I think it was the right decision in the end as when he tumbled and the ball touched the ground, he had not yet completed the catch. His body was still moving. It was an off-cutter from Rahman, Mustafa is surprised by it as he tries to push it towards mid-off. He gets it high on the bat, the bowler himself runs to his right and seemed to have snaffled it with both hands. On replays, given not out

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:1.3 Al-Amin to Muhammad Kaleem, out Caught by Mortaza!! UAE's batsmen just don't seem to learn from their mistakes as Kaleem takes the walk back to the hutch. Nothing but a good length delivery that was bowled just outside off, Kaleem attempted to drag it from there and slog it over the fielder at mid-on. However, Mortaza, the captain, took a step or two to his left and snaffled an easy catch. Muhammad Kaleem c Mortaza b Al-Amin 0(5)Al-Amin to Muhammad Kaleem, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

Back of a length delivery that was slanted across the left-hander, Mustafa prods forward and is surprised by the extra bounce. He ekes out an outside edge to Sarkar at second slip, but he did not even look at the ball. Despite getting hands on it, he drops it. The duo pinch a single, too
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.2 Taskin Ahmed to Rohan Mustafa, no run, what was Mustafa trying there? Mustafa charges down the track to convert it into a length ball and looks for a wild hoick across the line and misses. He lost the shape of the shot too early there
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:0.1 Taskin Ahmed to Rohan Mustafa, no run, back of a length delivery and outside off, Mustafa ignores. Now that delivery thudded into the keeper's glovesRohan Mustafa and Muhammad Kaleem are at the crease. Rohan Mustafa is on strike. Taskin Ahmed will open the attackTaskin has the new cherry in his hand. He has two slips in placeBangladesh's players are out in the middle. Can UAE upset the apple-cart and cross the finish line? Or will the hosts register their first victory of the tournament? It won't be easy as the track is darting around.Heath Streak: "We are going to have to bowl well. Yeah, I think everyone will have to play their part, including the fielders. We cannot afford dropped chances. It has been great, youngsters like Taskin and Mustafizur, Mashrafe brings in the experience."It was Mithun who pinched singles and twos, and twinned it with the odd boundary to keep the scorecard ticking. However, he was run-out in rather curious circumstances. Shakib Al Hasan tried to pilot a recovery, but he was chugged down. In the last over, Mahmudullah then cracked a few lusty blows to give the bowlers something to defend. On the other hand, Naveed and Javed bowled with unremitting control for the UAE. But their fielding was not exactly up to the standards as they dropped quite a few chances. Join us in a while for UAE's innings..Mohammad Mithun's well-constructed knock of 47, ensured the hosts finished with a decent total. On a track that assisted the seamers, UAE struck blows at regular intervals to clamp down on the scoring rate. 1

The umpires check for the front foot of the bowler, which was fine and Shakib has to walk back. How big is that wicket at this moment?

BANGLADESH:0.5 Naveed to Mithun, no run, well, Naveed dishes out a loud appeal for LBW. However, it was turned down. It jagged back off the seam considerably, Mithun came half forward and tried to keep it out. But it hit the pad first. On expected lines, Naveed belted out an appeal for LBW. Mithun might have been struck just outside the line of off-stump. Close shave though

BANGLADESH:0.3 Naveed to Mithun, 1 run, fuller length delivery and a hint of shape away from the right-hander, Mithun drives it to mid-off and scampers across. The fielder at mid-off fires in a direct-hit at the striker's end. But by then the batsman was in

BANGLADESH:0.1 Naveed to Mithun, no run, outside edge straightaway. However, it falls in front of the second slip fielder.

Encouragement straightaway for NaveedMithun and Soumya Sarkar are at the crease. Mithun is on strike. Naveed will open the attackThe UAE players are out in a huddle. It will be Mohammad Naveed who begins the proceedings. He has two slips in place. It is a jam-packed stadium out there, and they will be expecting the home team to put up a strong show. So, we are ready to go...Teams:United Arab Emirates (Playing XI): Rohan Mustafa, Muhammad Kaleem, Mohammad Shahzad, Muhammad Usman, Shaiman Anwar, Swapnil Patil(w), Fahad Tariq, Amjad Javed(c), Saqlain Haider, Ahmed Raza, Mohammad NaveedBangladesh (Playing XI): Nurul Hasan(wk) , Soumya Sarkar, Sabbir Rahman, Mohammad Mithun, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Al-Amin HossainMashrafe Mortaza: I would have batted first. Last match, we lost early wickets, we will like to have wickets in hand and post a good total. T20 game is like that, there are no big teams or small teams. Imrul Kayes is not playing, Sohan (Nurul Hasan) comes into the side.Amjad Javed: We will bowl first. I will expect my boys to give the same performance as yesterday. Definitely, there are some new guys who have never played in front of TV. It is a very good track for the pacers. We have got only one change.United Arab Emirates have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch report: There are chunks of grass. Nothing to worry about if you are a bowler. For batsmen, it is about occupying the crease and leaving the good deliveries. It will be important to not lose wickets during the beginning of the innings. Overall, conditions look spicy for the bowlers not so much for the batsmen, reckons Rameez Raja.On the other hand, Amjad Javed's men will take a lot of heart from their compelling performance against the world champions. It will be foolhardy if the Bangla Tigers drop their guard. They (UAE) were successful in stopping the Lankans from posting a huge total but it was their poor batting which managed just 115 runs. UAE are capable of causing a few jitters in the opposition as we saw in the World Cup last year. A new day and a different opponent must boost their confidence. If they play their cards right, bat sensibly and bowl a tight line and length, the hosts could experience something different. Toss and teams coming up in a short while....Bangladesh have lost three of their last four T20 matches and will be under a lot of pressure to deliver in front of the home crowd. The hosts did not look convincing against India but should find their footing against the Asian minnows. On a pitch that provided plenty of help to the bowlers, the Tigers allowed MS Dhoni's men to register a productive total of 166 in the competition's opening clash. Despite Sabbir Rahman's 32-ball 44, they never had a chance to come back in the game after losing wickets at regular intervals, managing 121 for seven from their 20 overs. Bangladesh are yet to substantiate themselves in the T20 design but one can expect a strong execution from a youthful, eager group.Hello and welcome to the 3rd encounter of the Asia Cup between Bangladesh and UAE. Both teams will look to change their fortunes after faltering in their respective opening fixtures. Of course, the relatively experienced hosts will start as favourites, but as evidenced by their plucky performance against Sri Lanka, UAE seem capable of springing a surprise. The bowling from both sides look good, with seamers and the spinners doing their job well. It is the batting which needs to be addressed as neither side showed any application in their opening match.Preview by Ganesh ChandrasekaranThe performance against Sri Lanka was a shot in the arm for UAE. Their bowling came up trumps against a quality batting unit like Sri Lanka and with a little more application from the batsmen, they could have well caused an upset. But Malinga's brilliance came in the way. What the game has done, however, is spice things up forUAE's second consecutive encounter - against Bangladesh on Friday (February 26).The hosts themselves will be eager to stage a winning comeback having lost their first game against India. A full house is expected and will be one of the factors to counter for an inexperienced team like UAE. Says Amjad Javed, the skipper "I think they have played two games on TV. Definitely, tomorrow there will be a crowd supporting Bangladesh but if you don't see outside, stick to your task and concentrate on the game, (it will be) good for UAE. I want my boys to do that only. Not seeing the crowd outside, but seeing the ball is most important for us."For UAE, the pressure of playing in front of big crowds and in front of a larger television audience is as much a factor to counter than playing just the opposition.Javed insists that his team is out there to win and not just compete. "If you are being negative with your team then there is really no use of coming and playing," he chuckles. "My statement was very simple- just go out there and win the game."In that aspect, the performance against Sri Lanka has only raised the confidence of the team to do even better. Their bowling department restricted Sri Lanka to just 129 but when the final nails had to be hammered in, the batsmen fell short. "If the batsmen see the bowlers restricting a team like Sri Lanka to under 130, they will want to do well. I think they will do well tomorrow," exudes a positive Javed.Bangladesh though will be a different kettle of fish. What was evident in the first two games of the Asia Cup is that the grass is greener on the side of the pacers.In both games, the spinners have been pushed to the backseat quite unlike traditional sub-continental conditions. The hosts boast of a pace quartet with plenty of talent, led by Mashrafe Mortaza. Each adds a different dimension to the attack. If its control for the skipper, then it is variations for Mustafizur, pace and bounce for Taskin, swing from a slinging action for Al-Amin Hossain. They will be under the spotlight once again against UAE. With their batsmen showing a weakness against quality pace bowling, Bangladesh will be hoping to inflict similar wounds.While the bowlers have found it easier, given the assistance from the pitch, naturally it is the reverse for batsmen. Mortaza will be wary of the batting department which has let him down consistently, particularly in T20Is. In the absence of Tamim Iqbal, there is additional pressure on the rest of the batsmen to step up. They will be pondering a lot upon the batting order as well. With the likes of Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim coming quite late in the middle order, Bangladesh find themselves in a quandary when the power-hitting needs to be done right from the outset. A little tinkering might well happen to accommodate the right men at the right positions.It is unlikely that UAE will change much anything with regards to their bowlers. A few changes in the batting unit might be warranted but even that is unlikely given how Javed backed them to go for their shots again. The skipper was vehement in defence of his batsmen and insisted that the only way the runs were going to come was by playing those shots.With both teams battling similar problems within their ranks, the contest ought to be a good one. Javed was confident of UAE pulling off a few upsets in the tournament.
