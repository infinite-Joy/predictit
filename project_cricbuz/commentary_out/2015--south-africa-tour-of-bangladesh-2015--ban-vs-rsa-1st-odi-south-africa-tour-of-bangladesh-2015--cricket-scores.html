Mustafizur Rahman will open the attackMustafizur Rahman will open the proceedings with one slip in placePlayers are walking out to the middle. So, can Bangladesh spring a surprise after putting up a modest performance with the bat? South Africa though, should chase this target down.Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahm tried to steady the innings, but once they were dismissed, the hosts lost their way. Nasir Hossain looked to shepherd the tail. However, in attempt to look for quick runs, he looked to scoop Chris Morris through fine leg and was castled. The visitors should fancy their chances of chasing down the target. Join us in a short while for the run-chase.Kagiso Rabada, on his ODI debut, picked up a hat-trick and ended up with a 6-for to help the visitors clean up Bangladesh for a modest total. After persistent rain delayed the start of play, the game was reduced to 40 overs per side. However, the young fast bowler, Rabada, in his second over ripped through the opposition ranks by snaring the wickets of Tamim Iqbal, Litton Das and Mahmuddlah off consecutive deliveries.Kagiso Rabada (8-3-16-6) leads the Proteas off the field. What a performance it has been from the youngster. He first became only the second bowler in ODI history to take a hat-trick on debut. In addition to that, he ended with 6/16, giving him the best bowling figures on debut. He overtook Fidel Edwards, who took 6/22 against Zimbabwe in 2003.3

Fingers crossed that we will get a full game.Mahmudullah, who couldn't feature in the series against India and wasn't part of the T20Is against South Africa as well, due to a finger injury, is expected to come back into the side. Bangladesh will be defintely bolstered by his return.The visitors, too, would be confident after winning the T20I series against the hosts. However, they would miss the services of their regular ODI captain, AB de Villiers, as he has been rested. Hashim Amla will take over the reins for this series. Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, JP Duminy and David Miller will be looking to make their mark. Kyle Abbott and Aaron Phangiso did well in the T20Is and they are expected to be picked. South Africa's attack will be bolstered by the return of the experienced duo of Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir.A warm welcome to our ball-by-ball coverage of the first ODI between South Africa and Bangladesh in Mirpur. The hosts, Bangladesh, will go into the the series riding high on their victories against Pakistan and India, respectively. Most of their players are in fine touch. If Soumya Sarkar, Shakib Al Hasan and Sabbir Rahman notched up creditable performances against India, then Tamim Iqbal compiled two tons and a fifty against Pakistan. Among the bowlers, Mustafizur Rahman, with his variations, snared 13 wickets in a mere three games against India.Preview:The times are changing. There are new rules, yet again, in the ODI format. The field restrictions are supposed to ease the pressure on the bowlers. AB de Villiers is missing from the South African line-up. There's no Dale Steyn as well. South Africa are looking to use the chance to blood in a few youngsters. Bangladesh have not taken this as a slight on their reputation. This new Bangladesh team seems quietly confident about their abilities, particularly in the ODI format.Pakistan were blanked and India were thrashed by the same team just a few weeks ago. That hasn't stopped South Africa from resting their top players. They managed to win the two T20Is preceding the ODIs, but Bangladesh will believe that they can cause another 'upset' in the series. A victory will give them a greater chance of qualifying for the Champions Trophy in 2017. That will be their driving force while South Africa look upon the series as another chance to boost their credentials.Date: 10th JulyVenue: Shere Bangla National Stadium, DhakaTime: 09:00 GMTBangladesh:Under Mashrafe Mortaza, Bangladesh have witnessed a stunning turnaround. The skipper has instilled pride in each member and looks keen to shake off the tag of pushovers. With Chandika Hathurasinghe for company, Mortaza has built a potent team filled with hungry and talented performers who have been playing without fear of reputations. Tamim Iqbal, Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan will form the core of the batting unit once again. The return of Mahmudullah will bolster the middle order while the presence of youngsters like Litton Das adds to the lustre.Probable XI: Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza, Mustafizur Rahman, Rubel Hossain, Arafat SunnySouth Africa:Hashim Amla will be leading the side in the absence of AB de Villiers and the skipper must do enough to ensure that there is no complacency in the ranks. Given the dry nature of the tracks, Amla might be tempted to pick both spinners - Imran Tahir and Aaron Phangiso. The presence of all-rounders like Ryan McLaren offers the skipper with a lot of depth and possibilities to tinker the combination. Despite the absence of de Villiers, the batting unit does have enough experience and firepower to tackle the conditions but they will have to be at their best. Bangladesh have shown that they can choke any opposition down with their spin attack and South Africa will have to ensure that they never get bogged down or let the crowd pressure get to them.Probable XI: Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, JP Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Farhaan Behardien, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Wayne Parnell, Aaron PhangisoStats and Trivia:- Bangladesh have not lost a home series since February- Since taking over full-time captaincy, Mortaza has lost only 4 out of 18 games as skipperQuotes:When it comes to ODIs, we are a lot more confident unit and we will only grow in confidence - Tamim Iqbal is very sure of the team's frame of mindTeams:South Africa (From): Faf du Plessis, Hashim Amla(c), Quinton de Kock(w), Rilee Rossouw, Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Chris Morris, Kyle Abbott, Aaron Phangiso, Kagiso Rabada, Wayne Parnell, Eddie Leie, Imran Tahir, Farhaan Behardien, Morne Morkel, Ryan McLarenBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Shakib Al Hasan, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Nasir Hossain, Sabbir Rahman, Litton Das, Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Jubair Hossain, Anamul HaqueLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
