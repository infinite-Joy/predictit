Sarfraz emulates his previous shot - a shimmy down the track and a lofted drive. Couldn't have picked the fielder any better, straight in front of the reverse-cupping David Willey at mid-on. That should be the game for England. Sarfraz c Willey b Adil Rashid 24(26) [4s-2]Adil Rashid to Sarfraz, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

It was a tremendous take from Alex Hales. That drop catch earlier must have fired him up. Topley offers a lollypop (full toss) and Malik slogs sans any timing. Neither got the power nor the elevation behind the shot. Hales from mid-wicket sprints across, puts in the dive and grabs a stunner (just inches above the turf). England got the key man and now the target shifts to Sarfraz - the last recognized batsman left in the middle. Shoaib Malik c Hales b Topley 52(34) [4s-3 6s-2]Topley to Shoaib Malik, THAT'S OUT!!

PAKISTAN:13.5 Topley to Babar Azam, FOUR, who's Federer? Short and slower outside off, Azam plays the double-handed forehand to smack the ball to the long-off fence. All power there. Tennis lessons must have helped
PAKISTAN:13.5 Topley to Babar Azam, wide, down the leg side this time. Topley's under pressure. Umpire has his arms stretched wide in disapproval
PAKISTAN:13.4 Topley to Hafeez, 1 run, guided away needly to third man for a single
PAKISTAN:13.4 Topley to Hafeez, wide, tries to bowl it wide of off and Hafeez needed a golf club to play that
PAKISTAN:13.3 Topley to Hafeez, SIX, oh my! Dubai is witnessing a classic. Slower ball from Topley, Hafeez had his big glasses on to read that, swings his arms and launches it into the deep mid-wicket orbit
PAKISTAN:13.2 Topley to Hafeez, no run, worked into the off-side this one but no holes in the field for Hafeez here
PAKISTAN:13.1 Topley to Babar Azam, 1 run, hard hands. Full in length, Azam tries to smack the hell out of this one, can only mistime it back to the bowler. Slight hesitation from Hafeez to respond to the call but all was well in the endReece Topley [2.0-0-18-0] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:12.6 Moeen Ali to Babar Azam, 1 run, drifting in on the pads, Azam shuffles and clips it to backward square leg
PAKISTAN:12.5 Moeen Ali to Hafeez, 1 run, flat and full, Hafeez turned it round the corner and charged off. A throw from mid-wicket post running to his right is not good enough

PAKISTAN:11.4 Woakes to Hafeez, 1 run, glided away to third man with an open bat face, runs a single to get to the other end
PAKISTAN:11.3 Woakes to Hafeez, no run, a push into the off-side in defence on this occasion
PAKISTAN:11.2 Woakes to Hafeez, FOUR, that's neater than a last bencher's mathematics paper. Length delivery, Hafeez gets under it and plays the smoothy loft, the ball times itself straight down the ground for a one-bounce four
PAKISTAN:11.1 Woakes to Babar Azam, 1 run, back of a length delivery that refuses to rise up, Azam had to close the bat face to keep it down and turns it to mid-on
PAKISTAN:10.6 Willey to Hafeez, 2 runs, oh my, Willey is playing the Dubai Santa here. Another short delivery down the leg side, another swivelled pull but fine leg was finer this time and cuts it off

PAKISTAN:10.3 Willey to Hafeez, no run, is the Pakistani dressing room watching? You can duck under a short ball too. Hafeez just showed it to them

PAKISTAN:10.1 Willey to Hafeez, no run, good-looking push to mid-on, cannot buy a run off this full delivery on of
PAKISTAN:9.6 Woakes to Hafeez, 1 run, brilliant from Topley at mid-on. Leaps in the air to his right and just cuts it off. Very good indeed. This was whipped by Hafeez from outside off, not much timing on that but it shouldn't take anything away from that airy dive

PAKISTAN:9.2 Woakes to Hafeez, 1 run, not too great a pace on this length delivery outside off, Hafeez dabs it with open face and whistles off. Throw was fired in by backward point but Babar Azam was well in
PAKISTAN:9.1 Woakes to Hafeez, no run, just an assured defence to mid-on on this occasion. A pinch of sanity amidst all the mayhem
PAKISTAN:8.6 Willey to Babar Azam, FOUR, you have to palm the catches on a day the Dubai pitch is offering you to them. Not having a second slip doesn't help. It was banged in on short of length, Azam plays the chained-feet punch, the ball takes the thick outside edge and flies wide of the first slip to third man. It's all happening at the moment
PAKISTAN:8.5 Willey to Babar Azam, no run, nearly in the blockhole, Willey still getting some purchase in the air, Azam flicks it straight to mid-wicketBabar Azam, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:8.4 Willey to Azhar Ali, out Caught&Bowled!! And he's gone? Can you believe it? Such a soft, soft dismissal. Willey rolled his fingers across the ball, Ali was looking to defend it with a closed bat face, ends up chipping it back to the bowler, who takes a good low catch. Somewhat off the leading edge and Willey lets out a roar into the batsman's face. Azhar Ali c and b Willey 44(32) [4s-6 6s-2]Willey to Azhar Ali, THAT'S OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!
PAKISTAN:8.3 Willey to Azhar Ali, FOUR, half-deliberate and Ali will not mind the runs he got off them. Short of a length outside off, Ali threw his hands at it as he tried to smear an uppish cut, the ball takes the top-edge and speeds away over the vacant cordon on its way to the third man fence
PAKISTAN:8.2 Willey to Azhar Ali, no run, arrow straight push from Ali that brushes Willey's hand on his crouched followthrough but refuses to take the stumps at the other end

PAKISTAN:7.4 Woakes to Azhar Ali, no run, rigth line, slower delivery on the middle and off, Ali waits on it and turns it towards the man at mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:7.3 Woakes to Azhar Ali, FOUR, Woakes is losing it already. Trashy delivery down the leg, not an ideal follow-up to a deflating pull shot, Ali half-turns and glances it very fine, off the ball goes
PAKISTAN:7.2 Woakes to Azhar Ali, SIX, the ball might just have bled there. Woakes continues testing the batsmen with bouncers, tempts them again into underestimating the pace but Ali was upto it. Rocks back and times the pants out of it with a slash-the-air pull shot
PAKISTAN:7.1 Woakes to Azhar Ali, no run, short of length delivery makes Ali hop on his toes and tucks the ball into the on-side

PAKISTAN:6.3 Willey to Ahmed Shehzad, out Caught by Moeen Ali!! And Shehzad falls into the same fish-net that he was trying to make holes in. Short ball, held up in the pitch perhaps, Shehzad was early into his pull and mistimed it straight down the throat of the man at deep square leg. England get a foot in the door. Ahmed Shehzad c Moeen Ali b Willey 13(17) [4s-1]Willey to Ahmed Shehzad, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Morgan has a word with Willey
PAKISTAN:6.2 Willey to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, length nut hurled in around the sixth stump line, Shehzad backs away to manufacture room but chops the cut to cover-point

PAKISTAN:5.3 Woakes to Azhar Ali, SIX, geez, not this time. Woakes' pace has got what it deserved. Another short ball, Ali was waiting, smacks the pull, no roll of the wrists and the deep mid-wicket fence suffers
PAKISTAN:5.2 Woakes to Azhar Ali, no run, run out appeal but Ali was well in. Third umpire confirms the same. And no suicide against the short ball please. Woakes tries the old trick of bowling it short, Ali again fell to the bait and pulled, the top-edge falls in the vacant FSL. Buttler ran in to effect a run out as Ali tried to steal a run there
PAKISTAN:5.1 Woakes to Azhar Ali, no run, fullish in length, Ali plays the forceful laden-footed punch to mid-onChris Woakes, right-arm medium, comes into the attackRags-to-riches Woakes on to bowl now

PAKISTAN:4.2 Willey to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, nearly. That was hit very hard. Shortish outside off, Shehzad throws the kitchen sink on the cut, the ball rockets to Taylor at short cover who can't hold on - such was the speed. He got both hands but the ball burst through

PAKISTAN:3.4 Topley to Ahmed Shehzad, no run, smidgen full on the pads, Shehzad decides against the whippy shot and pushes it back to the bowler

PAKISTAN:1.5 Topley to Azhar Ali, no run, mighty swing of the bat but to no avail. Does he have an option? No. The ball whizzes past the bat and the keeper has his hands on his head
PAKISTAN:1.4 Topley to Azhar Ali, 2 runs, on-the-pads fest at the moment, inswing largely contributing to it, Ali helps it off his pads for a brace to deep square leg

PAKISTAN:1.3 Topley to Azhar Ali, wide, hurls this one down the leg-side, unable to control the swing on that occasion, wide called

Azhar Ali is on strike. Willey will open the attackSo, all set then. You might have heard making-mountain-of-a-molehill often but Pakistan have to do it the other way down to level the series, which given Pakistan's history looks a long shot away at the moment. Buttler and Co. spring towards the middle. Willey is on his mark and rolling his wrists. Shehzad makes his series-debut. Here we go.In case you've just joined us, one witnessed Buttler unleash what was a memorable and rollicking knock on a typical Dubai wicket. Here are a few set of records he has managed to break while achieving his 3rd ODI ton* Jos Buttler, now has the quickest ODI ton for England. His century was also the fastest against Pakistan in ODIs* The first three fastest tons by an Englishman are now all in the names of Joseph Charles Buttler* He also equalled Jesse Ryder's record for the sixth quickest century in ODIs* Buttler's blazing knock helped England post their highest total overseas. It is also their 6th highest total in ODIsIt felt like there were two games going on. The first 30-35 overs, and then the Buttler onslaught. Jason Roy and Joe Root stabilized the innings and set a platform. In fact, before it slips my mind - Roy registered his maiden ODI ton. Pakistan struck back removing both the set men. But little did they know what was to follow. Now have a job on their hands to level the series. We'll be back for the chase in around 30 minutes.I'm out of breath. Wait a minute. Meanwhile, the crowd stands to applaud what has been a once-in-a-season innings. Is he the same bloke who was struggling for every run a month back. Wow. Just wow. What more can I say? Came out and started swinging. And it kept going further, and further, and further. 355/5, oh my. Pakistan, fancy that! They'll have to produce something seriously special.4
ENGLAND:49.6 Riaz to Buttler, 2 runs, not quite the picture-perfect finish. Speared in wide, Buttler only manages to get it off the bottom of the bat over extra-cover. Before the sweeper tidies up he's back for two
ENGLAND:49.5 Riaz to Buttler, 2 runs, full and wide, Buttler bends low and squeezes it through the cover region. Run, run, run. They do and Buttler's back for two
ENGLAND:49.4 Riaz to Buttler, FOUR, everything's going to the fences. Pakistan are going to the cleaners. And the crowd is going berserk. Slower ball clobbered across the line wide of long-on
ENGLAND:49.3 Riaz to Buttler, FOUR, off-cutter on the pads, now some elegance from this marauder. Glances it fine, to beat square leg in the ring. Slick!
ENGLAND:49.3 Riaz to Buttler, no ball, oh dear, as if he needs a free-hit at this stage. Attempted yorker gone wrong. Well over waist height outside off, Buttler tries to reach out but misses
ENGLAND:49.2 Riaz to Buttler, no run, slower delivery outside off, Buttler swings and misses
ENGLAND:49.2 Riaz to Buttler, 5 wides, this sums up the slog overs for Pakistan. They have lost the plot. Slips out of the hand and down the leg-side. No way the keeper is stopping that
ENGLAND:49.1 Riaz to Moeen Ali, 1 run, slingy fuller length delivery, driven down to mid-off
ENGLAND:48.6 Anwar Ali to Buttler, SIX, wherever you are, stop for a minute. Stand up and applaud. I'm doing the same. Just 46 deliveries for a ton. Sixth fastest in ODIs. He jumps and roars in delight. His teammates are doing the same. They are beyond themselves and overcome with joy. Length ball angled into him, smashed over mid-wicket. Played Sir Jos!
ENGLAND:48.5 Anwar Ali to Buttler, SIX, oh, look at that. 98 now. I am out of words. Joe Root is jumping around like a maniac on the balcony. Fuller length ball just outside off, looks at that bottom hand. Uses the long-handle and spanks it over long-off
ENGLAND:48.4 Anwar Ali to Buttler, 2 runs, low full toss on the stumps, Buttler drags it off the inside half of the bat through mid-wicket
ENGLAND:48.3 Anwar Ali to Buttler, SIX, he's bludgeoned his way into the 90s. Slower good length delivery following Buttler as he's backing away. He absolutely murders this over mid-wicket. Meets it with a full-blooded swipe
ENGLAND:48.2 Anwar Ali to Buttler, no run, sees Buttler shaping for the scoop, bowls a slower one on a good length on off, Buttler was through with the shot, it hits the back of his bat and rolls away to the keeper's right leaving him wrong-footed. Did well to collect
ENGLAND:48.1 Anwar Ali to Moeen Ali, 1 run, advancing before the bowler is into his delivery stride, Anwar bangs it in short. Was the slower bouncer I suspect. Moeen waits and pulls it along the carpet through mid-wicketAnwar Ali [8.0-0-54-0] is back into the attack
ENGLAND:47.6 Riaz to Moeen Ali, 1 run, yeah, that's where the cheddar is. Right in the blockhole again. Squeezed down towards mid-off
ENGLAND:47.5 Riaz to Buttler, 1 run, very full on off, just missed the blockhole by a couple of inches. Buttler opens his stance and spears it straight. So straight that it clatters the set of stumps at the other end
ENGLAND:47.4 Riaz to Buttler, 2 runs, what did I tell you? There are only gaps for him. Skies his pull off a thick top edge. And it teases a backtracking square leg and a hurtling deep mid-wicket to bisect them to perfection
ENGLAND:47.3 Riaz to Buttler, FOUR, there are only gaps on the field for Buttler, no fielders. Slingy full toss outside off, he deliberately slices his push and hits the gap between short third man and backward point
ENGLAND:47.2 Riaz to Moeen Ali, 1 run, yanks his pace right back on this back of a length delivery, Moeen is way too early with the pull, has to hold it back and check his shot towards square leg
ENGLAND:47.1 Riaz to Moeen Ali, no run, speared full and wide, wide enough for Moeen to miss with his driveWahab Riaz [7.0-0-42-0] is back into the attackMoeen Ali, left handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:46.6 Irfan to James Taylor, out Caught by Ahmed Shehzad at !! No, this doesn't quite seem to be his game. Slogging I mean. And also, he was hoodwinked by the lack of pace. Off-pace length delivery around off, Taylor is way too early in the slog. Spoons it off the bottom towards long-on. They don't come much easier. James Taylor c Ahmed Shehzad b Irfan 13(14) [6s-1]Irfan to James Taylor, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
ENGLAND:46.5 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, clever bowling. Taylor is a short man with short arms. Had to reach out to connect with this one fired wide. Can't quite do so
ENGLAND:46.4 Irfan to James Taylor, 2 runs, oh, Taylor is still batting. Quietly watching the massacre from the other end. Now it's his turn to swing. Fraction full outside off, he looks to go inside-out but plays inside the line slightly. Ends up slicing it off a thick outside edge over backward point. Right between two fielders
ENGLAND:46.3 Irfan to Buttler, 1 run, that's the only way you are going to tie him down. Speared into the blockhole. Dug out in front of mid-wicket
ENGLAND:46.2 Irfan to Buttler, FOUR, Bumble has one word to describe this shot "Outrageous". I can't find anything more apt. Moves well outside off, nearly touching the wide tramlines. Gets it on a length and scoops it over a helpless keeper
ENGLAND:46.1 Irfan to James Taylor, 1 run, Taylor gives the charge, makes it into an overpitched delivery and laces it through the coversMohammad Irfan [9.0-0-56-1] is back into the attack
ENGLAND:45.6 Anwar Ali to Buttler, SIX, now a high full toss. Smited over square leg. It's going down the fielder's throat. Is it? Is it? No. Oh boy. He was atleast 3-4 yards inside the rope. And that has ended up costing heavily. Evades his leap and just about clears the fence
ENGLAND:45.5 Anwar Ali to Buttler, SIX, Buttler, Buttler, Buttler! He's on the rampage. Just slightly short, caned away over square leg. This is some hitting. Ferocious. Just transfers his weight back and thumps it hard
ENGLAND:45.4 Anwar Ali to Buttler, FOUR, this is quite an extraordinary shot. Length ball angling in on leg, Buttler's feet don't move at all. It's like playing French cricket. He just reverses his hands and scoops it over short third man. Brilliant
ENGLAND:45.3 Anwar Ali to Buttler, 2 runs, the good 'ol yorker, can't do much with that can you? Buttler still manages a couple by squeezing it in front of long-on
ENGLAND:45.2 Anwar Ali to Buttler, FOUR, slower bouncer, climbs nicely towards head-height, this time Buttler knew what was coming. Waits on the pull and then clanks it away behind square
ENGLAND:45.1 Anwar Ali to Buttler, no run, that's the way to go. Just don't give any pace. Slowed it right down on a length outside off, the ball refused to get up from the pitch and scooted under the bottom edge of Buttler's heave through to the keeperAnwar Ali [7.0-0-32-0] is back into the attack
ENGLAND:44.6 Riaz to Buttler, 1 run, bangs it in short, was another cutter, Buttler saw it late and dragged the pull down to fine leg off the bottom of the bat. Brings up fifty in just 30 balls
ENGLAND:44.5 Riaz to Buttler, 2 runs, another off-pace delivery, ends up being a low full toss following the batsman who was backing away, Buttler tries to flick it away but is deceived by the lack of pace. Ends up popping a leading edge towards long-on
ENGLAND:44.4 Riaz to Buttler, no run, Buttler moves leg-side, and he's left looking a touch embarrased. Slower fuller ball from Riaz outside off, Buttler didn't even try to a shot
ENGLAND:44.3 Riaz to Buttler, SIX, wallop! Buttler's in the mood. Slightly short on the stumps, Buttler transfers his weight on the back foot after the initial stride forward and smacks the pull over mid-wicket. Buckle up fellas
ENGLAND:44.2 Riaz to Buttler, FOUR, length ball outside off, and bang! He doesn't bother to move across with his front foot. Just throws his arms after it and laces it over extra-cover
ENGLAND:44.1 Riaz to James Taylor, 1 run, back of a length delivery angled away, Taylor drops it in front of backward point and hustles awayWahab Riaz [6.0-0-28-0] is back into the attack
ENGLAND:43.6 Irfan to Buttler, FOUR, overpitched outside off, Buttler extends his arms and squeezes the drive behind square. Yasir Shah runs around from sweeper cover, puts in the dive but in vain
ENGLAND:43.5 Irfan to Buttler, 2 runs, full toss on off, Buttler is rapped on the pad after missing his flick. Don't think he was expecting the full bunger at this stage. The ball rolls away to backward point who fires in a direct hit at the striker's end. Ends up costing an extra run. Actually, it was a good shout for LBW. Very close
ENGLAND:43.4 Irfan to Buttler, FOUR, what was that? First he walked across looking to scoop, saw that the line is a bit wide, then adjusts to open the face and ramp it over the pseudo slip cordon. Third man runs in for the catch. But the ball was always dipping on him. In the end, he neither catches the ball nor prevents the boundary. Got it? Good.
ENGLAND:43.3 Irfan to Buttler, FOUR, blimey. Watch out Pakistan. Watch out. Nothing wrong with the delivery. Perfectly on a good length and deliberately bowled wider of off, Buttler moves across and just spanks it over mid-wicket. Made a musical sound off the willow
ENGLAND:43.2 Irfan to James Taylor, 1 run, back of a length delivery on middle, Taylor tucks it wide of mid-wicket
ENGLAND:43.1 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, length ball gunning for the top of off, Taylor's upper body leans into an attempted cover-drive but his front foot doesn't listen. Nearly overbalances and gets an inside edge to mid-wicket
ENGLAND:42.6 Azhar Ali to James Taylor, 1 run, slightly fuller, Taylor can get close to the pitch and nudge it down to long-on
ENGLAND:42.5 Azhar Ali to James Taylor, no run, now back to over the wicket for Taylor. Quicker through the air on the stumps, pushed back to the bowler
ENGLAND:42.4 Azhar Ali to Buttler, leg byes, 1 run, changes the angle of attack to round the wicket. Fired in on the pads, Buttler aims a sweep but the delivery is too full. Beats him on the inside edge and rolls away in front of short third man off the pad
ENGLAND:42.3 Azhar Ali to Buttler, SIX, he might be having some technical deficiencies but you can't question his ball-striking prowess. Hurtles down the pitch, leaves enough room to allow a clean swing, and muscles it straight back
ENGLAND:42.2 Azhar Ali to Buttler, no run, pulls the length back as Buttler was advancing, he can only smother it to cover
ENGLAND:42.1 Azhar Ali to Buttler, 2 runs, the attempted leg-break which skids on straight after landing on a length on off, Buttler was playing for some more turn and looking to push it into the off-side, gets a thick inside edge and the ball dribbles away through square leg. They push for two and Buttler has to put in a full stretched dive to make it

ENGLAND:41.5 Irfan to James Taylor, SIX, hohoho! He's picked the bones out of that. Short of length, doesn't climb more than the midriff, Taylor pivots on the back foot and creams the pull behind square. Used all the pace on offer and didn't bother to keep it down
ENGLAND:41.4 Irfan to James Taylor, no run, nothing pitched up from Irfan. Everything behind a good length. Taylor moves his back foot across and guides it to backward point

ENGLAND:40.2 Azhar Ali to Eoin Morgan, out Stumped!! Pakistan are forcing themselves back into the picture. Now the captain is on his way back. Flashed his cards too early. Azhar saw him advancing, pulled his length back and slipped in the googly. Morgan, quite unaware, tries to bludgeon it across the line. The ball rips away beating the outside edge. Easy stumping to effect. Eoin Morgan st Sarfraz b Azhar Ali 14(13) [4s-2]Azhar Ali to Eoin Morgan, THAT'S OUT!! Stumped!!

ENGLAND:39.3 Shoaib Malik to Buttler, 1 run, darted in on the pads, Buttler can't do anything more than tucking it through mid-wicket
ENGLAND:39.2 Shoaib Malik to Buttler, SIX, oh boy, looked like he had sliced it off a top edge. But it kept going and going. He does pack a punch. Bends on the back knee and unfurls the slog-sweep. Nowhere near the sweet spot but the scorebook says six. That's all that matters
ENGLAND:39.1 Shoaib Malik to Eoin Morgan, 1 run, the arm ball, skids on after pitching on off, Morgan was shaping to cut. Gets cramped for room and hits it limply in front of coverShoaib Malik [6.0-0-43-0] is back into the attack

ENGLAND:36.6 Azhar Ali to Eoin Morgan, leg byes, 1 run, Morgan aims to works this one around the corner and misses. Pakistan's fielders appeal for an LBW, but it was going down leg. In the end, they decide against taking a review and it was missing the leg-stump by a mile. The duo take a leg-bye
ENGLAND:36.5 Azhar Ali to Eoin Morgan, no run, stump-to-stump line, defendedEoin Morgan, left handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:36.4 Azhar Ali to Root, out Stumped!! Azhar has taken his maiden ODI wicket and it turns out to be a crucial one too as Root is the batsman who is dismissed. Root aimed for the reverse sweep, but failed to connect. He lost his balance as he looked to get back to the crease. Sarfraz whipped the bails off in a flash and Root found himself well short of the crease. Pakistan are chipping away at the wickets now.

ENGLAND:13.5 Irfan to Root, 1 run, short on the body, climbs around the chest, Root swivels across and pulls it behind square.

ENGLAND:13.1 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, Roy plays his 420th cut shot. But as with the previous ones, straight to backward point
ENGLAND:12.6 Riaz to Root, no run, no, you won't trouble him there. So composed on the back foot. Gets right behind the line and blocks
ENGLAND:12.5 Riaz to Jason Roy, 1 run, a bit too straight on a back of a length, Roy works it wide of mid-on and hurries through with the single
ENGLAND:12.4 Riaz to Jason Roy, FOUR, ah, lovely! That should settle him down. Overpitched, yes. But still has to be put away. Roy moves forward and drives it gun-barrel straight
ENGLAND:12.3 Riaz to Jason Roy, no run, he is on the lookout for it, isn't he? Anything slightly wide and he tries to cut. This was too close to be playing the shot. Chops it back down to Riaz
ENGLAND:12.2 Riaz to Jason Roy, no run, as soon as the ball is close to him, much more comfortable. An impregnable front foot block
ENGLAND:12.1 Riaz to Jason Roy, no run, Roy is currently batting on a wheelchair. All hands. Aims an on-the-up cover drive, ends up dragging it off a thickish bottom edge to mid-off
ENGLAND:11.6 Irfan to Root, no run, oh a beaut! Angled in on a length, straightens off the pitch. Root is completely hoodwinked by the movement on his defensive push. Beaten by a mile
ENGLAND:11.5 Irfan to Root, no run, Root on the back foot = comfort. Stands tall to ride this short of length delivery and punches to backward point
ENGLAND:11.4 Irfan to Jason Roy, 1 run, now gets it wider of the man to sneak in a run. Escorts the ball to third man with an open bat face
ENGLAND:11.3 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, waits till the ball is in line with his eyes and guides it towards gully
ENGLAND:11.2 Irfan to Jason Roy, 2 runs, skiddy back of a length delivery outside off, Roy back-cuts it in the air, just evades gully to third manJoe Root, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:11.1 Irfan to Hales, out Caught by Shoaib Malik!! Catch it Malik, catch it. And he does. Before tumbling over like a tired old man. Short of length delivery outside off, Hales rocks back and commits to the pull. Again holds up on him. Might have been a trifle early into the shot. Gets it off a thick top edge. The ball floats over to the left of third man. Easy enough for the veteran. On replays, I can infer that it was one of those cutters which stuck in the deck. Hales c Shoaib Malik b Irfan 22(29) [4s-2]Irfan to Hales, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
ENGLAND:10.6 Riaz to Hales, 1 run, and there's the third man fielder in action again. Back of a length outside off, guided down to him. This has become in-vogue

ENGLAND:10.3 Riaz to Hales, 1 run, overpitching outside off, squeezes the drive to deep cover despite his weight never really moving into the shot
ENGLAND:10.2 Riaz to Hales, no run, looking to glide it down to the bombarded third man region again, gully throws himself to his left to put an end to that
ENGLAND:10.1 Riaz to Hales, no run, again moves a long way across on the back foot. Sees the delivery is on a length. Pays respect with an awkward looking defence. Should have been forward to tha
ENGLAND:9.6 Irfan to Hales, 1 run, now an easy dab straight to third man. This pitch as as dead as a graveyard. Just no pace
ENGLAND:9.5 Irfan to Hales, 2 runs, back of a length delivery outside off, Hales pokes it behind backward point. Third man runs around and keeps the batsmen to two
ENGLAND:9.4 Irfan to Jason Roy, 3 runs, another off-cutter. Full and slanting very wide outside off, Roy tries to lash it over the off-side. Ends up slicing it off a thick outside edge. Enough to clear cover-point. He gives a manly chase and hauls it back in
ENGLAND:9.3 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, very full, Roy jams the drive into the off-side
ENGLAND:9.2 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, off-pace back of a length delivery just outside off, Roy stands tall and blocks it to cover
ENGLAND:9.1 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, the pace is missing from Irfan. Fuller length on leg, Roy was looking to work it through the on-side. His bat comes down at an angle and is through with the shot even before the ball arrives. Beats the outside edge to thud on the pad. Pitched outside leg and hence can't be givenMohammad Irfan [3.0-0-15-0] is back into the attack
ENGLAND:8.6 Riaz to Hales, no run, his trigger movement is back and across. Quite exaggerated I must say. Back of a length wide of off, plays a punchy back foot drive with an open bat face. Can't get it past backward point
ENGLAND:8.5 Riaz to Jason Roy, 1 run, on the hips, clipped through square leg
ENGLAND:8.4 Riaz to Hales, 1 run, slightly short, Hales misjudged the pace looking to cut. Bat came down late and only manages to get it off the toe-end. Scooted to the right of slip who parries it to third man with a dive
ENGLAND:8.3 Riaz to Hales, no run, hitting the bat hard. Hales shuffles across on the back foot and guides it between first slip and backward point. Thought about a single but pulled out
ENGLAND:8.2 Riaz to Jason Roy, 1 run, kisses the surface on a back of a length outside off, Roy rolls his wrists on the steer down to third man
ENGLAND:8.1 Riaz to Jason Roy, no run, dishes it up just outside off, Roy is lured into the drive and hits it to cover-point
ENGLAND:7.6 Anwar Ali to Hales, no run, half-volley on the pads, Hales must be chastising himself. Flicks it straight to mid-wicket. Did a nice flamingo hauling his back foot in the air
ENGLAND:7.5 Anwar Ali to Hales, FOUR, benefit match bowling going on. Help yourself. Low full toss on the pads. Hales tickles it wide of short fine leg. And might have scoffed at the bowler while running past him
ENGLAND:7.4 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, 1 run, back of a length delivery on the fourth stump, Roy uses his bottom hand to good effect to whip it wide of mid-on
ENGLAND:7.3 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, no run, rolls his fingers across, 117ks, the off-cutter was delivered on a fuller length just outside off, Roy leans forward and his bat comes down caressingly on the straight drive. Too straight though. Anwar sticks out a hand to make a half-stop

ENGLAND:7.1 Anwar Ali to Hales, no run, punched defensively back to the bowler
ENGLAND:6.6 Riaz to Jason Roy, no run, slings it slightly short outside off, Roy aims a slap through point. Only connects with thin air. Where are your feet?
ENGLAND:6.5 Riaz to Jason Roy, no run, smidgen full than a good length, this time the bat comes down straight to meet it with a forward block
ENGLAND:6.4 Riaz to Jason Roy, FOUR, Roy is not playing the odds here. Front foot is hardly moving across. Length ball in the channel, attempts a cross-batted cover-drive on the up. Inside edge misses off-stump by a kitten's whisker
ENGLAND:6.3 Riaz to Hales, 1 run, we'll see this with Riaz. Everything behind a good length and slanting away. Knocked down to third man
ENGLAND:6.2 Riaz to Hales, no run, angling across, again testing the pitch on a back of a length, Hales chops it to cover-point
ENGLAND:6.1 Riaz to Jason Roy, 1 run, slingy back of a length delivery outside off, Roy waits and dabs it fine to third manWahab Riaz, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
ENGLAND:5.6 Anwar Ali to Hales, FOUR, fine leg up and he's dished one up on the pads. Hales can't believe his luck. Whips it away wide of the man in the ring
ENGLAND:5.5 Anwar Ali to Hales, no run, slightly short, not all that much. Hales waits on the back foot and cuts it precisely to backward point
ENGLAND:5.4 Anwar Ali to Hales, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, punched to cover
ENGLAND:5.3 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, 1 run, walks down the pitch looking to heave this length ball hard. Again holds up on him. Meaning that he was too early into the stroke. Only gets it off the toe-end. The ball cries away to Rizwan at mid-wicket. Who is in a world of his own. Can't catch a cold today. Misfields and allows a run
ENGLAND:5.2 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, no run, Ahmed Shehzad is back at backward point. Flies to his right to make a sizzling save. Length ball outside off, Roy slapped it after inclining towards the ball. Had timed the pants off it. But Shehzad is there
ENGLAND:5.1 Anwar Ali to Hales, 1 run, on a back of a length outside off, pecked it down to third man
ENGLAND:4.6 Irfan to Jason Roy, 2 runs, another off-cutter. Delivered on a good length around middle and off, Roy lazes forward and just pushes it straight of mid-on. Not much power behind the stroke
ENGLAND:4.5 Irfan to Jason Roy, 2 runs, short ball. Just sits up. Might have been the slower one as well. Roy had to drag his pull from outside off. Gets it right off the bottom but in the gap through mid-wicket
ENGLAND:4.4 Irfan to Hales, 1 run, back to round the wicket. Angled away outside off on a back of a length, poked down to third man
ENGLAND:4.3 Irfan to Hales, 2 runs, fluctuating too much in line currently. Now on leg stump, clipped away neatly behind square. Fine leg has work to do. Labours across to make the stop. The batsmen do the same. Easy couple
ENGLAND:4.2 Irfan to Jason Roy, 1 run, leaving the right-hander, just behind a good length, Roy waits till the ball is past him, then taps it on its head towards third man
ENGLAND:4.1 Irfan to Hales, leg byes, 1 run, gentle back of a length delivery on the hips, 132ks, Hales is slow to get his bat across for the tuck, misses and the ball rolls away behind square off the thigh padIrfan is juggling with his angle of attack. Now back to over the wicket

ENGLAND:3.4 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, no run, length ball two-three stumps away from off, Roy steers it to point
ENGLAND:3.3 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, no run, fraction full and wide of off, again Roy looks to drive through the off-side with minimalistic feet. Bat turns in the hand, and ends up rolling to mid-wicket
ENGLAND:3.2 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, no run, much more assured. Bigger stride forward to get beside the line, and offers a vertical bat
ENGLAND:3.1 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, FOUR, that's such a loose shot. Thank your stars Roy. Dangled full and wide of off, his feet are chained while aiming a half-hearted cover drive. The ball catches the inside edge and whisks away past leg-stump
ENGLAND:2.6 Irfan to Hales, no run, "howzaat", not good enough says the umpire. Big angle created from the round the wicket line. Full on the pads, Hales falls over on the flick meaning that he doesn't connect. Struck low down on the pad, but going down leg
ENGLAND:2.5 Irfan to Hales, no run, thought about having a poke. But nah. Climbs worryingly from a short of length outside off. Hales sways away from the line
ENGLAND:2.4 Irfan to Jason Roy, 1 run, length ball angled in on off and middle, Roy nudges it in the pocket between mid-on and mid-wicket
ENGLAND:2.3 Irfan to Hales, 1 run, short of length delivery in the channel, Hales punches it behind backward point with an open face. Third man moves across to keep it down to a single
ENGLAND:2.2 Irfan to Jason Roy, 1 run, Irfan's height just doesn't allow for a big forward stride. Length ball angling in on off from round the wicket, Roy gets half-forward to defend, catches the inside half of the bat and rolls down to fine leg
ENGLAND:2.1 Irfan to Jason Roy, 2 runs, stands on his toes to ride the short of length delivery, was aimed under the armpit, tucks it away behind square in the gap

ENGLAND:1.5 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, no run, fraction full on off, Roy strides forward and defends to mid-on
ENGLAND:1.4 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, no run, just behind a good length around the fifth-sixth stump, Roy's upper body was inclined forward and he slaps it hard. Can't get it past cover-point
ENGLAND:1.4 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, wide, floated up looking for swing. There isn't any and just drifts down with the angle down the leg side
ENGLAND:1.3 Anwar Ali to Hales, 1 run, a direct-hit and Hales was gone. A misfield earlier in the over meant that Rizwan was the fielder who could be taken on. Not to be this time. Moves swiftly to his right from mid-wicket after Hales had clipped it gently, slides to collect and rifles in the throw at the non-striker's end. Misses by a few inches
ENGLAND:1.2 Anwar Ali to Hales, no run, back of a length delivery with an inkling of nip back in on off, Hales didn't commit to any shot on the back foot allowing him to play the second line well. Blocks
ENGLAND:1.1 Anwar Ali to Jason Roy, 1 run, pitched right up on middle and leg, Roy flicks it straight to the man at mid-wicket. Rizwan is the fielder there. Fluffs it for no reason and parries it to mid-on off the boot. Didn't even get a hand. Allows a single to be sneaked inJust one slip for AnwarAnwar Ali, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
ENGLAND:0.6 Irfan to Hales, no run, buffet ball, full toss on the pads. But the batsmen are in the 'get-your-eye-in' mode. Which means that Hales meekly clips it to mid-wicket
ENGLAND:0.5 Irfan to Jason Roy, 1 run, back of a length delivery pushed across in the outside off channel, dabbed down to third man
ENGLAND:0.4 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, shortish just outside off, the width isn't quite there but Roy still opts to cut. Ends up being cramped for room and chops it to cover-point
ENGLAND:0.3 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, now on the pads, whipped stylishly but straight to square leg
ENGLAND:0.2 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, slanted away from the right-hander, slightly short. Roy maintains a solid base with his feet and cuts it to the left of cover-point. The fielder moves across and stops
ENGLAND:0.1 Irfan to Jason Roy, no run, gets it right, on a length on off, Roy moves forward and blocks to mid-on
ENGLAND:0.1 Irfan to Jason Roy, wide, starts off with an inauspicious gutter ball, down the leg side. Roy can't meet with his glanceJason Roy and Hales are at the crease. Jason Roy is on strike. Irfan will open the attackThe players have trudged out to the centre..Irfan is at the top of his mark rehearsing his action. It's a typical UAE crowd. Which means there isn't a crowd. If you discount the odd voices on offer. Play says the umpire and here we go. Two slips waitingTeams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Anwar Ali, Yasir Shah, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad IrfanEngland (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Reece TopleyAzhar: "We know it's a must-win game. We have two changes. Ahmed Shehzad and Yasir Shah are back. We want to win this game, everyone realizes that."Morgan: "We are going to have a bat today. The pitch looks pretty good, better than the first two grounds we have played on batting wise. Today is about opportunity. No team changes."England have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "That pitch is looking very similar to game 1 and game 2. Chuck that. But this is a good-looking pitch. Good balance between bat and ball it seems. Lots of grass and it is hard. The players will walk out and feel that they have something to work with," reckons Nick KnightHaving been broomed aside in the first match, Hales' century led a stunning counterattack to get England at par and Taylor-Buttler then followed suit with a brilliant partnership to take England 2-1 up. Pakistan haven't won since Yasir Shah's injury and will be keen to get him back in the fold, although Zafar Gohar, on debut, was impressive. Ahmed Shehzad might just get rid of that fluorescent yellow vest and slot in right at the top. England should ideally go in unchanged for this big game but you never know. Today is already historic then, even before a ball has been bowled (read: spun). Hang on for the pitch report, toss and team news from the spectacular Ring of Fire.There have been debates about how ODIs lack a genuine context, more so in the English cricket set-up seemingly mobbed by purists. But in this age of hosts-winning-world-cups and with the 2019 extravaganza all set to be held in England, this possible win will be all but significant. Andrew Strauss wanted to focus on England-in-ODIs and here England are 2-1 up and just on the brink, albeit helped by Pakistan's panic-stricken chases and hospitable runouts. Despite the fact that England swept the ODI series the last time they were here, this performance driven by the young blood is applause-worthy.13:52 Local Time, 09:52 GMT, 15:22 IST: Meteor showers and 4-match ODI rubbers are rare. England winning an ODI series is rarer. Rarest of all is England being on the verge of a victory in a spin paradise. With the news of Pakistan arriving three hours early at the stadium today, hello and welcome to the coverage of the fourth and final match between a stunned Pakistan and a surprisingly resurgent England.PreviewEngland would like to maintain the winning momentum and cap off their fightback with an emphatic series win against a struggling Pakistan as the two teams head to the Dubai International Cricket Stadium for the fourth and the final One-Day International (ODI) on Friday (November 20).Pakistan, on the other hand, find themselves in a do-or-die situation after having given England a chance to script a phenomenal come-from-behind series lead. Trailing 2-1 in the series, the hosts would be looking to salvage some pride in the final game to draw the four-match contest at a venue which hasn't particularly been a happy hunting ground for the 'hosts'.Pakistan have played 14 ODIs in Dubai since 2010 and have a 6-8 win-loss record. England incidentally have a cent percent record at this venue, having defeated Pakistan on both occasions the two teams clashed in February 2012.The English team management would be pleased to see each of their top six in the batting order, with the exception of Jos Butler who finished unbeaten on 49 in Sharjah, contributing with at least a half-century. Chris Woakes has led the bowling attack for the visitors and his twin four-for in the second and the third ODI have been instrumental in England's fightback."It was a magnificent win, we look to the next game to go on and win the series. We've earned the right to do that, so hopefully we can produce another performance like that," Eoin Morgan said, praising his batting unit ahead of the final game. "It's a huge step forward for us, particularly our middle order and our batting unit having absolute clarity in what we were doing and playing in the positive way in which we're trying to improve the way we play all the time," Morgan added.After losing the first ODI by six wickets, England came back hard at Pakistan with a thumping 95-run victory to level the series in Abu Dhabi, followed by another clinical all-round show to take a decisive 2-1 lead at Sharjah two days ago.Date: 20th November, 2015Venue: Dubai International Cricket StadiumWeather: A sunny Friday afternoon with a high of 29 degrees and 48 percent humidity.Team NewsPakistanPakistan would be fretting over the right team combination as they aim to restore pride in the final game. With the exception of Mohammad Hafeez and Babar Azam, their batting has let the team down and their bowling resources have taken a hit, with a knee injury to Yasir Shah ahead of the third match. Ahmed Shehzad, however, is likely make his national comeback after warming the bench so far in the series. The team management has been under fire from all corners over the exclusion of the explosive top-order batsman.Probable XI: Azhar Ali (Captain), Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Babar Azam, Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Rizwan, Sarfraz Ahmed (Wicket-keeper), Shoaib Malik, Wahab Riaz, Zafar Gohar, Anwar AliEnglandDespite the fact that opener Jason Roy and no. 3 bat Joe Root haven't looked at ease during the ODI series, England are unlikely to fiddle with their winning combination going into the final game. Star all-rounder Moeen Ali too hasn't chipped in enough so far, both with bat and ball, but is likely to retain his position in the playing XI.Probable XI: Eoin Morgan (Captain), Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler (Wicket-keeper), Alex Hales, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Jason Roy, James Taylor, Reece Topley, David Willey, Chris WoakesStats and TriviaOnly once a score of 300-plus has been registered at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium when South Africa posted 317/5 in 2010.
