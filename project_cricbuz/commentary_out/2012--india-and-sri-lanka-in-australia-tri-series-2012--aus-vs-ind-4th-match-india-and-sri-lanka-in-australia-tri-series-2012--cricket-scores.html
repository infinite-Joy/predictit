The first surprise, Ricky Ponting is openingPeter Forrest: I had an idea that I would be playing when Michael Hussey did not turn up in Adelaide. I am trying to think that it is just a game. When there are superstars in both teams, it is not easy to focus. I am trying to be confident. This feeling is similar to my first day in school. It was a little bit strange walking into the dressing room but now I cannot wait to get out and perform.Teams:India (Playing XI): Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Zaheer Khan, Vinay Kumar, Umesh YadavAustralia (Playing XI): David Warner, Matthew Wade(w), Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke(c), Peter Forrest, David Hussey, Daniel Christian, Ryan Harris, Clint McKay, Mitchell Starc, Xavier DohertyDhoni: We would have batted first. Tendulkar is not playing. Gambhir comes back and Umesh Yadav replaces Praveen Kumar. Ravindra Jadeja has done well and Ashwin has to step up. The win against SL was scrappy but we learnt a lot.Clarke: It is perfect conditions to bat. We have been playing very well but we still have lot of work to do. Michael Hussey is not playing and Peter Forrest comes in. He is been rested and Peter will bat at number four.Australia have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: Sanjay Manjrekar says that it is an excellent wicket to bat on. The grass is rolled in and it is dry grass. Wasim Akram reckons that if batsmen do not get runs here, they will not get runs anywhere. Teams that win the toss should bat first.Interesting Stat: India have never beaten Australia in an ODI at Adelaide.There are rumours floating around that Sachin Tendulkar might not play in today's ODI. Ravi Shastri is fuming as he calls this 'rotation' policy a joke. However, we will wait for official confirmation.Welcome to the 4th ODI of the CB series between Australia and India from Adelaide. Australia are sitting pretty at the top of the table after victories over India and Sri Lanka. Australia were tested in the previous match against the Lankans at Perth where they hung onto victory. They would be looking to put on a better show today in Adelaide. India, on the other hand, got going with a victory over Sri Lanka and they will want to put one over the Australians to boost their morale.Preview by Gokul GopalHaving secured wins at Melbourne and Perth, Australia now head to Adelaide to face India in the fourth match of the triangular series. While the Michael Clarke-led team won against India and Sri Lanka in their opening two matches, the MS Dhoni-led side managed to go past Sri Lanka. However, both Clarke and Dhoni will agree that the victories against Mahela Jayawardene's side were hardly convincing.Australia: After starting the series with a rousing 65-run victory over India, Australia faced a determined Sri Lankan side in the second match and somehow managed to overcome Angelo Mathews' heroics to pull off a 5-run win. Australia's batting was at its best in the opening match with Matthew Wade, David Hussey and Michael Hussey coming up with fine performances. However, the same cannot be said of Australia's efforts in the second game as the batsmen were not quite up to the mark. Only skipper Clarke showed some resolve with a hard-fought half-century as he tried to keep the batting unit together. But he was not given adequate support by the other players, and although the likes of Michael Hussey, David Hussey and Daniel Christian got off to starts, they did not stick around for a substantial amount of time for Australia to post a bigger total. Infact, it required Mitchell Starc and Clint McKay to hang around for a while to take Australia past 200.Once again, the focus has shifted to Ricky Ponting after failing in consecutive matches. David Warner might not be that much of a concern as he did manage to get off to good starts but the team will want him to go on to post some bigger scores. David Hussey seems to be in good form and will be key as Australia will be without his elder brother Michael Hussey, who was rested for the game. Clarke will be happy that he too found his touch after failing in the first game.Australia's bowling has been on the mark in both their games. It was Clint McKay who did the bulk of the damage against India, picking up four wickets while the likes of Mitchell Starc and Xavier Doherty also chipped in. Against Sri Lanka, all the bowlers managed to pick up wickets with Doherty being the most impressive of the lot. What has been the feature of the Australian bowling is that that they have never given up and they always keep coming at the batsmen. Michael Clarke will be hoping that they continue in the same vein throughout the series and also hope for the batters to come up with a combined effort. As far as the fielding goes, the sharpness of the Australian fielding and their catching skills can never be doubted.Team News: Australia rested Michael Hussey which means that Peter Forrest is likely to play his debut match. Mitchell Marsh could also get a game and given that he is capable with both bat and ball, he might come in for Ben Hilfenhaus who also has been rested.India: After the 4-0 blanking, many thought that India would do a lot better in the limited overs leg of the tour. But it has not been what you can call as an ideal outing for the World Champions. After receiving a thrashing in the opening match, India did not quite look in their elements in the second game despite emerging on the winning side. One of the reasons for India's indifferent performance in this series can be attributed to the form of the batters. None of the batsmen managed to put up a fight against Australia and they were bowled out for a mere 151 - Virat Kohli being the only batter to play well. In the second match too, it was Kohli's knock of 77 that kept India in the game. But it required the efforts of R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja to see the team through to a 4-wicket win as some terrible shot selection by the batsmen saw a cluster of wickets going down.Looking at the Indian batting, they are suffering the same kind of problems they had in the Test series. The openers have not been able to take the team off to good starts which has meant that the numbers 3, 4 and 5, instead of capitalizing on a start, have mostly been trying to consolidate. Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar between them have only scored 65 runs so far the the CB series, with Tendulkar managing 48 of them against Sri Lanka. Virat Kohli has been solid at number three with a couple of good batting performances. The ones to follow Kohli too have not made much of an impact in the series - Suresh Raina's has fallen to the short ball on a couple of occasions while Dhoni's presence in the middle order has hardly seemed like a strength so far. Indian batsmen need to show more application out in the middle in order to challenge the relentless Aussie attack.As far as India's bowling is concerned, they have done slightly better when compared to the batsmen. Although they gave away 216 runs in the first match against Australia, they did start off by picking up three quick wickets and Dhoni's policy of employing more spinners (including the part-timers), instead of opting for an extra seamer, hurt India in that game. Vinay Kumar impressed with his three wicket haul against Australia, R Ashwin finally found some form Down Under as he came up with a fine spell of 3/32 along with a vital contribution with the bat, which won him the Man of the Match award. Zaheer, who did not play the first match, was impressive in the second game while Praveen Kumar's bowling form has been a concern. Overall, India have a decent bowling attack that is capable of restricting the opposition and MS Dhoni will be expecting them to stick to their task of bowling the right line and lengths.Team News: India have employed the rotational policy at the top of the order so far which has meant that Sehwag and Gambhir were rested for a game each. Going by the trend, it is likely that Sachin Tendulkar might be rested for the Australia match although, going by the form of Sehwag and Gambhir throughout the tour, Tendulkar might remain in the eleven. Given the nature of the Adelaide pitch, Rahul Sharma, who bowled well against Australia and left-out against Sri Lanka, is likely to get a game.Numbers game:0: The number of matches India have won against Australia at the Adelaide Oval. They have lost all four matches against Australia here. Overall, they have played 11 matches at this ground and have won 6.2: The number of Indian batsmen to score an ODI century at the Adeialde Oval. Sourav Ganguly scored 141 against Pakistan in 2000 while VVS Laxman scored 131 against Zimbabwe in the year 2004.
