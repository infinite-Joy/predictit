AUSTRALIA:25.4 25.4Andre Fletcher to Warner, 2 runs, there's the win. A bonus point win for Australia to start their Caribbean tourney. Warner has just catalysed West Indies's self-fabricated downing, not effected it. Not tonight. On a length was this leg-cutter, not turning viciously.

AUSTRALIA:19.4 Narine to Maxwell, out Bowled!! Wait, what? Maxwell had left a bat-pad gap so big that a set of stumps could make its way through, this was just a five-and-a-half ounce ball. Sharp turn, admittedly, as Maxwell was drwan across to drive this ball that pitches way outside off and rips in to clip the top of middle. Nowhere behind the ball and the stumps take a pounding. West Indies have an opening. Maxwell b Narine 0(2)Narine to Maxwell, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
AUSTRALIA:19.3 Narine to Maxwell, no run, gets forward and defends itGlenn Maxwell, right handed bat, comes to the creaseMaxwell.. How Universe conspires an early finish..

Pitches right near Smith's front boot as the batsman misses the clip and turns in sharply to rap the pad. Immediate appeal, like always, and the umpire obliged as quick as he could. HawkEye reckons that would have missed leg. Smith lbw b Narine 6(10) [4s-1]Narine to Smith, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!

AUSTRALIA:16.6 Benn to Khawaja, out Caught by Holder!! That's what you get when you bowl to Santa Claus - a wicket gift-wrapped. Khawaja was just early to tuck this tame delivery threatening the pad. Made sure that the ball didn't pop up to short mid-wicket by taking his bottom hand off as he swiveled but the ball did find a way. He was way way early into the shot, with the replays suggesting that his bat was protracted a feet or two in front of his body. That early.

AUSTRALIA:15.5 Brathwaite to Khawaja, no run, back to round the wicket, full and outside off, Khawaja takes his bottom hand off as he defends it and then stares back at the bowler. Don't know why.

AUSTRALIA:13.5 Brathwaite to Warner, no run, drama. Okay, not so much. But action, yes. Warner was late to tuck a back of a length delivery away as the ball shot on from the pitch.

AUSTRALIA:10.1 Narine to Warner, 1 run, this off-break turns from leg to off, as Narine bowls it from over the wicket. Warner opens up and punches into the off-sideNow, the action is live. I probably jumped the gun five minutes early.. Need a new watch (and a good raise) perhaps. The players are on the field. Warner's on strike and Narine, as expected, has the ball. It looks a touch darkerWelcome back. Australia have been ruthless so far, and so has been the pitch, with its sticky disposition inhibiting the runs.. but not for Australia so far. Warner has shoplifted runs with his IPL form and quick running, while Khawaja's timing looks set to compensate for Finch's - his rival for the opening spot - struggles. The bonus point is in the reckoning. Now over to Narine to waterjug this speeding Australian motorcade.If Australia hunt the target down before 40 overs, they will get a bonus point. Warner and Finch have provided a solid start for the Aussies. Despite Finch throwing away his wicket, they are cruising towards the target. Let's see if they succeed in grabbing a bonus point. Join us back in a while.

Narine will open the attackWelcome back for the chase. The players are out in the middle. Sunil Narine to start the proceedings.A tacky pitch indeed, so far for the West Indies. From 50/2 to the abyss of 116 all out. Mitch Starc roared into a comeback, snaffling Fletcher early before fizzling out into undisciplined lines and lengths. On a pitch expected to spin, which it did, the twosome of Lyon and Zampa shared six wickets in total. Pollard's innings lasted a ball, Holder's five more, but Carlos Brathwaite persisted in the end, only to delay the end that was pretty evident from the mess of wickets falling around him. Now over to Narine to tackle Australia tactfully on this tacky wicket. Join us back!3

WEST INDIES:16.2 Lyon to Pollard, out Caught by Warner!! I think someone sent Pollard for some other match not this one. Some match where the slog overs are in progress or the team needs some 50 off 3 overs. I am sure about this. Why on earth would he try to go over the top to a spinner who has been turning them big and has just devoured Samuels. But who am I to judge his approach? Pollard tries to go over the top, does not get it off the meat of the bat too. Was nowhere to the pitch of the ball and handed a candy to Warner at long-on. Hat-trick ball coming up. Pollard c Warner b Lyon 0(1)Lyon to Pollard, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Kieron Pollard, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:16.1 Lyon to Samuels, out Lbw!! Drifted this from round the wicket and got it to turn in. Samuels was glued in his crease as he tried to nurdle it. Missed the turn and was struck right in front, did well to not rob his teammates of a review. Pollard is here now. Samuels lbw b Lyon 10(14)Lyon to Samuels, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Samuels is thinking, thinking and thinking some more. Consults Ramdin as well but won't review this lbw call
WEST INDIES:15.6 Starc to Samuels, 1 run, Samuels pushes this length delivery to mid-on and sets off, the fielder there as a quick arm and he releases it quickly to shatter the stumps at the bowler's end.

WEST INDIES:14.6 Lyon to Samuels, 2 runs, lets this one turn in and tucks it to fine leg, who has to do a bit of work to his right. Two on offer with ease

WEST INDIES:13.5 Starc to Samuels, 2 runs, Samuels slices the drive on this full toss, Lyon at sweeper cover puts in a dive to his right and does well to save two for his team
WEST INDIES:13.4 Starc to Ramdin, 1 run, Starc dropped it short and put in some shoulder. That 146 mark was a testimony, Ramdin cuts it to third man. It was in the air for a while but away from backward point
WEST INDIES:13.3 Starc to Ramdin, no run, full deliveries look so lethal with all that pace. Ramdin drives it with a full face of the bat to mid-on
WEST INDIES:13.2 Starc to Ramdin, no run, another inswinging full toss, Ramdin knocks it to mid-onDenesh Ramdin, right handed bat, comes to the creaseThe players in the meantime took drinks as well
WEST INDIES:13.1 Starc to Charles, out Bowled!! That's the delivery which Bumrah bowled to get rid of Gayle in the World T20 semifinal. I am sure this one was a bit quicker though. Full swinging in and Charles's angled bat is not the response it would have respected. Charles might have got an inside edge as well. Middle-stump has done its share of exercise by jogging back. Charles b Starc 22(40) [4s-1 6s-1]Starc to Charles, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
WEST INDIES:13.1 Starc to Charles, wide, fuller length delivery down the leg-side, called a wideMitchell Starc [3.0-0-21-1] is back into the attack

WEST INDIES:12.1 Lyon to Charles, no run, big appeal for an lbw but the umpire is not interested. The ball pitched just outside the off-stump
WEST INDIES:12.1 Lyon to Samuels, 2 wides, Lyon slips this one down the leg and Wade does not collect cleanly, batsmen change ends as well
WEST INDIES:11.6 Mitchell Marsh to Samuels, 3 runs, that's some running between the duo, Samuels tucks this straight ball fine after moving across a bit. The man at fine leg has to do a bit of work and that is enough for Samuels to add three to his total
WEST INDIES:11.5 Mitchell Marsh to Samuels, no run, Just a while ago Djokovic won the French Open and here is Marsh reminding of tennis bounce. Bowls a bumper right at Samuels, who bends back and leaves it well

WEST INDIES:11.3 Mitchell Marsh to Samuels, no run, steers this back of a length to the right of the man at slip, who attempts a throw at the striker's end. Samuels was well in, would not have mattered as the man missed the target

WEST INDIES:11.1 Mitchell Marsh to Darren Bravo, out Caught by Zampa!! For every bit of recklessness that Charles showed, Bravo has to pay the price. Bravo is to be blamed for this one though. The pitch is holding up a bit but he decides to play an on the rise drive, does not keep it down and the ball goes straight into the hands of cover. Zampa there was not very clean with it, fumbled a bit but to the delight of the visitors, was able to hold onto it on the second attempt. Darren Bravo c Zampa b Mitchell Marsh 19(31) [4s-3]Mitchell Marsh to Darren Bravo, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
WEST INDIES:10.6 Lyon to Charles, no run, similar shot on a similar delivery but this time straight to Finchy there
WEST INDIES:10.5 Lyon to Charles, 2 runs, bit of work to do for Finch as he runs from backward square leg to stop this clip from Charles
WEST INDIES:10.4 Lyon to Charles, no run, too much of turn this time and Charles misses the tuck, the ball hits him high on his front thigh
WEST INDIES:10.3 Lyon to Charles, no run, inside edge again, Charles wanted to force it towards the off-side, was lucky that did not drag it back
WEST INDIES:10.2 Lyon to Charles, no run, he was way outside his crease trying to go over the top so this appeal from Lyon did not make much sense
WEST INDIES:10.1 Lyon to Charles, no run, airs this on around off, Charles pushes it to cove
WEST INDIES:9.6 Mitchell Marsh to Darren Bravo, no run, tries to angle this one from wide of the crease, does so. But the line was still wide enough for Bravo to shoulder arms
WEST INDIES:9.5 Mitchell Marsh to Darren Bravo, no run, only if you got runs for hitting good drives and not finding gaps. Bravo leans into this one and goes for a full-blooded one, straight to the fielder at mid-off
WEST INDIES:9.4 Mitchell Marsh to Darren Bravo, no run, width on offer and Bravo wanted to peel it away towards point. The ball bounced over his swishing bat and into the hands of the keeper

WEST INDIES:8.6 Lyon to Darren Bravo, 1 run, short is not the way to go here, Lyon thinks otherwise, Bravo proves him wrong and cuts to sweeper cover. By the way, Lyon was given two short extra covers for Darren Bravo. Did not fetch much though
WEST INDIES:8.5 Lyon to Darren Bravo, no run, which over are we in? This one turns a lot outside off, Bravo does not budge
WEST INDIES:8.4 Lyon to Charles, 1 run, Charles has the luck of entire Windies tonight, gets an inside edge this time trying to work it towards square leg, the ball rolls to short third man for a single
WEST INDIES:8.3 Lyon to Charles, SIX, how can you bowl full to me, man? Charles steps down and flumps it over the deep mid-wicket fence
WEST INDIES:8.2 Lyon to Charles, no run, turn, great. Fuller as well, Charles inside edges the drive on his pads
WEST INDIES:8.1 Lyon to Darren Bravo, 1 run, enough time and space for Bravo to go back and cut it to sweeper cover
WEST INDIES:7.6 Mitchell Marsh to Charles, no run, shortish. Not that much but enough for Charles to whip the pull, cannot beat square leg though
WEST INDIES:7.5 Mitchell Marsh to Charles, no run, length ball just outside off, Charles pats it to cover
WEST INDIES:7.4 Mitchell Marsh to Darren Bravo, 1 run, that tackiness off the pitch, Bravo was early on the drive even as Marsh came round the wicket. Darren Bravo was lucky that it did not carry to the man at short cover, just out of his reach towards right

WEST INDIES:6.4 Lyon to Charles, no run, flatter ball from Lyon, Charles nudges it towards the on-side
WEST INDIES:6.3 Lyon to Charles, no run, there was a big inside edge, I think. Nopes, there was not any contact with the bat, my eyes I tell you. Charles was stuck in his crease as he tried to nudge this one, missed it and was struck on the back leg. Since the Aussies do not have a review left, there was not much they could do
WEST INDIES:6.2 Lyon to Darren Bravo, 1 run, turn but the length is not quite there, Bravo cuts it past a diving cover for a single
WEST INDIES:6.1 Lyon to Darren Bravo, no run, tossed up delivery on the stumps, Bravo drives it towards cover. There is a slip in the form of captainNathan Lyon, right-arm off break, comes into the attackSpin for the first time in this match. Lyon to have a roar
WEST INDIES:5.6 Hazlewood to Charles, no run, looked like a slower ball to me. Charles stays in his crease and blocks it back to the bowler
WEST INDIES:5.5 Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, 1 run, back of a length from Hazlewood, Bravo hops back and tucks in front of square leg for a quick single. Would a direct hit at the striker's end been interesting? Maybe
WEST INDIES:5.4 Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no run, chops this back of a length on the drive towards the man at short extra cover
WEST INDIES:5.3 Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, FOUR, can he dispatch those clouds like he has cracked this one from Hazlewood? Short ball and Darren Bravo made a bit of room and then flat batted the pull through square leg with disdain
WEST INDIES:5.3 Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no ball, Hazlewood has overstepped this time. The ball was a good one, on the stumps which compelled Bravo to defend it. Free hit coming, and so are the clouds

WEST INDIES:4.4 Starc to Darren Bravo, FOUR, that's crunchier than a walnut. Half-volley and it did not swing, Bravo leant into it and drove past cover, head nicely over the ball. Everything right about it
WEST INDIES:4.3 Starc to Darren Bravo, no run, Starc gets it right finally, back of a length on the stumps. Bravo tucks in front of mid-wicket and yells a loud "No" to stop his partner who was interested in a single
WEST INDIES:4.3 Starc to Darren Bravo, wide, this has not been the kind of over we are used to seeing from this man. He bowls it well wide of the tramline outside off and it has been called a wide
WEST INDIES:4.2 Starc to Darren Bravo, no run, nice shape on this one from Starc, Bravo is drawn into the drive. Gets beatenFolks, that edge did not bisect the keeper and the slip, it burst through the hands of slip as he dived to his left
WEST INDIES:4.2 Starc to Darren Bravo, wide, slips this one down the leg-side
WEST INDIES:4.1 Starc to Darren Bravo, FOUR, full toss and Bravo does not miss out. Carves this one away from a diving backward point

Charles threw his bat this fuller length and got a thick edge, which bisected the keeper and the lone slipOh, one of those men from slip has been taken offThere are two slips in place, who are standing pretty close
WEST INDIES:3.5 Hazlewood to Charles, no run, length delivery on the stumps, Charles pushes it back to the bowler
WEST INDIES:3.4 Hazlewood to Charles, no run, another straight ball which Charles fails to tuck towards the on-side, gets hit high on the thigh
WEST INDIES:3.3 Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, 1 run, those two leaves propelled Hazlewood to pitch it too straight, Bravo tucks it to fine leg to change ends
WEST INDIES:3.2 Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no run, this time, though, it is far wide of that off stump and Bravo did not dither before leaving it
WEST INDIES:3.1 Hazlewood to Darren Bravo, no run, how close was that one from the off-pole, close enough to get Hazlewood interested but wide enough for Darren Bravo to leave
WEST INDIES:2.6 Starc to Darren Bravo, 1 run, fired full on the pads of Bravo, who gets an inside edge on the clip. The ball rolls towards fine leg for a single
WEST INDIES:2.5 Starc to Darren Bravo, no run, slightly back of a length with a bit of width to tempt Bravo, who did not look interested in it as he shouldered arms
WEST INDIES:2.5 Starc to Darren Bravo, wide, this is a bit wayward. Starc has slid this one down the leg-side and it will be called a wide
WEST INDIES:2.4 Starc to Darren Bravo, no run, Starc is not afraid to pitch them quite full, more than half-volleys those. Bravo gets his stride forward and push-drives towards the cover region
WEST INDIES:2.3 Starc to Darren Bravo, no run, Starc is asking questions. But this time it was a little too optimistic, Bravo moved across a bit but still the ball which struck his thigh, would have slid down the leg-side
WEST INDIES:2.2 Starc to Charles, 1 run, Starc slants this one away from Charles and induces edge on the push. There is only one slip in place so no chance for a catch, third man hurls it back
WEST INDIES:2.1 Starc to Charles, 2 runs, the outfield is not that quick so Charles won't get the worth for his one-handed drive, which he executed on this fuller length delivery. The man from cover chased it down in time
WEST INDIES:1.6 Hazlewood to Charles, 1 run, fuller length inswing delivery, Charles turns it with the angle towards fine leg to retain the strike for the next over
WEST INDIES:1.5 Hazlewood to Charles, no run, shortish delivery that allowed Charles the time to drag the whip from outside off. He was not able to beat a diving mid-on to his right though
WEST INDIES:1.4 Hazlewood to Charles, no run, this time Hazlewood hits the length and keeps it in the channel outside off, Charles pats it softly towards the cover region
WEST INDIES:1.3 Hazlewood to Charles, no run, short of a good length on middle and off, Charles prods forward and blocks
WEST INDIES:1.2 Hazlewood to Charles, no run, shapes this one outside off and lured Charles into the drive. Charles was lucky that he did not edge it towards the men behind the stumpsTwo slips for Hazlewood
WEST INDIES:1.1 Hazlewood to Charles, no run, some movement for Hazlewood as well, just outside off. Charles does the wise thing, lets it goJosh Hazlewood, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackGood to see that Starc has not lost that late inswing and yorker- the art which made him the bowler he is
WEST INDIES:0.6 Starc to Darren Bravo, no run, swing again for Starc, right on the money at the stumps. Bravo does well and presents the full face of the bat as he pushes it past the bowler towards mid-onDarren Bravo, left handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:0.5 Starc to Andre Fletcher, out Caught by Maxwell!! Starc does not have to wait for long. He has his man. Fletcher is gone, fuller length from Starc as he always does with the new ball. Gets the ball to curl in a bit, Fletcher was never looking to keep the drive grounded. Unfortunately sliced it and found Maxi at backward point, who reverse cupped it with ease. Andre Fletcher c Maxwell b Starc 4(4) [4s-1]Starc to Andre Fletcher, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
WEST INDIES:0.4 Starc to Andre Fletcher, no run, fuller length delivery on the stumps, Fletcher swings through the line but cannot beat mid-on
WEST INDIES:0.4 Starc to Andre Fletcher, no ball, FOUR, that is too high and Fletcher flashes at it, gets a thickish edge that flies past slip cordon into the third man fence. Free hit coming up
WEST INDIES:0.3 Starc to Andre Fletcher, no run, Smith wants to review this one. Front foot is fine. But there is a big inside edge so Fletcher will stay. It was a big inswinging yorker that tailed in a long way to hit Fletcher on the pad but before that it had kissed his inside edge. The umpire saw it and denied the lbw appeal but Starc convinced Smith to review it, resulting in a wasted one
WEST INDIES:0.2 Starc to Charles, 1 run, Charles is not going to see of those, there was a bit of room outside off and he threw his bat it. It was in the air for a while as it passed point but no harm there, third man does the fielding out there
WEST INDIES:0.1 Starc to Charles, no run, full ball just outside off, swung in a bit. Charles blocks towards pointCharles and Andre Fletcher are at the crease. Charles is on strike. Starc will open the attackStarc has the ball. There is a slipThe players and the officials are out there observing a minute's silence to the legendary Tony Cozier, who passed away few weeks agoStarc: "It is nice to be back with the boys. I guess I know what I am coming from and what I have to do to get back. I am looking forward to come back after 6 months. As I said, we have a bit of layoff Australia wise after New Zealand and World T20. At the moment, we are just focussed on this tour. West Indies will be aware of the situation out here. We knew it was going to turn, we have been practicing some spin and practicing on subcontinental type of wickets back at home.""The pitch has been very slow and it is going to be the same. The bowlers will look to bowl back of a driving length. It will start turning early as well," Jeff Dujon says in his pitch report.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Usman Khawaja, David Warner, Steven Smith(c), Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan LyonWest Indies (Playing XI): Johnson Charles, Andre Fletcher, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Kieron Pollard, Carlos Brathwaite, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Sunil Narine, Sulieman BennJason Holder: "It is a bit tacky as he said. We gave ourselves some chance in the last game. We would like to continue doing that. We are keeping the same team."Steven Smith: "We are going to have a bowl. It is a bit humid out here so hopefully we will look for swing. We have got Starc back. It is a bit tacky as well, so it will turn a bit as well. It was a nice little trip from Australia. We had a stopover at New York."Australia have won the toss and have opted to fieldThere are a few areas on the outfield which the umpires are particularly worried about. Looking at those patches, it seems we might be in for a 40-45 minute delayThere were some early morning showers and the play is expected to be delayed. Though it won't be a long delay as the conditions have improved since then and the umpires will have an inspection at 12:50 localWest Indies were dominant in the tournament opener against the Proteas. Interestingly, the heores of the match were those who did not feature in the World T20. Sunil Narine and Kieron Pollard used their IPL form and staved off the African challenge with rather ease. Today, all eyes, as mentioned in the preview which you can read below, will be on Mitchell Starc. It's been long since we last saw him. His ankle injury kept him out of action from the World T20 and then he missed the IPL as well. Australia will be hoping that he finds his form as well, for the Aussie attack looks completely different with him in flow. Stay tuned, we will have the pitch report and toss in a while...11:59 Local Time, 15:59 GMT, 21:29 IST: Hello everyone. I cannot tell you how happy I am to be covering an ODI match after so long. Ok, ok... I know that this is the second match of the series. But to tell you the truth I was not there for the first game. I, Abhishek Chaudhary, along with my awesome colleagues Raju, Pratyush, Sriram and Pradeep will be bringing you all the details as the hosts West Indies take on Australia todayPreview:Sunil Narine and Kieron Pollard, both making their national comeback, played pivotal roles in West Indies' four-wicket upset win over South Africa in the tri-series opener. On Sunday (June 5), however, all eyes would be on Australia's comeback man.As Australia eye a winning start to their new season, against hosts West Indies in the second One-Day International of the series, pace spearhead Mitchell Starc is all set to resume national duties, after spending more than six months on the sidelines following the freak ankle injury in the historic day-night Test against New Zealand last November.High on confidence after defeating favourites South Africa, the home team, however, would be hoping to carry the momentum forward as they lock horns against the reigning 50-over champions, at the Providence Stadium in Guayana.Despite the home advantage and their recent success at the 2016 ICC world Twenty20, West Indies entered the tournament as underdogs. Buoyed by the successful return of Narine and Pollard, the hosts, placed eighth in the rankings table, toppled third-ranked South African unit by four wickets.Narine, back after successfully remodelling his bowling action, ran through the visitors' batting order. Barring Rilee Rossouw, who made 83-ball 61, none of the other batsman were able to convert their starts as Narine's six-wicket haul kept them to 188. Imran Tahir's twin strikes in quick succession had reduced the home team to 76 for four in a moderate chase before the other comeback man - Pollard hit an unbeaten run-a-ball 67 to help West Indies collect four points.The pitch at the Providence Stadium assisted spin throughout the first game, and it wouldn't be a surprise if Australia opt to field both legspinner Adam Zampa as well as offpsinner Nathan Lyon in their playing XI.The batting will be led by David Warner, who hit a purple patch at the recently concluded ninth edition of the Indian Premier League. With 848 runs in 17 outings, Warner finished as season's second-best batsman, only after Virat Kohli, and led from the front as Sunrisers Hyderabad lifted their maiden silverware.Aaron Finch had also been amongst runs but Usman Khawaja and George Bailey, both called in as replacements for injured Rising Pune Supergiants' players, haven't spent enough time in he middle lately. One of the causalities was, indeed, the Australian skipper Steve Smith who seems to have recovered well in time but lacks game-time.Chris Gayle, Andre Russell, Dwayne Bravo and Darren Sammy - home team's four limited-overs specialists have all been overlooked, but Pollard, Marlon Samuels and their World T20 hero Carlos Brathwaite make up for their absence.When: West Indies vs Australia, 2nd Match, Tri-series on June 5 at 1:00 PM Local TimeWhere: Providence Stadium, GuyanaWhat to expect: Thunderstorms are predicted on the day of the gameTeam newsWest Indies: Both Narine and Pollard made a successful comeback to national team and having defeated favourites South Africa a day ago, the hosts are unlikely to tinker with their winning combination.Australia: Starc is set for his national comeback after a lengthy injury lay-off. Given the way the pitch played out in the series opener, Adam Zampa, who impressed in the ninth edition of IPL, is likely to find a spot in the playing XI along with Nathan Lyon.Who said what"They are the two guys who took the game away from South Africa, and it showed that they're very important to our cricket. Narine himself, coming back from everything he's been through, to come and perform the way he did today, you have to give him a lot of kudos for his grit and his determination, to come out of where he's been and to come back and perform like this. Pollard's experience showed there, his ability to hit the ball but also his experience to guide young Bravo and so on through the end," Phil Simmons, West Indies coach, on Narine and Pollard's match-winning efforts"Having six months off, although it was through injury, was nice to refresh a little bit and go through what I have to do in terms of cricket and strength wise. It was nice to spend three or four months in the gym to get that strength back that I'd lost over 12 to 18 months of cricket. I think I've ticked all those boxes and that hunger has definitely come back a lot stronger than it was at the end of that Ashes series."
