NZ should not aim too big. 260-270 should be a good score considering it will spin later on. Yusuf Pathan is a sort of player who can hit any ball, but the way he constructed an innings was good to see. He will get a lot of positives by winning a match on his own. NZ should do something different, they should stick to the basics, they have struggled when the pressure is on. If NZ lose today, they will end the tour of Ind and Bangladesh 0-9. That is an awful feeling for the team. Getting to bat first and putting the runs on the board should be the way to go for NZ.Teams:India (Playing XI): Gautam Gambhir(c), Parthiv Patel(w), Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Saurabh Tiwary, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Ashish Nehra, Munaf PatelNew Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(w), Martin Guptill, Jamie How, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Grant Elliott, James Franklin, Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Tim SoutheeGambhir: We want to be the number One side in ODIs so every game is important. We wanted to bat as well had we won the toss. At this level, a victory in every game counts, we are a young side, if we play every game as a first game, we have to give everything we've got. We have Munaf coming in place of Zak who has been rested.Vettori: There is enough to suggest that it would be a good batting wicket. The bowlers need to step up and make it count, our batting unit has done very well. It is tough bowling here, and if you bowl badly we will definitely get hurt. Our batsmen played with good intent in Bangalore, we are looking at an all-round package today.New Zealand have won the toss and elected to batAverage first innings score is 285 here and when a side has made 285, the team has gone on to win the game 4 times.Pitch report: It's nice and hard, there is not much of grass on the wicket. It won't seam around a lot but there would be a bit of turn in it for the spinners. With the new ball it is going to be crucial for both sides to make it count as the ball would zip through the deck. The gaps in between the grand stands would ensure that the breeze may blow into the stadium, considering the fact that the Marina Beach is just a stone's throw from the stadium. The weathermen predict that there could be some rain later on in the evening so the D/L Method could come into play. Simon Doull feels that the captain winning the toss may want to bowl.As we speak, it has gone a bit overcast, but play is expected to start on time, something that looked very unlikely when we witnessed record rain over the past week or so.News from the Kiwi camp is that Grant Elliot is expected to come in place of Andy McKay.Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the 5th and final ODI of the series coming to you live from Chepauk, in Chennai. The first and foremost thing on everyone's mind is the weather, and I can tell you that as of now there is bright sunshine. There hasn't been any rains since the last couple of days, but the met department has predicted that there could be a chance of rain later on in the evening. The Indians have made it very clear that they would like to give the youngsters a run, keeping in mind the World Cup, while the Kiwis would be looking to end the series on a winning note. This is Shashank, who would be bringing you all the action as it unfolds in the company of Ajith and Srivathsa. Stay connected for all the action!Preview by Saurabh SomaniAfter the demoralizing defeat in the fourth ODI, New Zealand must be left wondering what on earth they need to do to win an ODI. They did everything right for large parts of the last match - they batted well and posted a huge total, then they bowled well to take out the Indian top-order. However, the most astute captains and skillful bowlers cannot make plans for an assault of the kind Yusuf Pathan launched, and Vettori and co must have been left scratching their heads in searching for an answer on how to win an ODI.
The series is lost, but New Zealand have now reached a stage where merely a win will be looked at as an achievement. When they last won an ODI, Mohammad Aamer was still the most exciting young talent world cricket had thrown up and the words 'spot-fixing' had not yet entered the everyday cricketing lexicon. Yes, that's how far back it was.
Daniel Vettori will need to exhort his team to put the last ODI behind them, and New Zealand will doubtless tell themselves that innings of the kind Pathan played are not the stuff of everyday cricket, and if they play as well as they did in the fourth ODI, they can expect to win more often than not. However, they must expect more from their top order. They reached the total they did thanks to James Franklin, and he can't be expected to contribute in every match. The top-order batting for New Zealand, must therefore assume more responsibility and take the onus to put on big scores. New Zealand had dropped the talented young Kane Williamson for the previous ODI in favour of Jamie How, and maybe they would do well to reverse that decision here.
Their bowling also needs to be tightened, though you can't blame the bowlers much when the tracks are flat as they are and the opposing batting line-up is as strong as India's is.
India will be very upbeat going into the match, and confident of their chances of a 5-0 whitewash. A clean sweep would be the ideal way to not just prepare for the World Cup, but also send a message to other teams about India's strength at home. After all, they have won four games without the services of Sehwag, Tendulkar, Dhoni or Harbhajan. Moreover, Zaheer was absent in the first two ODIs, and an in-form Sreesanth has been rested for the next two.
India is likely to go in unchanged from the side that played the fourth ODI, which means Saurabh Tiwary and Rohit Sharma may get one more chance to make claims for a more permanent slot. Yusuf Pathan, of course, has all but sealed his spot in India's World Cup side, which will make the competition for the few remaining spots all the more intense.
Looking at the present strength of both teams, the most likely threat to avert a 5-0 sweep for India appears to be the Chennai weather. It has been unusually cold in Chennai with heavy rains. However, two days before the match the skies cleared up. The weather prediction is for scattered thunderstorms, and the Chennai fans will pray that they are scattered enough to not disrupt play.Teams:India (From): Gautam Gambhir(c), Parthiv Patel(w), Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Saurabh Tiwary, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Ashish Nehra, Munaf Patel, Zaheer Khan, Murali Vijay, Ravindra JadejaNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(w), Martin Guptill, Jamie How, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, James Franklin, Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Tim Southee, Andy McKay, Gareth Hopkins, Kane Williamson, Grant ElliottLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
