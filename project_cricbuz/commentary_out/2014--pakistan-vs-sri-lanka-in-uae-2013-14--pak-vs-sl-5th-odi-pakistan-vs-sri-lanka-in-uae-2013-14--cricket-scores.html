The first ball coming up....The pitch is very slow and the ball is not coming onto the bat. With three spinners in their attack, Pakistan should fancy their chances. As for Sri Lanka, the new ball will be the key. If they get off to a good start then they can chase it down easily. Join us back in 30 minutes for the run chase.....Sri Lanka have done well to bowl the hosts out inside 50 overs. After electing to bat, Pakistan lost Shehzad early and Sharjeel also didn't hang around much. However, Hafeez and Misbah steadied the innings before the latter got out. The skipper continued his fine form to notch up his 15th ODI fifty this year, but he too went after getting a start. A few lusty blows from Ali at the end propelled them past 200, which looked too far away at one stage. Malinga was the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers with four wickets and the rest of them contributed with some tight bowling at the other end.4

We have only change in our squad."Misbah: "We are going to bat first. It looks more drier than the previous ones. So we will look to put up a good score on the board. Afridi had to go back home and Rehman replaces him, Anwar Ali comes in for Bilawal Bhatti."Pitch Report: "It is a dry pitch. There are some cracks around but it will not cause any problems. Playing shots will be difficult as the pitch will be slow", says Russel ArnoldTeams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Ashan Priyanjan, Angelo Mathews(c), Kithuruwan Vithanage, Sachithra Senanayake, Ajantha Mendis, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith MalingaPakistan (Playing XI): Sharjeel Khan, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sohaib Maqsood, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal(w), Saeed Ajmal, Anwar Ali, Umar Gul, Abdur Rehman, Junaid KhanThis ODI will see the introduction of Officiating Replay System (ORS). The ORS is another one of ICC's experiment to improve the DRS. The third umpire will have control over this and he does not have to depend upon the replays provided by the broadcasters.Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batHello and welcome to the final ODI match between these two teams. The series has already been decided, with Pakistan winning it 3-1. However, there is still lot to play for, Sri Lanka would not want the scoreline be 4-1 and will want to finish the series on a high. They have been battered and hammered in the series and one man in particular has been a thorn for them, Mohammad Hafeez, who has scored 3 hundreds and all three came when the team needed it. The only match he didn't score was the one which Pakistan lost. With Shahid Afridi already been rested, the hosts will look to give some of the others a chance. We will have to wait and see what Sri Lanka do with their team composition. Toss and teams in a short while, stay tuned.....Preview by Gokul GopalAfter taking an unassailable 3-1 lead with a comfortable win in the fourth ODI, Pakistan will be looking at a 4-1 finish when they take on Sri Lanka in the final ODI in Abu Dhabi. For the visitors, this match gives them an opportunity to restore some of the lost pride and gain some confidence ahead of the three-Test series.Pakistan: Pakistan have clinched their second ODI series in a row and the one responsible their latest series win is Mohammad Hafeez. After a forgettable ODI series against South Africa, Hafeez, who was dropped for the Tests, made a strong statement by scoring three terrific hundreds against Sri Lanka. He has received good support from Ahmed Shehzad, who has been in good form while Sohaib Maqsood has also done well. The rest of the batters too have pitched in with useful knocks and skipper Misbah-ul-Haq will be hoping that they continue in the same vein.Junaid Khan has been Pakistan's top wicket-taker in this series while Umar Gul, who joined the team in the middle of the series, has picked up back-to-back three wicket hauls. Saeed Ajmal, who has been economical, did not have much to speak for his efforts early in the series. However, two wickets in the third ODI and four wickets in the fourth would have done a world of good for the off-spinner's confidence and he will be looking to do more damage. Hafeez too has done a decent job with the ball while Bilawal Bhatti, who has had a poor series, could be termed as the only weak-link in the Pakistan bowling attack.Sri Lanka: After fighting performances in the first two ODIs, the form of the Sri Lankan batters has taken a dip. The batsmen have not been able to contribute collectively, failing to build partnerships, which has hurt Sri Lanka. While some of them have managed to score half-centuries, they found themselves in a position where others have not been giving them support, which has led to collapses. With the series already out of their hands, skipper Angelo Mathews will be hoping for the batsmen use this match to find form ahead of the Test series.The Lankan bowlers too haven't done much in this series and Lasith Malinga, with only two wickets and an economy of 6.35, has been the biggest disappointment of them all. Nuwan Kulasekara is not too far either in terms of economy, and has taken the same number of wickets as Malinga. Other seamers like Suranga Lakmal and Thisara Perera have also been very expensive while Mathews is the only seamer with a decent economy rate. The spinners Sachitra Senanayake and Seekkuge Prasanna have been good and Sri Lanka will be hoping for the quicker bowlers emulate the efforts of the spinners.Team News: Shahid Afridi has opted out of the fifth ODI to be with his ailing daughter. Pakistan might look at giving either Anwar Ali or Haris Sohail a game in the absence of the all-rounder. Ashan Priyanjan, who impressed in the previous game, scoring a half-century on debut, will, in all likelihood, be persisted with by Sri Lanka while the visitors may also look to retain Kithuruwan Vithanage. Prasanna, who was left out for the 4th ODI, may return in place of Kulasekara or Lakmal.Numbers:60: The number of wickets taken by Saeed Ajmal in ODIs this year. He requires three more wickets to go up to the third place for bowlers with most wickets in a calender year. A five-wicket haul for Ajmal would put him joint-second with Saqlain Mushtaq, who also tops the list.1322: The number of runs scored by Misbah-ul-Haq in ODIs in 2013. He requires 41 more runs to dislodge Mohammad Yousuf from the second place on the list of Pakistani batsmen with most runs in a calender year. Saeed Anwar, with 1595 runs, tops that list.7: The number of ODI series Pakistan have won this year. This is their best performance in a year as they surpassed their 6 ODI series wins in 2011.Quotes:The confidence we got from our South Africa win helped us in this series. It was a big motivation to win in South Africa for the first time and we carried that momentum here: Mohammad Hafeez.We had couple of see-saw games early on but the last few games we were well short of our standard. We will have to play for our pride in the last game, win it and end the series on a good note: Angelo Mathews.Teams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Anwar Ali, Bilawal Bhatti, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal(w), Junaid Khan, Saeed Ajmal, Sharjeel Khan, Sohaib Maqsood, Sohail Tanvir, Haris Sohail, Abdur Rehman, Asad Shafiq, Umar GulSri Lanka (From): Dinesh Chandimal, Lasith Malinga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Kithuruwan Vithanage, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Suranga Lakmal, Sachithra Senanayake, Ajantha Mendis, Dimuth Karunaratne, Ashan PriyanjanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
