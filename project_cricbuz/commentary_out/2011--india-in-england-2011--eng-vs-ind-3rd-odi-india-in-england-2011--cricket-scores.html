India have fought back well thanks to a rearguard action by Dhoni and Jadeja and some smart hitting at the end by Ashwin. They will look to take some early wickets with the new ball. Stay tuned for England's chaseJames Anderson was the thorn for India yet again. The top order had no clue and struggled against some quality swing. The likes of Bresnan and Swann carried forward the good work, but some late hitting coupled with poor death bowling meant India could manage a brilliant recovery. No team has chased successfuly under lights at the Oval. Will it change today? Join us in a while to find out..3, 0 , 2 , 7: These were the scores India's top four managed. It was turning out to be a nightmare for India and its fans yet again, but MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja had other plans.

Jadeja cut loose after Dhoni fell and found good company in Ashwin as India, for once, made good use of the batting powerplay.4

He put on a good stand with MS and cut loose after he fell. Jadeja c Bell b Dernbach 78(89) [4s-10] Dernbach to Jadeja, THATS OUT!! Caught!!The pressure is showing on England.

INDIA:47.6 Anderson to Ashwin, FOUR!!, now it is Ashwin's turn! Ah, this is super stuff from the duo. This was in the slot, Ashwin backs away to leg and lofts it wide of mid off. Anderson is not known to be too good in the death and he has shown why!

Anderson points to Bresnan, asking him to use his brain!
INDIA:47.3  Anderson to Jadeja, FOUR!!, more poor stuff from Anderson and RJ makes most of it! Similar ball, similar shot, this time to the left of mid off. Excellent stuff this from Jadeja, not so good from Anderson
INDIA:47.2  Anderson to Jadeja, FOUR!!, there are so many men in the leg side boundary but Anderson bowls it outside off! Fullish and outside off, too easy for RJ who goes on his knees and lofts it over mid off, poor bowling, he isn't bowling to his fieldDeep mid wicket, long on and fine leg are the men in the deep.
INDIA:47.1  Anderson to Ashwin, 1 run, Ashwin backs away as Anderson follows him, Ashwin flicks and collects a single to fine legJames Anderson [8.0-1-32-3] is back into the attackEngland usually depend on Dernbach to bowl in the death, but that expensive over means Anderson will bowl now.

No slower ball this time - full and outside off, Jadeja stays in the crease and slaps it through the infield for a boundary. Nobody moved! Very expensive over from Dernbach
INDIA:45.5  Dernbach to Jadeja, FOUR!!, India are getting a move on at the right time! Dernbach does what he always does in the death overs - bowl the slower balls. But this time he bowls it wide down the leg, allowing RJ to free his arms and swing it through the on side, it falls just short of the deep square leg fence
INDIA:45.4  Dernbach to Ashwin, 3 runs, good batting again. But no boundary this time, he goes back and punches one through the off side, places it wide of cover but hasn't timed it well enough to reach the fence

INDIA:44.1  Bresnan to Dhoni, out Caught by Cook!! Batting powerplay strikes! Good ball that, Bresnan fires it in fast and very full on middle, Dhoni looks to get under it and loft it over the on side but it comes off the bottom part of the bat and lobs to mid off for a simple catch. Good contribution from the skipper, he did well when the team needed it badly. But now the question is: can India last the 50 overs? Dhoni c Cook b Bresnan 69(103) [4s-5] Bresnan to Dhoni, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Tim Bresnan [8.0-2-19-0] is back into the attackI am wondering why Dhoni can't ask for a runner.

It will be Karthik L to take you through till the next drinks break.

INDIA:12.5 Anderson to Raina, SIX!!, he tried that against Bresnan and failed miserably, but he has connected beautifully this time. That's Raina's pressure release shot. Clears his front leg and then sends the white ball miles back into the stands at deep mid wicket. The Indian supporters in the crowd have something to cheer about
INDIA:12.4  Anderson to Dhoni, 1 run, good thinking from Raina to call Dhoni through after Dhoni was in all sorts of trouble. The thick inside edge onto the pads nearly rolled back on to leg stump, but Raina called Dhoni through for the quick single. Anderson has a smile and some words to say to Dhoni

INDIA:11.5 Bresnan to Raina, no run, Raina is expecting the short ball and now tries to open the face and run it down to third man.

INDIA:11.3  Bresnan to Raina, no run, softly turned to short mid and then has to send Dhoni back, which he does

INDIA:10.2  Anderson to Kohli, out Caught by Kieswetter!! India are disintegrating and how! No need to play at those, but Kohli did and paid the price. The ploy of giving Anderson another over has paid off. Short of a length and seaming away, Kohli just had a tentative waft at it and the edge is taken by Kies to his right. The camera pans to a couple of Indian supporters who shake their head in disbelief. Kohli c Kieswetter b Anderson 7(18) Anderson to Kohli, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:10.1  Anderson to Kohli, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, defended from the creas

INDIA:9.5  Bresnan to Raina, no run, Raina just had a monumental brain freeze! What on earth was he doing there? Cleared his front leg and tried to hoick it over mid wicket, missed and the ball flew over the stumps. Even Bresnan can't believe it. The score is 23/3 and not 230/3. Sourav on air is understandably disappointed.
INDIA:9.4  Bresnan to Raina, FOUR!!, just wide of a diving Kieswetter. It was on the hips and Raina got inside the line and then deflected it to the right of Kies. First boundary for Raina and a lucky one too
INDIA:9.3  Bresnan to Raina, no run, keeps it full and wide outside off, Raina prefers to leave once more

INDIA:7.5  Bresnan to Kohli, no run, in the channel outside off, Kohli lets it go
INDIA:7.4  Bresnan to Kohli, no run, Kohli is in all sorts of trouble with the one coming back in towards his hips, this one pings him on the body
INDIA:7.3  Bresnan to Kohli, no run, another shout for LBW, but it was high an maybe going down leg. Kohli was caught on the crease and the sharp in-swinger caught him on the pads. Erasmus makes the right call though
INDIA:7.2  Bresnan to Kohli, no run, beautiful full delivery, just the little away movement to beat the bat. Kohli was shaping to cover drive and the late seam movement missed the bat
INDIA:7.1  Bresnan to Kohli, no run, gets right behind a straight delivery and defends
INDIA:6.6  Anderson to Raina, no run, Oooh! That is dangerous. Raina was lucky that the bounce on that saved him. He shouldered arms to a rising delivery on off stump and the bounce would have taken it over the stumps. But Raina cannot keep doing like that.
INDIA:6.5  Anderson to Raina, no run, full and on off stump, Raina gets a nice stride forward and defends
INDIA:6.5  Anderson to Raina, wide, Anderson tries the short one first up, but it is down leg and loops to the keeperSuresh Raina, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:6.4  Anderson to Patel, out Bowled!! Clatter! The stumps are re-arranged. It was full and seaming across Patel. Patel tried to whip that through leg and was nowhere near the line of the ball. The off stump is knocked down and a sorry sight for Patel who looks at the mess behind him and walks off. Completely lost the ball did Patel and played an over-ambitious shot. Anderson is on fire. Patel b Anderson 3(19) Anderson to Patel, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
INDIA:6.3  Anderson to Kohli, 1 run, Kohli plays away from the body and steers it with an open face wide of backward point
INDIA:6.2  Anderson to Kohli, 2 runs, now shuffles across and tucks a straight ball wide of square leg for a couple
INDIA:6.1  Anderson to Kohli, no run, too high as the appeal for LBW dies down. Kohli was caught on the shuffle and the ball hit him above the knee roll. Good call from the umpire Nigel Llong.
INDIA:5.6  Bresnan to Kohli, 1 run, lovely looking drive, Kohli plants his foot forward and eases a drive to the left of a sliding mid off
INDIA:5.5  Bresnan to Kohli, no run, Bresnan is giving nothing away, Kohli is assured in defence though
INDIA:5.4  Bresnan to Kohli, no run, stump to stump line, Kohli defends it from the crease
INDIA:5.3  Bresnan to Kohli, no run, short of length delivery outside off, rising too, left aloneVirat Kohli, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:5.2  Bresnan to Patel, out Dravid Run Out!! Desperation has resulted in a wicket for England. Patel was struggling to rotate the strike and in his eagerness to do so, has resulted in him running Dravid out. It was tapped close to mid off and he called Dravid for the single. Dravid was a bit slow to respond and Anderson coming in from mid off, hit direct. Dravid was caught short looking back at the ball. The third ump confirms the same. Dravid is disgusted and walks off flaying his bat at the turf. Dravid run out (Anderson) 2(11) Bresnan to Patel, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Is Dravid out? Looks like he is. OUT! Dravid is walking off. A waste of a wicket.
INDIA:5.1  Bresnan to Patel, no run, full and wide outside off, Patel mistimes the drive to mid off, Patel wanted to cover drive, but hit it too hard
INDIA:4.6  Anderson to Dravid, no run, a tidy backfoot defence to end the over
INDIA:4.5  Anderson to Dravid, no run, Ripper! How did that miss the off stump? Cut Dravid in half and the ball flew over the off stump. Dravid left a tiny gap between bat and pad and the in-swinger missed the off stump by a cat's whisker. Magnificent bowling.
INDIA:4.4  Anderson to Dravid, no run, a bit of friendly by-play from Anderson and Dravid. Dravid was looking for the quick single after dropping the ball near his feet. But Anderson was charging forward and prevented the single. He catches hold of Dravid and tries to prevent him from running. All in good humour though as Dravid smiles
INDIA:4.3  Anderson to Dravid, no run, soft hands of Dravid doing the trick. A definite edge, but Dravid dropped the bottom hand and the edge doesn't carry to Swann at 2nd slip
INDIA:4.2  Anderson to Dravid, leg byes, 2 runs, sliding down leg, Dravid tried to clip that fine, but it kissed the thigh pad and went down to fine leg for a couple of extras
INDIA:4.1  Anderson to Dravid, no run, back of a length and rising into Dravid's hips, who neatly keeps it down
INDIA:3.6  Bresnan to Patel, no run, not all that short. It was on a back of a length outside off, Patel went deep back in his crease and tried to manufacture a cut, but could only find point. Patel is trying to hit the ball too hard and that is not earning him the runs
INDIA:3.5  Bresnan to Dravid, 1 run, a carbon copy of the previous delivery. Once again its Anderson who is called into action at mid on, sliding to keep the nice looking flick down to a single
INDIA:3.4  Bresnan to Patel, 1 run, neat punch on the up, showing a full face of the bat, but Anderson went quickly to his right at mid off and kept it down to a single
INDIA:3.3  Bresnan to Patel, no run, full ball on off stump, Patel gets forward and defends near his feet, looks for the quick single, not there as the cover fielder charges in
INDIA:3.2  Bresnan to Patel, no run, and again, turns the straight ball to short mid wicket
INDIA:3.1  Bresnan to Patel, no run, tight stump to stump line from Bresnan and Patel defends it to mid wicket
INDIA:2.6  Anderson to Patel, 1 run, much better from Patel. Going deep back and then scything a steer with an open face down to Bresnan at third man who does well to keep it down to a single
INDIA:2.5  Anderson to Patel, no run, the pressure of the dot balls is getting to Patel. Tries to manufacture a pull shot to a not-so-short ball outside off, doesn't connect
INDIA:2.4  Anderson to Patel, no run, short of length and seaming away, on off stump, Patel defends with an open face
INDIA:2.3  Anderson to Patel, no run, Patel tried to hit that too hard and mistimed the cut straight to the fielder at backward point. Hit hard into the turf with no timing
INDIA:2.2  Anderson to Dravid, 1 run, Dravid gets deep back and nurdles a ball on the leg stump down to fine leg
INDIA:2.1  Anderson to Dravid, no run, Dravid has a wry smile on his face after that ball nearly squared him up. Dravid though didn't close the face too early and the soft leading edge dribbles away to cover. Anderson got a smile back from Dravid, who acknowledged that delivery
INDIA:1.6  Bresnan to Patel, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, Patel gets right behind the line and defends. End of a tight over from Bresnan
INDIA:1.5  Bresnan to Patel, no run, Patel went for the whiplash upper cut to a short and wide ball outside off and didn't make contact
INDIA:1.5  Bresnan to Patel, wide, down leg, easy call for Erasmus
INDIA:1.4  Bresnan to Patel, no run, lovely ball again, seaming away around off stump and drawing Patel forward, before missing the edge, Patel had a push at it and the ball whistled past the edge
INDIA:1.3  Bresnan to Patel, no run, a loud shout for LBW, but though it was pad first, it would've missed off stump, Patel jammed his bat and pad together as he tried to defend from the crease, Erasmus makes the right call
INDIA:1.2  Bresnan to Patel, no run, short and wide outside off, Patel again thought about a cut, then left it, expecting a wide from the umpire, but nothing given
INDIA:1.1  Bresnan to Patel, no run, in the corridor of uncertainty, Patel thought about a drive and then decided to let it goTim Bresnan, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:0.6  Anderson to Dravid, no run, beautiful carry through to Kieswetter, Dravid though is sure about his off stump and lets the ball go, it went flying into the keeper's mitts
INDIA:0.6  Anderson to Dravid, wide, down leg, a rare wayward delivery from Anderson
INDIA:0.5  Anderson to Dravid, no run, nearly another one! Dravid had a little fiddle at that seaming away swinger and flirted with danger. Dravid's waft missed the edge and went through to KieswetterRahul Dravid, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:0.4  Anderson to Rahane, out Caught by Trott!! First blood for Anderson and England. Lovely delivery that. Rahane had to play at that and the late movement takes the edge. It pitches on off stump and then seams away, Rahane was looking to defend from the crease, but it kissed the edge and landed in 1st slip's lap. Easily taken by Trott and India are in trouble straight-away. Rahane c Trott b Anderson 0(3) Anderson to Rahane, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:0.3  Anderson to Rahane, no run, nicely in behind it is Rahane, went deep back in his crease and blocks a short of length delivery outside off
INDIA:0.2  Anderson to Rahane, no run, short of length and seaming away, it pitches outside off and moves away, Rahane lets it go
INDIA:0.1  Anderson to Patel, 1 run, angling in towards middle stump line, Patel gets back and tucks it with the swing to long leg, to get off the markPatel and Rahane are at the crease. Patel is on strike. Anderson will open the attackA couple of slips in place for Anderson - who is playing in his 150th ODI. A nice little milestone for the man from Burnley.Will the move to pick Jadeja and RP backfire? Or will those decisions prove to be a master-stroke? Will India win a game on this wretched tour? The answers will be known shortly. The Indian openers walk out to the middle. The England team are in a huddle and break out of it after a pep talk by Cook. The conditions look ripe for swing and seam bowling. Anderson will have first use of the new nutTeams:India (Playing XI): Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Rahul Dravid, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, RP Singh, Munaf PatelEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Ben Stokes, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Jade DernbachMS Dhoni: The seamers will get some assistance at the start. Ravindra Jadeja comes into the side for Manoj Tiwary. RP Singh comes in for Vinay Kumar. Jadeja is a good left arm spinner and he gives us options. We have been struggling to find a seaming all-rounder and with few of the part-timers, it gives me a lot of options. It is a big positive for us that the batters are doing well.Cook: We will have a bowl first. There is a bit of live grass but it is hard to defend as the game progresses. Trott replaces Samit Patel. We have got all the basics covered and it gives another opportunity for Bopara. We will work hard for a victory.England have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report: Overcast conditions here at the Oval. There is plenty of patchy grass on this wicket. This is fresh grass and it is not the typical flat wicket. By the end of September, most of the pitches are used. The ball will seam because there is some humidity around. There is too much grass for an ODI pitch. Teams batting first have always won in day-night matches at the Oval. The ball will seam around for at least 30-35 overs. A score of 220-230 is a good score on this track.Hello and Welcome to the 3rd ODI between England and India at the Oval. England have played wonderful cricket throughout this summer and they will be looking to continue their dominance. India, on the other hand, will be desperate to register their first international win on this tour. The conditions are overcast at the moment but the chances of rain are slim.Preview by Saurabh SomaniIndia's familiar blues on tour continued with the seven-wicket defeat in the rain-shortened second ODI, which means a first international victory on tour has still eluded the former World Number One Test team and the current World Champions. The tour has, in fact, reached a point where the Indians can be thankful that even if they lost the previous match, at least they didn't lose any more players to injury.India can also take some heart from the fact that the previous ODI was more a T20 match for all practical purposes, and they perform much better over 50 overs than over 20 overs. Given that the forecast for tomorrow is only for partly cloudy skies, we may witness a full 50-overs match for the first time in the series.India: Even though they haven't won anything so far in the limited-overs leg of the series, the tourists have looked a lot more competitive than they were in the Test matches. The biggest gain for India has, almost paradoxically, been in the area they were supposed to feel the pinch of injuries the most: the openers. Without Tendulkar, Sehwag and Gambhir, the opening pair of Parthiv Patel and Ajinkya Rahane have performed superbly. Parthiv has rediscovered his batting talent, while the country has discovered Rahane. And in truth, Rahane has looked very much at home on the international stage. He is among the few men in domestic cricket who have been knocking fairly loudly on the doors of selection with mountains of runs, and his performance vindicates the faith people had in him. A full 50-over match will also suit Rahul Dravid more, instead of the hit-everything-in-sight 20-over one, where there is no time to build an innings. Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli too have shown signs of good form in the recent matches, which makes India's batting appear fairly robust. The problem, as always, is in the bowling. If India can fix that, they could still avoid a blank slate for the tour.England: England are walking on a bed of roses at the moment, and nothing they are doing is going wrong. And when it has gone marginally wrong - such as in the first ODI - rain has arrived, almost as if to wipe away the memories of any match not dominated in this series. In the Twenty20 match, England huffed and puffed to victory, aided a little by India losing the plot while batting. In the 23-over ODI, it seemed the bowlers had not done the job, but the batsmen made a stiff target look like a stroll in the park. Alastair Cook has been in the form of his life for the past few months. He's scored 382 runs off 381 balls at an average of 76.4 in his past 7 ODIs, and for a man whose career average and strike-rate are 40.00 and 78.33, those numbers show the kind of zone Cook has hit as a batsman. Craig Kieswetter, who might have been under mild pressure earlier, smashed 46 off 25 balls in the previous match, and though Jonathan Trott didn't play the 2nd ODI, his career average of an astounding 53.5 tells its own story. Even though England's bowling has not looked as threatening as it did with the red ball in Test matches, it has been leaps ahead of the Indian bowling, and has therefore managed to be adequate.Last Word: India need one of their batsmen to play an outstanding innings, with the others chipping in around him, because their best bet lies in winning the game with their batting. If England can prevent the Indian batsmen from batting on, even reasonable knocks from the tourists will most likely not be enough to secure a first win.TeamsIndia (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Rahul Dravid, Suresh Raina, Amit Mishra, Munaf Patel, Praveen Kumar, Subramaniam Badrinath, RP Singh, Virat Kohli, Parthiv Patel, Vinay Kumar, Ravichandran Ashwin, Varun Aaron, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravindra Jadeja, Manoj TiwaryEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Ravi Bopara, Steven Finn, Jade Dernbach, Samit Patel, Ben Stokes, Craig Kieswetter(w)LATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
