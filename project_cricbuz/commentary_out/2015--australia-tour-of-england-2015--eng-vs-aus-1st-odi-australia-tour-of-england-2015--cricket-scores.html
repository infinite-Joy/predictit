Nothing but a short of length delivery down the leg-side, Woakes swivels and tries to pull it fine, gets the glove on it, Wade takes the catch and goes up immediately, umpire Michael Gough had no doubt in his mind. Woakes didn't even think about the review as he knew he gloved that. Woakes c Wade b Coulter-Nile 0(1)Coulter-Nile to Woakes, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Chris Woakes, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:36.1 Coulter-Nile to Buttler, out Caught by Mitchell Marsh!! In the airrr and that's a good grab by Mitch Marsh. The World Champions are doing it nicely here. They put pressure on England and have now got two big wickets in the space of 3 balls. I must say that Buttler was never moving his feet in his stay at the crease, probably had he moved forward to this one, he would have been able to control the shot, instead plays the drive with laden feet and the full ball goes to the left of mid-off. Marsh moves to his left and reverse-cups it, ensures that it doesn't pop out even as he tumbles onto the ground. Buttler c Mitchell Marsh b Coulter-Nile 4(10)Coulter-Nile to Buttler, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

After a sensational opening stand, Australia have managed to pull things back. The required run rate was well under control but it's now shot past 7.50. The key for England though is that Morgan is still at the crease and if Buttler can stay around for a while, things will change quickly. There is still a lot of batting to come, with the likes of Moeen, Rashid and Woakes to follow. Don't take your eyes off this folks, we are heading towards an exciting finish!

Wade signalled for a review, he didn't even consult the skipper. Replays clearly indicated that Stokes missed it by a long wayAustralia have taken a review, for a caught behind against Stokes. Wade the man who went up straightaway, didn't even consult Smith. Fair delivery from Maxwell, looks like Stokes hasn't got any bat on that, nothing on the HotSpot, Dharmasena "can clearly see daylight between the bat and the ball" - as he says.

ENGLAND:26.2 Watson to James Taylor, out Bowled!! Well, almost a carbon copy of the last delivery. However, the only difference this time around is Taylor doesn't get anything on it as he charges the bowler, misses and his middle-stump gets shattered. Watson just kept it simple by looking to target the stumps, he got a bit of shape back into Taylor as well. Watson certainly knows that Taylor has the habit of moving around the crease. This time around, he won the battle. Perseverance has done the trick for the bowler. James Taylor b Watson 49(51) [4s-4 6s-1]Watson to James Taylor, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Jason Roy is on strike. Starc will open the attackStarc will start the proceedings with two slips in place.Hello and welcome back for the second innings. Riding on the back of Matthew Wade's quick-fire fifty, the tourists posted a substantial total. However, the track is flat and the hosts will fancy their chances of chasing it down.Adil Rashid was the chief wicket-taker for the home team and took four scalps. Rashid's variations certainly troubled the opposition ranks. He was also a trifle lucky in the sense that he picked up wickets through a couple of full tosses. It has to be said that barring Rashid and Moeen Ali, who was economical, rest of the English bowlers struggled a bit. The deck is flat and we could be in for an exciting contest, as the hosts look to overhaul the sizeable target.Despite losing their way in the middle overs, Australia ended up with a very good total on the board. David Warner, Joe Burns and Steven Smith all looked in fine touch, but just couldn't covert it into big scores. To make it worse for the tourists, on the back of a terrible mix-up with Matthew Wade, Shane Watson was run-out. However, Wade and Mitchell Marsh cracked a volley of fine strokes, and strung together a key stand for the seventh wicket to lift their spirits. Wade also composed an enterprising fifty.Australia scored 93 runs in the last 10 overs, but they would have got a lot more had Marsh not struggled for timing. Smith stands and applauds from the balcony. It has to be said that England executed the yorker very well at the death. Probably Australia are 15-20 runs short of a par score on this belter of a pitch.4

This is a lucky wicket for Wood. Certainly not a wicket-taking delivery but he's got the big wicket of Maxwell. This could make a difference of at least 15-20 runs to the final score.

Finn will open the attackThe players are making their way out to the middle. We are all set for the actions to begin. Joe Burns walks out with David Warner. Steve Finn to open the attack with two slips.Teams:England (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Steven FinnAustralia (Playing XI): David Warner, Joe Burns, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Shane Watson, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat CumminsMorgan: "We probably would have batted first as well, but we don't mind. It (the pitch) looks an absolute belter, hopefully we'll restrict them to a chasable score. Moeen will bat at No. 7, James Taylor comes in for Joe Root. I think we might see a lot of slower bowlers bowling in the last 10 overs because of the new regulations."Smith: "We are going to bat. It looks a pretty good wicket, little bit dry, they are playing two spinners, so get them out of the game early and hopefully post a good first innings score. We are very confident of the way we are playing in one-day cricket, hopefully we can put on a good show here today. Same team as we played in Ireland."Australia have won the toss and have opted to batToss time folks!So, we are up for a nail-biting ODI series then. Update on toss and teams in a little while. Stay tuned my dear friends.....We've already witnessed glimpses of what is going to happen during the only T20I where England pulled off an enthralling win by making a brilliant comeback in the last 15 balls. Despite Steven Smith's outstanding (53-ball 90) knock, the lower middle-order foul-up meant Australia fell short by 5 runs whilst chasing 183.Australia will be playing their second ODI since their World Cup triumph with responsibility heavily reliant on their new skipper. The World Champions would love to emulate what they did to England on the inaugural day of the World Cup. England have won the Ashes, they've won the only T20I, if they manage to win the ODI series, that would be the first time ever England have won a complete series (across all formats) on home soil in many years.Alrighty folks! It's simple - England have started to play the Australian way. Many cricket purists rated the England - New Zealand ODI series as the "most thrilling (ODI) series in history." Thanks to Brendon McCullum and his team for making it contagious (if you know what I meant) all around. It has certainly set new ODI standards.Clobbered most number of boundaries (by a team) in a 5-match ODI series (209 boundaries).Posted the highest total by a team in a 5-match ODI series (1617 runs).Produced the highest aggregate ODI score in England and third highest overall (NZ - 398/5, ENG 365/9).Secured their highest ever successful run-chase (350/3) in ODIs.First time in the history of ODI cricket, England succeeded in posting 300 plus scores in three consecutive games.Recorded their biggest win in ODIs (in terms of runs - 210).England registered their highest ever ODI score. (408/9).Just a couple of months earlier, when New Zealand toured England, the home team played their best ever ODI cricket. Don't you believe me? well then! here you go..Greetings everyone! It's a start of a new era for the Australian cricket team, in fact, the Steven Smith era. if you're not quite following England's ODI cricket since their dismal show at the World Cup, here are a few bizarre stats which will herald the transformation of a tedious-England into an all-aggressive approach-England.Preview:World Champions Australia will embark on a new era under Steven Smith with the hope of redeeming themselves after their meek surrender of the Urn and the defeat in the one-off T20I against England. Their high-flying opposition, on the other hand, will have their tasks cut out when they host the World Cup 2015 winners in the first of the five-match series at the Rose Bowl in Southampton on Thursday. The last time these two teams met in an ODI in a group stage fixture of the World Cup 2015, the Aussies dominated proceedings from start to finish in a 111-run annihilation of Eoin Morgan's team. However, the insipid English side has undergone an exciting transformation under new coach Trevor Bayliss. With the all-important Ashes trophy placed firmly in their bags, Morgan's men will be eager to ruffle a few more feathers in the Aussie camp. With new field restriction rules kicking in, it will be interesting to see how it impacts the approach of both these sides.Date: 3rd September, 2015Time: 18.30 PM 
AUSTRALIA:18.30 PM IST Venue: The Rose Bowl, SouthamptonWeather conditions: CloudyAustralia: World Champions Australia will view the limited-overs series as the best opportunity to fill the wounds suffered during their Ashes 2015 defeat and walk into the Smith era with a blank slate. Australia will be without opener Aaron Finch, who smashed 135 against England in the World Cup, but the 25-year-old Joe Burns has proven his potential of filling the void successfully, with solid performances for the A side. Shane Watson too has the chance to get over the poor form he endured with the bat during the Ashes and the unlucky dismissal in the one-off T20I, to strengthen the Aussie middle-order. Among the bowlers, this series could provide Nathan Coulter-Nile the chance to enhance his credentials as a worthy first-change pacer as Mitchell Johnson cools his heels on the sidelines. With three wickets in the one-off ODI against Ireland, Coulter-Nile comes into the game with a bit of confidence. A lot of focus will also be on the young and nippy Pat Cummins while the star of the World Cup Mitchell Starc will lead the attack with the ball. Stumper Matthew Wade has had a checkered career, characterized by injures and fluctuating form. With Brad Haddin's retirement, the Tasmania-born 27-year-old has the chance to establish himself as first-choice for a long time to come.Probable XI: Joe Burns, David Warner, Steven Smith, George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Shane Watson, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat CumminsEngland:After leading England to an Ashes triumph (460 runs in nine innings), Joe Root has been given the luxury of taking a break from the limited-overs series while Moeen Ali returns to the fold in the dual role of a top-order batsman and a handy spinner. The middle-order triumvirate of Moeen, Eoin Morgan and Ben Stokes form the fulcrum of England's batting unit with Jos Buttler and Sam Billings coming in as wicket-keeping options. Steven Finn and Mark Wood are expected to play as the two front line pacers, with left-arm medium pacer David Willey operating in the middle-overs alongside leg-break bowler Adil Rashid.Probable XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan (c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Sam Billings, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Steven Finn.Quote:"I reckon we can probably bowl a lot more bouncers than we did in that Twenty20 game." - Australian pacer Mitchell Starc on the ploy to stop Moeen Ali.Teams:Australia (From): David Warner, Joe Burns, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), Nathan Coulter-Nile, Ashton Agar, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Shane Watson, James Pattinson, Marcus StoinisEngland (From): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Sam Billings, David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Steven Finn, Mark Wood, Chris Woakes, James TaylorLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
