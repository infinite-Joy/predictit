Hello and welcome to the fourth ODI being played at Dhaka. Both teams will observe a minute's silence prior to the start of the match and also wear black armbands as a mark of respect for Phillip Hughes, who passed away yesterday. We will bring you the toss and teams shortly. Stay tuned...With the series already in the bag, Bangladesh will be targetting to extend their lead and eventually whitewash the struggling Zimbabweans. They have performed well as a team throughout the series, with spinners playing a major role in all their victories. It is a good chance for them to expose new talent and make use of the opportunities to remain at the top. On the other hand, the visitors find themselves in a rut. They have put in Bangladesh to bat first in all the three games so far but have been unable to restrict them below 250. Their bowlers have not been able to contain runs in the death overs, while their batsmen have succumbed against a quality spin attack.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Hamilton Masakadza, Vusi Sibanda, Timycen Maruma, Brendan Taylor, Solomon Mire, Regis Chakabva, Elton Chigumbura(c), Peter Moor(w), Neville Madziva, Tinashe Panyangara, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Sikandar Raza, Tendai Chatara, Natsai Mushangwe, John Nyumbu, Tawanda Mupariwa, Craig Ervine, Richmond Mutumbami, Malcolm Waller, Brian Vitori, Shingirai MasakadzaBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Mominul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Mahmudullah, Sabbir Rahman, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Arafat Sunny, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Jubair Hossain, Al-Amin Hossain, Imrul KayesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
