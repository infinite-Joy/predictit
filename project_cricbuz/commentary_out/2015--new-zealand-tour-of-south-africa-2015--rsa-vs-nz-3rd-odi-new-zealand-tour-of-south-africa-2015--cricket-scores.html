Guptill is on strike. Steyn will open the attackWelcome back.. Three slips in place as Steyn steams in.Two quick wickets fell as Amla was caught and bowled by Elliott, who found appreciable swing and seam movement to trouble the batsmen throughout, and Wheeler nicked out another left-hander in Rossouw. de Villiers looked edgy early on but got into his groove as he drove and pulled to 8000 ODI runs and eventually to a breezy ODI fifty, his 47th overall. He was bowled by one from Bracewell that nipped back in to beat his defenses. Miller provided good support at the other end before edging pacy Milne behind to the keeper. Some good shots and a positive intent from Behardien took South Africa to what can be considered a competitive total on this Durban pitch. Join us in about 30 minutes in what should be a delicious chase in a decider..New Zealand were a combination of sloppy and genius in the field as they dropped as many as four catches but stopped a few boundaries throwing themselves around. Earlier, opting to bat first, Amla and van Wyk brought up their first 50+ stand in the series. An early dolly drop of van Wyk at fine leg by Bracewell definitely helped on a pitch that was anti-Potchefstroom to say the least. Morne van Wyk pounced on the opportunity and registered his 4th ODI fifty which was steady but far from comfortable. Amla was sublime at the other end as he rotated the strike with ease.4

Just one slip in place..So, two changes for South Africa. Kyle Abbott comes in place of Vernon Philander. Kagiso Rabada replaces Aaron Phangiso. New Zealand have named an unchanged playing eleven.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), George Worker, Grant Elliott, Colin Munro, Luke Ronchi(w), Adam Milne, Doug Bracewell, Ish Sodhi, Ben WheelerSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Morne van Wyk(w), Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, David Wiese, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Kyle AbbottSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to batHello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the final ODI between South Africa and New Zealand. We are at Durban for the decider. The series is well poised at the moment. South Africa were off to a winning start at Centurion, but the visitors pulled things back at Potchefstroom. It has a been quite a low key series with both teams having been forced to field weaker teams. As expected South Africa's pre-season form has been patchy. AB de Villiers' men haven't looked at their sharp best as yet - the pitches have been on the slower side as well - suiting New Zealand's battery of seam-up bowlers and spinners. Will Kingsmead be any different? Toss and teams in a while..PreviewThe South Africa-New Zealand ODI series stands at an interesting juncture, level at 1-1. The competition fought for attention because of the Ashes and the Sri Lanka-India Test series, which stole the limelight due to the retirements of Michael Clarke and Kumar Sangakkara. The focus will now shift to the deciding encounter. Both teams have had their fair share of problems and successes. With the way things have gone in the series so far, it could be a close contest.South Africa's batting unit has been good in one match and poor in the other. Morne van Wyk has failed in the opening role and David Wiese in the middle-order has not been able to contribute much. They can, however, be happy with the form Rilee Rossouw is in. One of the major challenges that South Africa has faced in the series so far is their shoddy fielding. A flurry of dropped catches have only hurt their reputation and they will be keen to make amends.The Black Caps' strength is their batting order, which has performed consistently, although wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi has not been all that impressive with the bat. Ronchi has done a fairly decent job behind the stumps and he will be keen to get amongst the runs. New Zealand were also below par in their fielding in the first game, but they rectified that mistake in the second, edging ahead of South Africa on that front.Match Date: August 26, 2015Start Time: 12:30 Local time (10:30 GMT, 16:00 IST)Venue: Kingsmead, DurbanWeather: Cloudy and humid with a maximum high of 26 degree CelsiusTeam News:South Africa:Kyle Abbott is the only South African bowler, who has not got a chance to play in the series. Kingsmead is his home-ground and the hosts are likely to add him to the side for the third game. It will also be interesting to see whether they opt to include Dean Elgar, who could be a useful addition to the team, although he has not played an ODI since late 2012.Probable XI: Morne van Wyk (wk), Hashim Amla, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers (c), David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, David Wiese/Dean Elgar, Vernon Philander, Kyle Abbott, Dale Steyn, Imran TahirNew Zealand:James Neesham had scored a solid 41 in the first ODI, but was dropped from the side in the second as New Zealand tweaked their team. The Black Caps might bring him back for the third game as he also gives them a decent bowling option. Mitchell McClenaghan was replaced by Ben Wheeler in the second ODI, after the former proved to be very expensive. However, since Wheeler failed to do anything of note in the second match, McClenaghan might return.Probable XI: Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson (c), George Worker, Grant Elliott, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi (wk), Nathan McCullum, Doug Bracewell, Ben Wheeler/Mitchell McClenaghan, Adam MilneStats and Trivia:If South Africa win the series, they will overtake New Zealand and go to the third spot in the ICC ODI rankings.South Africa have never lost two successive bilateral ODI series since 2009-10. They had lost the ODI series against Bangladesh 2-1 last month.Quote:"We're coming on in leaps and bounds.
