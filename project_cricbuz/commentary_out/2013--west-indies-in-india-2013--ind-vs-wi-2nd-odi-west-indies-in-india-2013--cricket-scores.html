He forged two crucial stands with Laxman and then with Ganguly which helped India to make 441 in the first innings. He handled the debutant spinner Jason Krejza - who took 8 wickets quite well and negated his growing threat. India reclaimed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy with a convincing 172-run win and gave Ganguly a fitting farewell.

Having come into the game with a chance of squaring the series after a historic win at Perth in the previous Test, India were presented with a typical subcontinental pitch which offered nothing for the bowlers. Still they slipped to 156/4 and from then on Tendulkar took control along with a trusted ally in Laxman. Once again it was a case of shifting gears once he had taken his time to get to a 50. Tendulkar took a particular liking to Bradley Hogg whom he treated with contempt. Out came those lofted hits and those powerful sweeps, he was unafraid of using his feet and got to his ton in a hurry. It was the second hundred of the series for Tendulkar, but on a pitch that never looked like producing a result, the match petered out to a draw.

Result: Australia won by 122 runs. India vs Australia time again and a Test match at Sydney again which means only one thing the inevitable Sachin Tendulkar hundred. He had made hundreds at Sydney in two of his past three visits in 91-92 and 03-04 missing out in 99-00. Another splendid knock which gave India a vital 69-run lead but this match will be remembered for all the wrong reasons highly dubious umpiring and for the infamous Monkey Gate scandal. But nothing should take away from Sachin's glorious knock, if he had battled all the odds in his previous visit here in 2004 to make a double-ton, this unbeaten 154 was more of a turning the clock back, kind of innings. There were the sublime drives, the authentic back foot punches, the intentional upper-cuts and the trademark whips to the on-side which brought back vintage memories. Sadly though, all that brilliance was overshadowed and largely forgotten by the disgraceful and unwanted episodes the Test and the events that took place thereafter, which dominated everyone's minds.

A record-breaking ton and a very poignant one too as Sachin went past Sunil Gavaskar's tally of 34 Test tons to take his place at the top of the summit amongst leading century-makers in the longest format of the game. The first half of the hundred was a patient one, with Tendulkar taking his time to assess the conditions and then slowly building an innings. The second one was more flashy and he opened out. The moment finally came at 4:45pm in fading light as he turned Vaas to fine leg for a single. Tendulkar admitted it was an emotional moment and added: "The wait was more for the people than for me.17:20 IST: A decent effort in the end from India. They looked good for more when Kohli was going all guns blazing. He looked set to create history by scoring three consective tons on this ground, it was not to be though as Rampaul sent him packing for 99. Rohit Sharma fell early and Dhawan promised more than just 35. Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina disappointed yet again, and it was left to skipper MS Dhoni to lift India to a challenging score. 'Captain Cool' did his job and India will be pretty happy with their final tally. Ravi Rampaul was the best bowler on display, although his figures were damaged right at the end.

Result: India won by an innings and 140 runs. Tendulkar's highest Test score till date and also a very significant one for it enabled him to draw level with his idol, Sunil Gavaskar in the all-time list for most hundreds in Tests. The innings was special because Tendulkar had been battling a tennis elbow for at least four months before the match and he was helped by a generous Bangladesh side who dropped him thrice before he reached 50. The knock lasted 379 balls and took nine hours and 12 minutes. When he reached 100, he joined an elite club of Gary Kirsten and Steve Waugh as the only men to have scored Test centuries against all countries. As the innings progressed, the Tendulkar of old resurfaced and that proved to be the death knell for an average Bangladeshi side.

Result: India won by an innings and 52 runs. This match will be most remembered for the surprise declaration that Rahul Dravid the then acting captain came up when Sachin was on 194 rather than for the exploits of the Indian team. Virender Sehwag became the first Indian to score a triple-century and Sachin contributed a big hundred of his own. On a slow and placid Multan track, the duo feasted on the Pakistani bowlers adding 326 for the third wicket. When it was time for a move on, Tendulkar batted a little too slowly for Dravid's liking to get to his 200 and the latter declared. Tendulkar didn't take the field that evening and later in the press conference expressed his surprise and disappointment at the decision to declare. But the decision to declare had no impact on the game as Pakistan folded just 12 balls into the final day to hand India an innings win. To clear any lingering mistrust over his decision, Dravid called Tendulkar aside for a one-on-one and everything was sorted which showed a rare understanding of the situation and also demonstrated a facet of the new Team India which wouldn't have been possible in the faction-ridden teams of the past.

It was sort of a mini-crisis for Sachin going into the Sydney Test of 2004 he hadn't got a Test ton in 7 matches and was going through a slump which saw him getting out repeatedly edging the ball outside the off stump. So in order to put an end to that, Sachin produced a remarkable knock of an unbeaten 241 his highest Test score then which didn't include a single cover drive. He had completely eliminated that shot from his armor and gave the bowlers no chance, playing balls from outside off through the on-side. He was outscored by Laxman during their stand, but he was never bothered. He showed great restraint and played at balls only when he had to. It was an innings that stood out for the sheer determination and the will to make runs at all costs attitude of Sachin. He stole the thunder from Steve Waugh's final Test in front of an adoring home crowd which had come to see their favorite son, but instead saw yet another Sachin hundred. Later when asked why he had decided to abandon the cover drive, he had this to say: "I had got out a couple of times to balls bowled outside the off stump," he said, "so I decided not to play that stroke (the cover-drive). They were bowling consistently outside the off stump, and I decided to leave all those balls. Then they had to bowl to me and I used the pace of the ball.

He was neither too aggressive nor too defensive but still got the job done and silenced his critics who often criticized him for not coming up with the goods when the team needed it the most. Together with Laxman, Tendulkar saved India from what would have been an embarrassing loss at home against a decent West Indian side.

Result: India won by an innings and 46 runs. The conditions were dark, dank and gloomy. The pitch was a haven for fast bowlers. The experts were crying for the captain who wins the toss to bowl first, in order to exploit the conditions. The venue was Headingley where historically teams have fielded first. India had a poor record when confronted with seaming conditions early on and more importantly they were 0-1 down coming into the game. So with everything pointing only one way, what does the skipper do? Win the toss and then make the brave call of batting first. It turned out to be a masterstroke as India made 628 with Tendulkar top-scoring with 193. He was severe on the English bowlers and one particular shot stands out for the sheer distance it travelled charging Andy Caddick and then depositing him way back into the deep midwicket stands. It was thrilling batting and one that the crowds thoroughly enjoyed. It set India on their way to an innings win and Ganguly's decision was vindicated. The Leeds win of 2002 marked the birth of a new Team India which knew how to win under all conditions and against all opposition even when the odds were heavily stacked against them.

INDIA:1.6 J Holder to Rohit, no run, again on a length outside off, Sharma covers his stumps and lets it go alone. The line from Holder was too far outside off and Rohit didn't play a single ball with his bat

INDIA:1.1 J Holder to Dhawan, 1 run, low full toss on off, Dhawan gets forward and pushes it straight down the ground, Holder does not stop it as they scamper for a single, Permaul at mid-off runs in and shies at the bowlers end but does not hit the stumps, that would have been out if he had hit, Permaul had all three stumps to aim at. We can certainly say that was a chance missed.Jason Holder, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:0.6  Rampaul to Rohit, no run, short of length on off, Sharma trusts the bounce and lets it go alone, a very good leave from the in-form batsman
INDIA:0.5  Rampaul to Rohit, FOUR, on a length around off, it holds its line, Sharma stays back and tries to defend but gets an outside edge that goes between slip and gully for the second boundary of the over. Rampaul does not look pleased with that

INDIA:0.3  Rampaul to Rohit, no run, short and shaping away outside off, Sharma shoulders arms to that as he lets it go through
INDIA:0.2  Rampaul to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit gets off the mark in style. This was not a bad delivery at all, it was back of a length just outside off, Sharma rocks back and punches it beautifully to the sweeper cover fence. The ball races away on this fast outfield
INDIA:0.1  Rampaul to Rohit, no run, starts with a short of length ball around off, Sharma goes back and pushes it gently towards coverRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike.

Here we go with the first ball....Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Mohit SharmaWest Indies (Playing XI): Johnson Charles(w), Kieran Powell, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo(c), Darren Sammy, Sunil Narine, Jason Holder, Ravi Rampaul, Veerasammy PermaulDhoni: "We were looking to chase. Since we have done well doing that. It looks like a good wicket and it might be true throughout. We didn't expect to get a game with all the storms and with what happened in Baramati. But it did not rain yesterday so I don't think it will rain today. Mohit Sharma replaces Unadkat."Bravo: "We will bowl first. The pitch has been covered for a while, so we will give our bowlers an opportunity to have a crack first. It is a must win game for us and we will look to play some positive cricket. Gayle is out and he is flying back home tomorrow. Powell comes in and Permaul replaces Deonarine."West Indies have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: "The outfield is dry with a bit of moisture in it from the rain yesterday. There are not a lot of cracks on the pitch. It is a well-rolled wicket. Rain is expected later in the evening and that might make a difference. Experts reckon that it will be better to bat first and put some runs on board as D/L method may affect the team that chases."The first ODI was just a mere formality as far as the Indian batsmen were concerned. Used to chasing 350 plus they were set a mere 212 which was too easy for them. They were in a hurry to chase it down and the in-form men Rohit and Kohli made sure that it was done that way. West Indian batsmen were strangled by the spinners as they picked up 8 wickets between them. They must find a way to counter the spin threat otherwise they are on their way for a whitewash.There was rain predicted but it is bright and sunny and a perfect day for some good cricket. But will we get to see good cricket, with the way West Indians have been playing? Hello and welcome to the second ODI in Vizag. India are currently on a roll and it will take some spectacular cricket from the men from Caribbean to stop this streak. The team might remain the same, unless Mohit Sharma comes in for Unadkat. As for West Indies, they are without the big man Gayle who is ruled out of the series. Coach Gibson has said it is a good opportunity for the others to step-up. Will they do so? We will have to wait and watch. Team compostion and toss in a short while, stay tuned.....The Preview, by Nikhil Narain.If Charles Dickens were to write a review of the contest between India and West Indies, he would probably give it the title, 'A Tale of two countries'! Come Sunday, the 24th of November and West Indies would have been on tour for 24 days. 24 days without a win and more importantly 24 days of projecting themselves as nothing more than a high-profile club team! Massive innings defeats in Kolkata and Mumbai in the Test series followed by a six-wicket hammering in the ODI opener in Kochi has raised a plethora of questions and left an umpteen number of doubts on the credibility and motivation of the incumbent West Indian bunch.Visakhapatnam would provide the visitors one last opportunity to redeem themselves and reclaim some of their lost pride. On the other hand, India are basking in the glory of their young and talented batting line-up which is scaling and setting new heights and creating unparalleled waves with every step they take. Sitting pretty at the top of the ICC ODI rankings, India would look to continue their domination and seal the three-match series in the south-eastern port city of Andhra Pradesh.IndiaIndia's young batting brigade has set the cricketing world on fire with consistently brilliant performances, especially in one-day international cricket. Openers, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan have put together 1240 runs in 21 innings at a stunning average of 62 including six century partnerships. Virat Kohli's meteorical rise has been synonymous with India's domination in the format. The man of the match in the first ODI aggregates 1119 runs in 2013 at 55.95 per dismissal coupled with a strike rate of 97.98.Yuvraj Singh's indifferent form would be the only concern for India in the batting department. He had a decent look in in the first ODI and India would hope that the flamboyant southpaw regains his lost touch. Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja provide a strong middle and lower order.The spinners led by Jadeja and Raina and well supported by R Ashwin had tormented the West Indian batsmen on a two-paced wicket at Kochi. With Visakhapatnam expected to be an absolute belter, it would be interesting to see if the trio taste the same success. Mohammad Shami has been impressive since his debut 9-wicket haul in Kolkata. Mohit Sharma might come in for Jaydev Unadkat after the latter's lacklustre performance in Kochi.West IndiesIt has been a sorry tale for the team from the Caribbean since the day they stepped ashore on Indian territory. The batting has been the huge disappointment with none of their batsmen showing the will and application to spend some time at the crease. With news coming in that Chris Gayle will sit out of the remaining two matches with a hamstring injury, the gloom just gets greyer for the visitors.The frustrating thing for West Indies has been the fact that most of their batsmen got a start in Kochi but failed to convert that into any score of substantial value. Johnson Charles looked in good touch during his knock of 42 while Darren Bravo registered a fighting fifty. The tourists need the likes of Marlon Samuels and Lendl Simmons to assume more responsibility in the middle order. Skipper, Dwayne Bravo and Darren Sammy are dangerous batsmen coming down the order well capable of clearing any field but need a bit some stability from the top-order to showcase their prowess.Jason Holder and Ravi Rampaul extracted some pace and bounce from the Kochi wicket. They bowled with heart and zest and that should augur well for the West Indies team. Sunil Narine needs to live up to his reputation of being one of the finest and most miserly bowlers in limited overs cricket. Sammy and Bravo could prove to be useful in the middle overs. The latter has a lot of variety with his change of pace and has the knack of breaking partnerships and picking up crucial wickets.Pitch and Weather ConditionsThe 22 yards at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy stadium would make the batsmen's tongue leap out. A run feast can be expected on the flat deck in Visakhapatnam. Cyclone 'Helen' is creating havoc on the south-eastern Indian coast and there are chances of rain interruptions for the encounter.Stats Trivia- Shikhar Dhawan is just four short of completing 1000 ODI runs in 2013. He will be the sixth batsmen overall and the third Indian after Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli should he achieve this feat.- Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma aggregate 1576 ODI partnership runs in 29 innings at a remarkable average of 58.37.- Rohit Sharma with 1143 runs from 23 ODI innings is the leading run-scorer in the format in 2013.- Ravindra Jadeja with 49 wickets is the leading wicket-taker in ODI cricket in 2013.- Darren Bravo with 673 runs from 21 innings is the leading run-scorer for West Indies in 2013.Quotes:He is our best batsman in this format. He is one of the senior players in the team and one of the players that know Indian conditions quite well. But I will always try to look at the positive and it gives an opportunity for somebody else to make a name for himself - West Indies coach, Ottis Gibson on Chris Gayle's absence.Teams:West Indies (From): Johnson Charles(w), Lendl Simmons, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Narsingh Deonarine, Dwayne Bravo(c), Darren Sammy, Sunil Narine, Jason Holder, Ravi Rampaul, Tino Best, Kieran Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Veerasammy PermaulIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaydev Unadkat, Mohammed Shami, Amit Mishra, Ambati Rayudu, Mohit Sharma, Vinay KumarLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
