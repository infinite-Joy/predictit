Some things never change, do they?Right, after the end of the anthems, the action is all set to start. Cook and Bell are all set to take strike. Nuwan Kulasekara is all set to open the bowling. Now, this is one bowler who can really exploit the conditions well here.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kushal Janith Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Shaminda Eranga, Lasith MalingaEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Graeme Swann, Tim Bresnan, James Anderson, Stuart BroadCook: "We have to put behind the off-field issues and concentrate on the cricket today. Graeme Swann replaces James Tredwell. Malinga is an outstanding ODI bowler but we have played against him before. We played well in the first game and if we win, we are through to the semi-finals."Mathews: "It is not ideal conditions but we have to adjust quickly. I am enjoying the captaincy. We are going to bowl first. We are playing three seamers. Nuwan Kulasekara replaces Thisara Perera. He should bowl well under these conditions. The England team are used to the conditions and we have to bat well. Malinga is a key weapon and we have to use him sensibly."Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to fieldIn the previous encounter between these two teams at the Oval in 2011, it was a rain-curtailed affair and the match was reduced to 32 overs. James Anderson was the chief destroyer with four wickets as England won by 110 runs. It was also the final match for the Sri Lankan legend, Sanath Jayasuriya. How time flies!A loss for Sri Lanka means that they will be out of the tournament. However, if they win, then the whole group remains open with all four teams in with a chance of qualifying.Hello and welcome to another day in the Champions Trophy. The game today is between hosts England and Sri Lanka. While England won their first game against Austalia, Sri Lanka lost a closely fought thriller to New Zealand. With yesterday's game between the trans-Tasman rivals getting washed out, this game assumes significance for Sri Lanka as they are the only team in the group to be on 0 points. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates.PreviewSri Lanka will look for a vastly improved batting performance against hosts England on Thursday as they try to stay afloat in the Champions Trophy.Angelo Mathews' team were shot out for 138 against New Zealand in Cardiff on Sunday, and only a hostile four-wicket spell from sling-arm fast bowler Lasith Malinga helped them save face in the narrow one-wicket defeat.Sri Lanka, World Cup finalists in 2007 and 2011, must now defeat both England and Australia in day-night matches at the Oval to keep their semi-final hopes alive from group A."I think the whole batting unit has to take responsibility," Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews said on Wednesday. "We can't really expect the bowlers to do the job for us everytime."Mathews said the morale was high despite the opening setback and added he expected his team to come back strongly in the next two matches."Defending 138, the guys responded to that brilliantly," he said. "The equation is simple. We have got two games and we have to win both to stay alive in the tournament."We have to stay positive and take England on. We should not put too much pressure on ourselves. We have to go out there, enjoy the game and do the best we can. The result will take care of itself."Mathews said England had one of the best seam attacks in the game and admitted the first task for his team was to play out the full 50 overs.Sri Lanka lasted just 37.5 overs against New Zealand, mainly due to Kumar Sangakkara's defiant 68 as seven batsmen failed to reach double figures on a slow Cardiff pitch.England, meanwhile, bounced back from a 2-1 one-day series loss against New Zealand ahead of the tournament to brush aside old foes Australia by 48 runs in their first match.Alastair Cook's home team go into the match with their preparations overshadowed by an incident at a bar in Birmingham between Australia's David Warner and young England player Joe Root over the weekend.Australia stood down Warner for Wednesday's match against New Zealand for what the England and Wales Cricket Board said was an "unprovoked physical attack on a member of the England team."Cook, who confirmed that the England player involved was 22-year-old Root, insisted the team wanted to get over the incident to concentrate on what was an important game for the hosts."We are clearly disappointed that the incident happened, but after investigating it from our side, we don't believe we have done anything wrong," said Cook."Joe just wants to get the matter buried and play cricket. He's an excellent young man. It's unfortunate this has happened, but he wants to put it behind him."Cook said Malinga would be the danger man for his side, mainly because of his unusual bowling action."Malinga is a mighty fine bowler," the England captain said. "He has got a very different technique and bowling action. Some of the lads have faced him before."So if we can play him well as a batting unit, it will really put Sri Lanka under pressure."Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jos Buttler(w), Jonathan Bairstow, Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Joe Root, James Tredwell, Chris Woakes, James Anderson, Ian Bell, Tim Bresnan, Eoin Morgan, Graeme Swann, Jonathan TrottSri Lanka (From): Angelo Mathews(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Kulasekara, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Chanaka Welegedara, Dinesh Chandimal, Shaminda Eranga, Mahela Jayawardene, Lasith Malinga, Kushal Janith Perera, Lahiru ThirimanneLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
