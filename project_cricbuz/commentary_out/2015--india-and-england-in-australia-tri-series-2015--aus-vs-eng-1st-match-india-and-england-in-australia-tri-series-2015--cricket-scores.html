Two slips to start off proceedings...The bowling for Australia was led by Starc, who started it all with the first ball of the game when he trapped Bell plumb in front. He struck again in the same over to send back Taylor and also got the important wicket of Morgan in the end. Doherty was economical with the ball and played perfect foil for the pacers at the other end. The target doesn't seem too big, but the pitch has something in it for the bowlers. Can the England bowlers make use of that and defend this total? Or will Australia chase this down easily? Join us in a few minutes to find out...Eoin Morgan has given his bowlers something to bowl at. At one stage, when they were 33/4, it looked like they will be bowled out well before 200. However, the newly appointed England skipper had other plans in mind. He first took his time to settle down and once he got a grip of the surface and the bowling, he cut loose. Buttler and Jordan played supporting roles and were involved in two crucial partnerships with Morgan.4

ENGLAND:0.1 Starc to Bell, out Lbw!! What a start for Australia! Wicket first ball and Starc gets the big fish! The Australians are ectstatic. An inswinger first up, Bell looks to defend , misses and is rapped low on the pads. The umpire raises his finger straightaway. No doubt about that. He was caught right in front of the stumps.

Two slips and a gully in placeBailey: "We would have loved to bat. Hopefully, the pitch will stay true for 100 overs. Starc and Cummins will be the quicks and we have a couple of all-rounders. The ground is much the same when we played South Africa a couple of months ago. It is important to keep building up, our one day cricket has been consistent over the past 12 months."Morgan: "We are going to have a bat first. The wicket is a little bit used. It is an opportunity to make first use of the pitch. The boys like coming here. I am excited to get started. Ian Bell has been in great touch, but today is a different game. We have plenty of match winners and we should get the combination right. Anderson misses out, but he will be fit for Brisbane."Teams:Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Steven Smith, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Xavier DohertyEngland (Playing XI): Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, Stuart Broad, Steven FinnEngland have won the toss and have opted to batJames Anderson still not fit and Tredwell misses out as England opt for only one spinner in Moeen Ali.With the World Cup being played in their own backyard, will the Australians be able to press the advantage? Or, will England finally find their groove? Toss, teams and all the answers coming up in a few minutes. Don't go anywhere...On the other hand, the hosts find themselves among familiar conditions. The only thing they will be hoping for is that Michael Clarke gets fit before the D-day. Meanwhile, George Bailey will be leading the team in ODIs and his past record has been impressive. Mostly the kangaroos will look to try different combinations to find a perfect fit for the World Cup. Glenn Maxwell will be under watchful scrutiny and the likes of David Warner and Aaron Finch will want to get as much runs as possible under their belts.After a gruelling 4-match Test series against India, Australia are all set to host a tri-series tournament involving England and India, which will offer much-needed practice before the World Cup. England will face the hosts in the opener being played at the SCG today. The situation has been tricky for England. They sacked their long-time skipper Alastair Cook just days before and this series will be an opportunity for the team to get adjusted to their new captain Eoin Morgan. But things have not been easy for Morgan as well. He has scored only one fifty in his last 19 innings and has not been in the best of forms. English cricket is at an all-time low, having won only 9 ODI games out of 24 in the last one year. They will hope to find some confidence before the big tourney, a task which will not be made easy by the resilient Australians.Preview:It is perhaps indicative of how England's prospects at the 2015 ICC World Cup are viewed by the media that on the eve of the team's tri-series opener against Australia at the SCG, captain Eoin Morgan found himself insisting that Kevin Pietersen has no place in England's ODI side - at least for the "foreseeable future". England cricket has hit a rough patch over the last year or so, starting with the 5-0 Ashes drubbing, Pietersen's subsequent exile and a string of ODI series defeats culminating in Alastair Cook's removal as captain and axing from the ODI squad, and now Morgan is left with the task of driving the team into some sort of form before England open their World Cup campaign at the MCG on February 14. And still, Pietersen - the most exciting batsman England produced in this era - dominates discussions of England and ODI cricket. The team now has at least four ODIs - five if they reach the ti-series final in Perth on February 1 - to figure out what combination to play at the World Cup, as well as get key players into some sort of form. Morgan's team goes into the tri-series on the back of a 5-2 loss in Sri Lanka, which itself came after they were beaten at home 4-1 by India. Sandwiched between a 4-1 loss in Australia and a 3-2 home defeat to Sri Lanka was England's only series win of 2014, a 2-1 win in the West Indies. England have won just nine of 24 ODIs in the last 12 months, and common across those matches were the inability of the batsman to put up big totals and the bowlers to click in unison. Going into the tri-series also featuring defending World Cup champions India, Morgan's challenge is to himself get into top form - he averages 24.28 in the last year - and inspire a flagging team. Cook's spot at the top has been taken by Ian Bell, who drilled 20 fours and three sixes during his 145-ball 187 against a Prime Minister's XI in Canberra on Wednesday, while Moeen Ali (71 off 49) and James Taylor (71 off 77) also got runs to secure their places at Nos 2 and 3. Morgan said at the pre-match press conference that Bell's innings epitomised the ruthlessness his side needed to succeed in the ti-series and the World Cup, and now the talk must be backed by replication down the order. With Stuart Broad back in the side after an injury break, the team gets some extra oomph. James Anderson is in doubt for the match as he battles to recover from a knee injury, sitting out of the win over the PM's XI. Australia do not have as many worries as England, though they will hope to have Michael Clarke fit for the World Cup. In his absence, the side will be led by George Bailey whose ODI record as a batsman is impressive but who, like Morgan, needs runs to increase his confidence for the mega-event. The hosts are likely to use the ti-series to fine-tune their plans, such as whether Glenn Maxwell can bowl ten overs of spin and if recalled left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty deserves to get playing time come February 14. World Cup debutants Aaron Finch and David Warner will be eager to get into ODI groove at the top, while Shane Watson is desperately in need of runs to confirm his place in the World Cup XI. With Mitchell Marsh likely to be rested for the opener at the SCG, there could be a debut for local man Gurinder Sandhu if NSW team-mate Josh Hazlewood is rested after the India Tests and the management holds off on selecting Doherty.
