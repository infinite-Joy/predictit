Azhar Ali is on strike. Willey will open the attack2nd innings: Players from England are back on the field and they will hope that the 27-runs-in-the-last-5-overs stuckathon doesn't come back to bite them. The Pakistani opening duo jog out towards the 22-yards and will be secretly nervous about the target, given their twinning of chases and collapses far too often for comfort.Pakistan took pace off the ball and made life very difficult towards the end. Riaz was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets, while Mohammad Irfan and debutant Iftikhar Ahmed picked up one each. Yasir Shah had a poor outing with the ball as he was taken for a lot of runs. This is a tricky target for Pakistan. It is not a small one, but at the same time, it is not big enough. It will be all about who handles the pressure better. Will the dew factor play a role? Take a break and join us back in a while for the run chase...England have got a good total on the board, but Pakistan have pulled things back towards the end. At 240/2 in 42 overs with Morgan and a set Root at the crease, 300 was easily on the cards, but a tremendous fightback by the Pakistani bowlers, led by Wahab Riaz, meant the visitors were denied at least 25-30 runs at the death. Earlier, after opting to bat, Roy and Hales shared a century opening stand, before the former was dismissed. Hales carried on and recorded his maiden ODI hundred. Root too chipped in with a handy fifty - his 10th in ODIs - but the rest of the batsmen struggled to cope with the slowness of the pitch.4

ENGLAND:47.5 Riaz to Buttler, out Bowled!! Wicket number three for Riaz and he deserves it. He's bowled exceptionally well. Good slower delivery, shows that he is not a one dimensional bowler. It was slightly down the leg-side, Buttler didn't read it from the hand and was ready for the slog, but the ball came slowly onto him, he tried to flick in the end, but the ball ricocheted onto the stumps off the back pad.

Irfan will open the attackTeams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Babar Azam, Mohammad Hafeez, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Mohammad IrfanEngland (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Reece TopleyAzhar Ali: "We need to focus on the basics. The fielding has improved in the last 6 odd months. Two changes, Iftikhar Ahmed is making his debut and Mohammad Rizwan comes back."Eoin Morgan: "We are going to bat first. We are playing on the same wicket. Hopefully we can rectify the mistakes we did the other day. I think it will spin a bit more today. We have an unchanged side."England have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "This is not a fresh pitch. It is a tired-looking pitch. The cracks have opened up but the groundsmen have told me that they have watered it a bit. There may be something in there for the cutters and the slower balls. The new ball will be the best time to bat," reckons Nick Knight.Pakistan gave a fitting farewell to Younis Khan a couple of days ago. A combined effort from their bowlers meant England could not post a competitive total. In reply, Mohammad Hafeez led from the front with a magnificent hundred, while young Babar Azam also chipped in with a handy fifty. Apart from James Taylor and Eoin Morgan, none of the England batsmen batted sensibly. It is a crucial game for the visitors. Can their batsmen take more responsibility and play well today? Time will tell. Pakistan will be making a forced change today after Younis Khan's retirment. Will Ahmed Shehzad get a game? We'll find out soon...Preview:Good fielding, along with solid efforts with both the bat and the ball, helped Pakistan take a 1-0 lead in the One Day International (ODI) series against England and the 'hosts' will be eager to put on another all-round performance and extend their dominance over the tourists. This being a four-match series, England need to win this game if they are to keep their hopes alive for a series victory, and Eoin Morgan, the limited-overs skipper, will be expecting a better show from his team after their under-whelming performance in the opening game.While Pakistan's start mirrored that of England in the first ODI, Mohammad Hafeez and Babar Azam's superb partnership made all the difference in the end. Skipper Azhar Ali, who will be pleased with their performance, will also hope for the rest of the batsmen, including himself, to show better application. The captain as well as Bilal Asif were found wanting against England seamers' persistence to attack the middle stump. Shoaib Malik too will be eager to come up with a substantial contribution, having failed to convert a promising start and leaving Pakistan in a spot of bother in the first game. With Younis Khan's ODI retirement, a spot is vacant in the batting line-up and Pakistan will look at including Ahmed Shehzad, who will add solidity to the top order.Pakistan's bowlers were on the mark with Mohammad Irfan and Anwar Ali giving the team a good start and the spinners pitching in later. There were certain periods in the game when the bowlers appeared to run out of ideas when a couple of partnerships prospered for England. While such rescue stands are often the case after a collapse, coach Waqar Younis will want the bowlers to go for the kill and not let the batsmen off the collars.When it comes to England's batting, Morgan's team do have a few issues at the top of the order. Since his knock of 67 against New Zealand in June 2015, Alex Hales has gone seven innings without a meaningful contribution - his highest in those seven innings being 22. Jason Roy impressed with a couple of half-centuries against Australia in September, but he too has failed in his last three outings - last last two being single digit scores, including a duck in the first ODI. While having a world-class batsman like Joe Root in the line-up is always a huge plus, the rest of the batsmen too need to make their presence felt. Barring Eoin Morgan and James Taylor, none of the England batsmen appeared comfortable at the crease.Reece Topley was the pick of the seam bowlers as he bagged three wickets and did not give much away. Chris Woakes too was economical, although he did not taste much success in terms of wickets. David Willey went for a few runs and England will be hoping the he pulls up the socks. Among spinners, Moeen Ali kept things tight at his end, but he did not receive much support from Adil Rashid, who was wayward and went for a lot of runs. Doing the basics right, hitting the right lengths and bowling with discipline, as clichd as it might sound, would do a world of good for the England bowlers.Teams:Pakistan (From): Azhar Ali(c), Bilal Asif, Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan, Shoaib Malik, Babar Azam, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Irfan, Zafar Gohar, Ahmed Shehzad, Rahat Ali, Aamer Yamin, Mohammad RizwanEngland (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Reece Topley, Jonny Bairstow, Liam Plunkett, Sam Billings, Chris JordanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
