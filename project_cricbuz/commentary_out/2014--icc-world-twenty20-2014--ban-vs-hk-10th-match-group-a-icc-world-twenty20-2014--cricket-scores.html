Or will Bangladesh fightback and go through to the main draw with a 100% record.Tanwir Afzal lit up a dream start for Hong Kong, slaying Tamim and Sabbir is the very first over. Anamul, Shakib and Mushfiq all threw their wickets away after finding their groove to leave Bangladesh in trouble. The hosts, losing themselves in the labyrinth of mad-cap slogging eventually folded for 108 inside 17 overs. Can Hong Kong complete an upset win? Join us back in a short while.If Hong Kong chase down the target in less than 13.2 overs, then the hosts are out of the main draw. I bet the Nepal fans are licking their lips in anticipation of a huge achievement.1
