Two slips in place as Dawlat steams in..So that brings us to the end of this topsy-turvy innings, but both teams would take 236 given the circumstances they were in during the contest. Mohammad Shahzad was back to his usual fiery self as he stroked his way to a well-calcuated 81 and was helped by some ordinary fielding by the hosts. With the captain in the middle for company, the experienced duo stitched together a 76-run partnership and laid a solid foundation for the batsmen to follow. However, the Irish bowlers pulled things back commendably in the middle stages of the game by picking wickets at regular intervals to have the visitors reeling at 170 for 7. However, the former captin Nabi and Rashid Khan then managed to save the blushes and ensured that their team had something for their bowlers to bowl at. We'll be back shortly with the chase..4
