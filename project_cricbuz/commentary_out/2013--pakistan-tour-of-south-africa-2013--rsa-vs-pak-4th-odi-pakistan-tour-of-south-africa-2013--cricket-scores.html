On a sluggish track, they should be able to chase this one down.Pakistan started off in sensational fashion as Mohammad Irfan picked up two wickets in the first two balls of the match. Graeme Smith and Farhaan Behardien also departed cheaply before AB de Villiers and David Miller strung a 115 run stand for the fifth wicket. Both batsmen registered fifties on a wicket that was not easy to bat on. In the Batting powerplay, Saeed Ajmal wreaked havoc as he picked up three wickets.
