The 'Gong' and the 'Bongs' have gone completely silent. 30 minutes back when Tamim was in full flow, they were busy clearing their throats. Now it is back to nervous moments and silence, with a prayer on their lips. They need someone - who is calm and calculated, to steer the ship and take their side home. As Nasser says, you don't need a player to play a gorgeous 'shot of the day' and get out, but one who will knuckle down and win it for them.That will be drinks as well.

BANGLADESH:14.4  Bresnan to Kayes, no run, a nervous poke, tentative and Kayes is looking like he may get out anytime, fullish and in the channel outside off, Kayes limply pushed out at that and is lucky that it did not catch the edge
BANGLADESH:14.3  Bresnan to Shakib Al Hasan, 1 run, Shakib Al Hasan is looking edgy and that shot proves that, short and wide outside off, Shakib Al Hasan reached out for it, to cut, bottom edged it on the bounce to the left of Prior who half stopped itBresnan is coming round the wicket, a slight change in plan as he has a slip in place too.

BANGLADESH:13.4  Shahzad to Hasan, out Bowled!! The crowd have gone completely silent and what a peach of a delivery to get Hasan out. Coaches always say to their fast bowlers, that the aim should be to hit off stump and that's exactly what Shahzad does. Landed on off and skidded off the pitch, Hasan seemed to have everything covered as he went back to defend, the ball snuck past the outside edge and knocked back the off stump. Hasan played slightly inside the line and was squared up too. Shahzad exults. He can be a dangerous customer when it is nibbling and it certainly is moving now. Hasan b Shahzad 0(2) Shahzad to Hasan, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

BANGLADESH:12.3  Bresnan to Kayes, no run, beaten, lovely channels that Bresnan is bowling as Roqibul comes out to bat and he is at the non-strikers' end. Pushed across Kayes who felt for the ball and it beat him all ends up
BANGLADESH:12.2  Bresnan to Siddique, out Siddique Run Out!! Direct hit, direct hit and Siddique goes back to the pavilion. Siddique almost dragged it back onto the stumps, he did not know where the ball was, Kayes was haring across for the single, Siddique had to go, Anderson ran from mid wicket, took the ball, turned around blind and then threw down the stumps at the non-strikers' end. The bail just about came out off the groove as Siddique's bat was inches short. A frame here and there, but the frame that Siddique needed to save him did not. England are fighting back into this. Siddique run out (Anderson) 12(12) [4s-2] Bresnan to Siddique, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Looks like Anderson has got Siddique out. What a terrific throw from Andy too. He is one of the best fielders in the England camp, though he is a fast bowler. The third umpire being called for and after lots of replays he gives it out.

BANGLADESH:10.5  Bresnan to Kayes, 2 runs, good work from a Pakistani (Shahzad) and a Punjabi (Bopara) from India. No this is not an India v Pakistan game. It is England v Bangladesh.

BANGLADESH:10.1  Bresnan to Siddique, FOUR!!, an educated edge runs through the vacant slip, it was guided with an open face, maybe played intentionally and it runs away to the left of Matt PriorTalking about predictions, here comes another one. This time from Michael Vaughan, courtesy twitter. He says England will win by 23 runs.
BANGLADESH:9.6  Swann to Kayes, no run, Kayes makes room and tries to go inside out, finds cover and Matt Prior says from behind: 'Bowling Swanny, there you go Swannny.' We have seen that many times before, haven't we?

BANGLADESH:9.4  Swann to Kayes, no run, tossed up on the stumps, Kayes gets forward and defends

BANGLADESH:9.2  Swann to Siddique, FOUR!!, a gift from Swann, friendly full toss on leg stump, Siddique flicked it powerfully past mid wicket and it raced across the fast outfield, rubbish from Swann, maybe it slipped out of his hand, dew is playing a part here

BANGLADESH:8.4  Bresnan to Iqbal, out Bowled!! Timothy Bresnan, you beauty! England certainly needed that and the capacity 'Gong' with a lot of 'Bongs' in it go quiet. Their home-town boy is gone and it needed quite a good delivery to get rid of him. Cross-seam delivery, landed on off and skidded through, Iqbal was late in bringing his bat down and tried to waft across the line, a gap between bat and pad, Bresnan finds that gap and the ball hits the top of off stump. Strauss does his trade-mark celebration - a little fist pump with his left hand and runs up to Bresnan to hug him. Iqbal b Bresnan 38(26) [4s-5] Bresnan to Iqbal, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
BANGLADESH:8.3  Bresnan to Iqbal, no run, full delivery on off stump, Iqbal tried to drill that hard down the ground and mistimed it completely, straight to the fielder at mid off
BANGLADESH:8.2  Bresnan to Iqbal, 2 runs, flicked to deep mid wicket for a couple, easily done
BANGLADESH:8.1  Bresnan to Iqbal, no run, What has happened there? England don't review it, it hit the top of the pad, the flap as Iqbal was late on the cut shot, England had a mini-conference, then decided against it, even if they had gone for it, it would've been not-out, I'm talking about the LBW of course as it was missing offTim Bresnan [1.0-0-6-0] is back into the attack

BANGLADESH:6.6  Anderson to Iqbal, FOUR!!, Shot Maannnnnnnnnn! That's how Iqbal killed off India in the 2007 WC. He was 18 or so then, now 4 years older and much more mature, though the class and the grace is still there, it was a regulation half volley and Iqbal planted his front foot forward and thumped it past cover, no one moved and the fielders just stood and admired the cracker of a cover drive
BANGLADESH:6.5  Anderson to Iqbal, no run, clipped to short fine, straight to the fielder
BANGLADESH:6.4  Anderson to Iqbal, 2 runs, now that's deftness at his best, Iqbal knows that to get it in the gap, he has to open the face and he does so getting it past a diving backward point, already the dew is playing a part here and the towels are out, problems for England
BANGLADESH:6.3  Anderson to Iqbal, no run, fullish on off and Iqbal leant forward to drive on the up, mistimed to mid off
BANGLADESH:6.2  Anderson to Iqbal, FOUR!!, It keeps getting better and the Chittagong crowd go crazy. Shades of BC Lara, not a bad ball at all, short of length on the hips, Iqbal got inside the line and created his own room before swivelling to short-arm pull, one leg was up in the air too and deep square moving to his left had no chance, one bounce over the ropes and a banner in the crowd reads: 'Boom Boom Tamim'. Ha!

BANGLADESH:5.2  Bresnan to Kayes, FOUR!!, Graceful! One of the better off drives or the straight drive if you may call it, high front elbow, full face of the bat and the ball scurries past mid off, the openers are putting the pressure right back on England, they are off to a fine start

BANGLADESH:4.6  Anderson to Iqbal, FOUR!!, Cracker, Iqbal in front of his home crowd is playing a beautiful innings. A little cameo so far and he is entertaining the crowd with those delectable flicks, one-legged clip and it races across the turf like greased lightning, timed superbly and Iqbal walks up to Kayes to have a word, the crowd admire the shot and shout, clearing their throats
BANGLADESH:4.5  Anderson to Kayes, 1 run, on the hips and Kayes turns the wrists on it to help it down to fine leg
BANGLADESH:4.4  Anderson to Kayes, no run, back of a length and on off stump, defended to the right of Colly at backward point
BANGLADESH:4.3  Anderson to Kayes, no run, short of length and rising into the ribs, Kayes tries to help the pull down past Prior, it takes the glove and goes to the right of the keeper
BANGLADESH:4.2  Anderson to Kayes, no run, slanted across on a good length, it was outside off, Kayes shoulders arms
BANGLADESH:4.1  Anderson to Iqbal, 3 runs, Iqbal is playing that tuck off his pads so well, it was leg-stumpish and he got slightly forward and closed the face before clipping it past 3 men on the on side, Bresnan slides to pull it back
BANGLADESH:3.6  Shahzad to Kayes, no run, Oooh! Kayes almost closed the face a bit too early, it was full on middle, the leading edge dribbles away along the ground to the off side

BANGLADESH:3.4  Shahzad to Iqbal, no run, Iqbal gets forward and drives the full pitched delivery to mid off, again the fielder had to moved quickly to cut it off
BANGLADESH:3.3  Shahzad to Iqbal, no run, that's where he should bowl, on or around off stump, punched with a full face to mid on
BANGLADESH:3.2  Shahzad to Iqbal, FOUR!!, totally wrong line that, pedestrian stuff from Shahzad and the crowd find their voices, it was down leg and Iqbal flicked it away past Morgan who is a lot squarer at deep square, went too quickly and beat him easily
BANGLADESH:3.1  Shahzad to Kayes, 1 run, driven away from the body, it was full and outside off, square driven well wide of backward point
BANGLADESH:2.6  Anderson to Iqbal, FOUR!!, Anderson would not like that one bit, though he bowled a poor delivery, Iqbal plays those one-legged pulls so well, he does again, swivelling around and helping it down to fine leg, Shahzad slid to his left and got his body behind it, but since the outfield is quick, the ball moves away from his grasp and rolls to the fence
BANGLADESH:2.5  Anderson to Kayes, 1 run, runs off the thick outer edge, all along the ground down to third man, Kayes was shaping to defend and it ran away
BANGLADESH:2.4  Anderson to Kayes, no run, short of length and on the off stump, Kayes goes on the backfoot and defends it down to short mid
BANGLADESH:2.3  Anderson to Kayes, no run, slanted across Kayes on a good length, he lifts his bat and lets it go
BANGLADESH:2.2 Anderson to Iqbal, 1 run, solid forward defensive shot, compactly done by Iqbal and he gets a single as the ball rolls wide of cover
BANGLADESH:2.1  Anderson to Iqbal, no run, short of length outside off, Iqbal stands tall and punches it on the off side
BANGLADESH:1.6  Shahzad to Kayes, no run, Ripper, finally after 5 boring deliveries, Shahzad gets it right, definite away swing, pitched outside off and drew Kayes into the forward drive, then it moved away a tad to beat the edge, lovely position of the seam as it nestles in Prior's gloves
BANGLADESH:1.5  Shahzad to Iqbal, 1 run, same ball, same shot and it was down leg, you know the end result, don't you?
BANGLADESH:1.4  Shahzad to Kayes, 1 run, wrong ball, or the wrong line, wristed away to fine leg, Kayes is off the mark
BANGLADESH:1.3  Shahzad to Iqbal, 3 runs, beautiful flick, overpitched on the pads, Iqbal just leant forward and used his wrists to place it down to deep square leg, the outfield is quick and a desperate dive from Morgan running to his right from fine leg saves a run
BANGLADESH:1.2  Shahzad to Iqbal, 2 runs, nice tuck off the pads, it was on a short of length and into middle stump, Iqbal closes the face of the bat early and eases it wide of square leg
BANGLADESH:1.1  Shahzad to Iqbal, no run, Shahzad ambles in and angles in on a good length outside off, Iqbal sees it watchfully and shoulders armsAjmal Shahzad, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackShahzad starts off from round the wicket straight away to the lefties with a lone slip in place. He will get it to move off the seam and won't get much swing I reckon.A gem from the funny David Bumble Lloyd on air: We are at the 'Gong' (Chittagong) and we are in the 'Desh' (Bangladesh).
BANGLADESH:0.6  Anderson to Kayes, no run, once again hit on the abdomen area, it was rising from a short of length area and caught Kayes in the mid riff area, after a couple of loose balls, Anderson is getting the white ball to swing back in and already the openers are feeling the heat
BANGLADESH:0.5  Anderson to Kayes, no run, nervous forward defensive from Kayes as the ball takes the inner edge and rolls back onto his front pad
BANGLADESH:0.4  Anderson to Kayes, no run, stifled appeal from Anderson and the slip fielders, this one swung back in the air, pitched on middle and caught Kayes on the thigh guard, would have gone over the stumps and England rightly don't take the review
BANGLADESH:0.3  Anderson to Kayes, no run, in the channel, on a good length outside off, Kayes shoulders arms
BANGLADESH:0.2  Anderson to Iqbal, 1 run, once again wrong line from Anderson, down leg and Iqbal just about gets a faint tickle, to the naked eye it looked like it went off the pad, but Rod Tucker gives it as runs
BANGLADESH:0.1  Anderson to Iqbal, 2 runs, to fine leg, back of a length delivery and rising into the ribs, Iqbal gets inside the line, to tuck it, the ball rears up on him and goes down to fine leg, Iqbal is off the mark with a couple to a cacophony of cheers from the crowdIqbal and Kayes are at the crease. Iqbal is on strike. Anderson will open the attackIt should be a cracker of a game and Bangladesh will go hard at the new ball. Tamim who has disappointed big time, needs to fire for his side. Remember that this is a must win game for them and the pressure will be on the home side if they lose a few early on. The players are walking out to the middle. The umpires are out there too. Dew will play a part too later on. Tamim will take strike.The chase: Right, I will let the cat out of the bag. It was not Thiru, but me (Srivathsa) who made both the predictions - England getting over 250 and Ireland winning - and both were way off the mark. Sincere aplogies to 'Realtime' and we move on. Time for the Bangladeshi chase. It won't be easy chasing on this. Swann will be a big factor and I expect Collingwood to trundle in and bowl those slow off-cutters. Maybe even Bopara might bowl on this. Shahzad will get it to reverse as the ball gets old and Anderson will swing it both ways with the new nut.Morgan: Feels good to be back in the mix, it was good to bat with Trotty. The wicket is dry, conducive to spin and the ball was keeping low. The dew usually comes into play over here, but we hope it does not affect much today. With the fielding unit that we have, we would like to put pressure on them.It is not an easy surface to bat on and the batting of Bangladesh have been less than desired in the last couple of matches. The English bowlers must enjoy bowling on this pitch as they attempt to defend this total. It is a must win game for Bangladesh and it will be interesting to see as to how they will get about doing the chase. Do join us for the chase in a short while.The Bangladesh comeback was spectacular though as Morgan was dismissed just when England envisioned hopes of something around 250. The middle order and the later order came unstuck against some disciplined line and length bowling as they continued to lose wickets at regular intervals. Collingwood, who surprisingly came in at No. 8 was left stranded as wickets fell in a heap to complete the Bangladeshi comeback.England struggled to get going on a pitch which aided the slower bowlers to end up with an unimpressive total. The openers looked at ease against the pacers but things began to unravel for the English batsmen with the advent of spin. Prior looked clueless when he literally walked into his own doom as he forgot the basics of cricket to walk out of the crease with the ball firmly with the keeper. Strauss and Bell fell cheaply thereafter as England were reduced to 53/3. It was left to the calm head of Trott and the dynamic batting of Morgan to revive the English innings. The two featured in a fine partnership of 109 runs to rescue England from choppy waters.4
ENGLAND:49.4  Hossain to Collingwood, out Collingwood Run Out!!1 run completed, Collingwood is not third time lucky out here, this one was a full toss, Collingwood was late into the pull, the ball fell in no man's land towards mid wicket, Collingwood wanted strike again, Mahmudullah came running in from deep mid wicket and hurls in a direct hit to the batsman's end, Collingwood puts in a desperate dive but in vain. The umpire didn't even need the help of the third umpire, England are bundled out for 225. Collingwood run out (Mahmudullah) 14(13) Hossain to Collingwood, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!
ENGLAND:49.3  Hossain to Collingwood, 2 runs, too full again, drilled down to long on, the ball didn't go as quickly as it went last time around, this was an easy two but the fielder does well, goes to the keeper's end this time, but replays showed that Collingwood was well inThe umpire has gone up for the third umpire. Collingwood is the man in question. Is he run out?
ENGLAND:49.2  Hossain to Collingwood, 2 runs, Collingwood swings across the line, calls for two, the fielder at long on had to go to the keeper's end, he sends a wayward throw to the bowler, Naeem Islam was the fielder, Rahim is not happy with that, he is yelling at the fielder
ENGLAND:49.1  Hossain to Anderson, 1 run, length ball pushed across, Anderson steers it to pointWell, another incident that questions the rules regarding the UDRS. Bangladesh had no reviews left, but they appealed for a caught-behind forcing the umpires to go for the umpire's review. Nasser and Sir Ian Botham aren't happy with that, they reckon that it should not have gone up to the third umpire at all.
ENGLAND:48.6 Shafiul Islam to Collingwood, no run, And Colly can't get the single! Superbly bowled, too full outside the off stump, Collingwood gets his bat down, looked like it was a bump ball, half appeal from the Bangladeshis as the keeper collects it, not-out!Shakib is having a word or two with his bowler, is he getting his fielders in? Fine leg comes up!

ENGLAND:48.1  Shafiul Islam to Shahzad, out Bowled!! The middle stump goes for a toss! It was back of a length angled in, Shahzad made room and looked to go inside out, he misses and the ball collides with the stump cam that's on the middle stump, Boy!

ENGLAND:47.3  Hossain to Bresnan, out Caught by Shafiul Islam!! The misery continues for England, it was a full toss, not too high to be called a no ball, Bresnan cleared his front leg looking to swing it across, the face of the bat turned, he ended up slicing it in the air, the ball went up in the air and landed in the safe hands of Shafiul Islam at short third man, Bresnan wanted to make sure that it wasn't a no-ball, the umpires decide for a while and give it out! Bresnan c Shafiul Islam b Hossain 2(2) Hossain to Bresnan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Bresnan has been caught, but he is staying there, the umpires are checking whether the full toss was over waist height.
ENGLAND:47.2  Hossain to Collingwood, 1 run, similar to the previous delivery, the ball goes racing to long on but they settle for a single
ENGLAND:47.1  Hossain to Collingwood, 2 runs, that's a run out chance that's been let away by Hossain! Collingwood swipes across the line and gets it wide of long on, decides to go back for the second, Bresnan was struggling to reach the other end, the throw was good and quick, but Hossain fails to collect the ball, replays showed that Bresnan was way short
ENGLAND:46.6  Shakib Al Hasan to Bresnan, 2 runs, given a bit of air, driven through extra cover and mid off, good running, they complete the second with utmost ease
ENGLAND:46.5  Shakib Al Hasan to Collingwood, 1 run, Collingwood goes back and whips it to mid wicket
ENGLAND:46.4 Shakib Al Hasan to Swann, out Caught&Bowled!! Well, that's why they say, you can ride on luck but not for long. Swann went for the reverse sweep, got the toe end and the ball ballooned up in the air, Shakib placed himself right under it after going a couple of steps to his left, takes it cleanly and pouches it to his chest, no major celebrations but Shakib Al Hasan has a happy look on his face. Remember, his house was stoned after the loss to West Indies. This performance of theirs would silence all the harsh critics.

ENGLAND:44.1  Razzak to Bopara, 1 run, Bopara creates a lot of room and pushes it to cover, quick single but easily done in the end

ENGLAND:35.1  Shakib Al Hasan to Trott, no run, punched off the backfoot to short cover, straight to the fielderDrinks are on the field now Another interesting piece of nugget from Nasser on air: The Bangladeshis were quite happy that KP was in the England side as they have a couple of left arm spinners. But once they knew that Morgan came in as KP's replacement, they were shelling bricks in their pants as they know how good Morgan is. Morgan had played a blinder of a knock last year in an ODI against them to deny a sure victory. And once again Morgan has played well under pressure. Can he get to a ton? We will see as the players take a break.

ENGLAND:31.6  Shakib Al Hasan to Trott, no run, What a bad review by Shakib Al Hasan, it was not caught behind as Rahim dropped the ball, Shakib Al Hasan appealed for an LBW, that's what I'm guessing, good ball, Trott pushed inside the line to defend, the ball went past his bat and hit the back pad, replays showed that there was no edge, and it would've clipped the outside of off stump, since the original decision was not-out, it stood, Shakib Al Hasan isn't impressed, but if you go for such reviews, you don't have any reason to complainReview time: Looks like we have the second worst review of the tournament. And it is been ruled not-out by Daryl Harper. Shakib Al Hasan immediately took the review, despite Rahim dropping the ball. Shakib Al Hasan is now talking to Harper after the original decision stood and shakes his head. They don't have any reviews left

ENGLAND:27.1  Hossain to Trott, FOUR!!, Dear Hossain - you don't bowl there to Trott, if you do, then it will go the fence at will all day, harmless length delivery on the middle and leg stump line, Trott got inside the line and then stylishly whipped it over square leg, deep square leg was too wide and he had no chanceA fascinating conversation going on between Athers and Sir Ian on air: Athers was talking about how Morgan was netting in Dublin as he attempted to get back to competitive cricket after having been ruled out of the World Cup. Athers wonders whether Morgan was watching the England v Ireland game and if he was says a part of him would've felt happy that Ireland won, a major part of him in fact he corrects himself. Sir Ian responds: If Morgan was happy, then he would not be telling any of his England mates. Ha!

ENGLAND:24.6  Mahmudullah to Morgan, 1 run, ordinary running between the two, in the end Trott survives, he was late off the blocks and Naeem Islam from short cover could not hit directThird ump called for.

The national anthems were just played. It's always a nice sight to watch a big crowd singing their country's anthem with pride on their faces. Talking about big crowds, it's a full house today. Will that help the Bangladesh players or work against them? We'll find out soon. This is Karthik L starting off the commentary. Let's hope for a cracker of a game!Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Raqibul Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan(c), Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul IslamEngland (Playing XI): Andrew Strauss(c), Matt Prior(w), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan, Paul Collingwood, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Ajmal ShahzadTrott: I don't read too much into the stats (when asked about his batting average), I take calculated risks and play the game according to the situation. The conditions are different and we need to adapt quickly. Morgan has played some terrific knocks, he brings quality to the game. He is a good talent, very unique.Bangladesh have won the toss and elected to fieldStrauss: It is a good wicket to bat on, we need to get some runs on the board. Obviously Morgan comes in place of KP, Yardy and Broad are out. Collingwood and Shahzad come in. Prior will open the innings. It is going to be a tough match for us.Bangladesh: We will field first, Ashraful is out and Mahmudullah is in. We have given a thought to what went wrong against West Indies and we won't repeat the same mistakes.Pitch report: There is a little bit of grass on the wicket, it looks hard, and the seamers will enjoy a bit more bounce on this wicket. Looks at a much better cricket pitch than the ones we have seen. This may be a high scoring game feels Sir Ian Botham.Swann: Injuries are injuries, we can't do much with them but, it is good to have such worthy replacements. Morgan is one of the most interesting batsmen right now, and it is good to have him. However, it is sad to lose a player like KP. Bangladesh are a strong side, we have to turn up and face that exciting challenge.Hello folks, big game for the co-hosts Bangladesh as they lock horns with England at Chittagong. After a crushing defeat against the Windies, this turns out to be more of a do or die encounter for them. England, on the other hand, have had mixed fortunes so far in the tournament after losing to Ireland and winning the nail-biting thriller against South Africa. Who will turn out to be the better of the unpredictables? Will Bangladesh step up and calm down their angry supporters? This is Ajith, I will take you through the day along with Karthik, Pradeep and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we have more updates to come your way.By Saurabh SomaniTen days ago in the World Cup, England had just lost to Ireland and Bangladesh had not yet played West Indies. At that point, if asked about the prospects of the England-Bangladesh match at Chittagong, the predictions would have been on the lines of "Bangladesh have a very real possibility of causing an upset."
Ten days is a long time in cricket though. Since then, Bangladesh have capitulated against West Indies, and England rose from the dead against South Africa. And suddenly, the words "upset" and "possible" seem a tad more unlikely for Bangladesh.Bangladesh: They came into the World Cup with a mountain of expectation - but the problem was it was a mountain that was neither realistic nor an easy burden to bear. Realistically, a good result for Bangladesh would have been to reach the quarter-finals, but realism and fans expectations don't often co-habit the same planet, with the result that Bangladesh's cricketers were expected to easily make it to the quarters and perhaps even progress further from there. That the weight of unrealistic expectation has affected the team would be understating the case. They were beaten handily by India, managed a win against Ireland in a match that the Associate nation was in control of for large parts and were mauled by the West Indies. With all four established nations - India, South Africa, England and West Indies - considerably ahead of Bangladesh on points and net run rate, this makes their England match a must-win one. The main challenge for their players will be putting the demons of the past behind them before the match. Shakib al Hasan had his house stoned, and that is not the best frame of mind to play such an important cricket match in. Nevertheless, Shakib must lead from the front as he has done often in the past. Bangladesh also need Tamim Iqbal to rediscover the spark in his batting, that has so far been missing in this tournament. He scored runs against India, but at a rather more sedate pace than usual, but his innings against Ireland had more of the explosive Tamim that Bangladesh require. Tamim is the kind of player who can grab the initiative and keep it with his side for extended periods, and Bangladesh need that spark after the lows of last week.England: They lost to Ireland, and seemed set to be swamped by South Africa, and just when it appeared that England were pushing themselves into a corner from which it would be difficult to emerge, their bowlers turned it around for them. The two points against South Africa are invaluable for England after their loss to Ireland. They have suffered injury blows - both Stuart Broad and Kevin Pietersen have returned home - but in Eoin Morgan they have a superb replacement for Pietersen, while Ajmal Shahzad was decent when he replaced Broad against India on a featherbed. England will feel they are on the upswing after that remarkable win, though the upswing was slightly soured by the fact that their coach Andy Flower was not exactly diplomatic in his assessment of Pietersen's injury, saying that "the medical advice was that he could get through the tournament. So we hoped he would bit the bullet and continue."
The other problem for England will now be to find an opening partner for Andrew Strauss. Pietersen had looked to be growing into the role, but with him gone, the options are limited. On the plus side, Eoin Morgan's entry means England will have the finisher that they had lacked in earlier matches and their middle-order will be considerably strengthened. England will also want to avoid what they have made their own specialty at this World Cup: making every match a tense, nail-biting affair. A clean, clinical win will be good not just for their confidence but for the heart-rates of their fans as well.Head to Head:Of the 14 matches played between the teams, England have won 13, while Bangladesh have won only 1. In World Cups, the two sides have met just once, in 2007, with England victorious.Face off: Tamim Iqbal vs England's bowlers:Of all teams he has played in ODI cricket, Tamim's highest strike rate has been against England. He has scored runs at a superb 104.65 - the only team against whom he has scored at a 100-plus strike rate. This will be the ideal time for him to continue scoring like that.Quotes:"The boys are tense, but they are also confident that they can put up a good show." - Shakib al Hasan.
"We're not going to let you or the opposition know who it's going to be, but we've got a clear idea of who we want for the game against Bangladesh." - England coach Andy Flower was not revealing Strauss's opening partner.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Raqibul Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan(c), Mahmudullah, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Mohammad Ashraful, Nazmul Hossain, Shahriar Nafees, Suhrawadi ShuvoEngland (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Matt Prior(w), Michael Yardy, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Ajmal Shahzad, James Tredwell, Luke Wright, Chris TremlettLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
