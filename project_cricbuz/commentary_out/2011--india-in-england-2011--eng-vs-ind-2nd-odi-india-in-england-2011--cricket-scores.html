It might still be a greasy outfield though, something that will not be too pleasing to the injury ravaged Indian team.Parthiv Patel:  It was very frustrating. We wanted to play, the pitch looks very good. It is just a 23 over game but we are happy with it. It has been frustrating to sit in the dressing room and hoping that the rain will go away. I am lucky to have got the chance, with all the injuries around and I am confident about my game. It is almost like a 20-20 match and we would approach it like the same.The original cut-off time for this match to start was 7:17 pm local time. The match will start just 17 minutes before the cut-off time. There is a thick black cloud still hovering over the ground. Harsha Bhogle feels that it is moving away. One more shower though, the match is as good as abandoned, Sourav Ganguly feels that there will be at least one more shower before the match ends. Fingers crossed, there will be no more rain today.Teams:India (Playing XI): Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Rahul Dravid, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Manoj Tiwary, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Vinay Kumar, Munaf PatelEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Samit Patel, Ben Stokes, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Jade DernbachEngland have won the toss and elected to fieldM S Dhoni: We wanted to bowl as well.

It is good that we have been able to play the 7-4 combination, we have some decent options as a part time attack.Alastair Cook: The ground-staff have done a terrific job to get the ground ready. We have a couple of changes. Eoin is out unfortunately and has been replaced by Bopara. Swann replaces Trott. We are looking forward to register a win and are confident about our abilities. Swann is back after missing out the previous game.In the 23 overs, there will be 9 overs of powerplay. Five will be mandatory while two will be for the batting powerplay and two will be for the bowling powerplay.Aggerscricket has tweeted that the match will start at 7:00 PM local (11:30 PM IST).

We could have a 23 over game.Breaking News: Eoin Morgan has been ruled out of the ODI series due to a right shoulder injury.The latest update is that it is still raining at the Rose Bowl. Chances of any play happening look bleak. Let us keep our fingers crossed.The visuals at the ground show a typical UK like weather on a rainy day. It is grey, dull and windy with the rain pelting down. The inspection that was supposed to happen at 3:45 local time has been postponed.VaughanCricket's latest tweet has dashed optimism. It has started to rain again at the Rose Bowl. So, we continue to wait.Aggerscricket tweets: Hoping to inspect 3:45 local (8:15 PM IST). Still wet.Things have started to clear up at the Rose Bowl. It has stopped raining and there is good weather predicted for the rest of the day. The supper-sopper has done its rounds in the ground and it has soaked up the water in the outfield. Play could start in about an hour's time.Well, the rain has still not stopped at the Rose Bowl. Now, play must begin at 19:15 local time (23:45 PM IST) to ensure that we can get at least 20 overs. With the weather being so fickle, we are definitely in for a truncated match.Oh dear, the rain has picked up and it is pelting down here at the Rose Bowl. The forecast now is for persistent light rain for the day. Very gloomy conditions indeed.By the way, it is not raining at the moment. However, the conditions are far from ideal.Manoj Tiwary, the replacement for Rohit Sharma, arrived today morning and is expected to play in the match today.The local ground staff reckon that play could start somewhere between 4 PM and 6 PM local time if the weather clears up. However, once the rain stops, it will take 90 minutes for the ground to be ready for play.However, the conditions at Southampton are not so good. It has been raining steadily since early in the morning and it is drizzling. It is windy as well. However, conditions are expected to improve as the day progresses. For the moment, the covers are firmly in place.The wait for an Indian victory on this tour continues. After the washout at Durham, the focus now shifts to the second ODI at the Rose Bowl in Southampton. India have been dealt a major blow with Sachin Tendulkar being ruled out for 4-6 weeks. India will be praying that there are no more injuries. England will be hoping that to continue their winning momentum over the Indians.Preview by Saurabh SomaniSachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma... The Indian team almost seems to be sending a playing eleven back home, with hardly any men left standing to do national duty in England. It's been that sort of tour for India. When Dhoni said after the first Test that "everything that could go wrong, went wrong", little did know just how much he had under-estimated fate's ability to continue twisting knives in wounds - almost literally so.The result is that India will take the field with eleven men, but those eleven are not likely to resemble a balanced team. Here's a look:India: Manoj Tiwary, who was in good form in the Emerging Players tournament in Australia, may reach in time for the match but is unlikely to be ready to play. S Badrinath, who was named Tendulkar's replacement late on 5th September, would not have even arrived. The status on Ravindra Jadeja is still not clear, and - for those who take an uncharitable view - whether Jadeja being available will help or hinder India isn't too clear either. Among pure batsmen, the ones left standing are Ajinkya Rahane, Rahul Dravid, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina. Add Parthiv Patel and MS Dhoni as men who can bat, and that still makes for only six batsmen including the wicket-keeper. If Jadeja is available then he will get the seventh spot, but if he isn't, then India will go in with five pure bowlers. They haven't even done that in Test matches for a while, but circumstances being what they are, they won't have much choice - in which case Amit Mishra, who batted so pluckily in the fourth Test - is likely to make the cut as the fifth bowler, since the emphasis will be on getting the bowler with the best batting ability into the eleven. That sums up India's tour like nothing else: a bowler will make the eleven based on his batting ability.England: While England don't have India's walking-wounded problem, they do have some socks to pull up before the second ODI. So far, the tour has been as close to perfect as possible for the hosts, but ODI captain Alastair Cook was surely in a minority when he stated that he believed England could have won the first ODI if rain hadn't intervened. The fact is, England were very clearly and firmly on the back-foot for the first time in an international match in this series, and would have been hard-pressed to achieve a win from the position they were in. Their bowlers - so effective in the Tests - were not quite as sharp in the first ODI, and allowed India to post a very challenging score. In the brief time they were in the middle, the batsmen didn't impress too much either, with Cook himself getting out cheaply. Overall too, England's recent ODI record has been far less impressive than their Test record, and against a team that has already been battered on the field by them and off the field by injuries, it may be England's best chance to start correcting that.Weather Update: Significantly, the weather forecast for the Rose Bowl in Southampton is far from cheery. Heavy rain and wind are forecast, and there is a good chance the second ODI will go the way of the first.
