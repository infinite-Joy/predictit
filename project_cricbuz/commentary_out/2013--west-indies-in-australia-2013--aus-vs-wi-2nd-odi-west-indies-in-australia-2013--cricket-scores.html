They won the toss in the first ODI as well, and surprisingly, chose to bat. Today, they'll be bowling first. Russell is still not 100% fit so West Indies remain unchanged. Australia too have not made any changes.West Indies have won the toss and elected to field70 all out. That will be haunting Darren Sammy and co as the West Indies take on Australia once again at Perth for the second ODI. The visitors, needless to say, have to do a lot better than that today if they are to even compete. They sure are capable of doing that, so let's hope it's not another one sided game today. Australia are likely to remain unchanged, while West Indies may bring in Andre Russell, if he is fully fit.Teams:Australia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Matthew Wade(w), Ben Cutting, James Faulkner, Phillip Hughes, Clint McKay, Mitchell Starc, George Bailey, Xavier Doherty, Aaron Finch, Mitchell Johnson, Glenn Maxwell, Usman KhawajaWest Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Johnson Charles(w), Tino Best, Chris Gayle, Sunil Narine, Kieran Powell, Andre Russell, Devon Thomas, Dwayne Bravo, Narsingh Deonarine, Jason Holder, Kieron Pollard, Kemar Roach, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Darren BravoLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
