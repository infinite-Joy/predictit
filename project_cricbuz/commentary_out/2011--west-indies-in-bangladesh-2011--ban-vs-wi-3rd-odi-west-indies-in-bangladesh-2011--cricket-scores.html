The toss will be at 1:00 PM IST and the start will be at 1:30 PM IST. All this is provided that it does not rain now.Unfortunately, the weather is not great at the moment in Chittagong. It had rained yesterday night and there was a light drizzle even today. The covers are firmly in place and it looks in all certainty that the toss will be delayed. There will be an inspection at 12:30 PM IST.Hello and Welcome to the 3rd and final ODI between Bangladesh and West Indies from Chittagong. West Indies have been the better batting unit in this series. Simmons and Samuels have been the stars with the bat in this series and they will be looking to achieve a clean sweep.Preview:A rare series sweep beckons West Indies, which - even if against Bangladesh - will mean much to the Caribbean nation. It will be good for confidence for starters - since Bangladesh at home are not a pushover anymore, and in practical terms it will also give West Indies a valuable four ranking points in the new ODI ranking system. Skipper Darren Sammy made it clear that there would be no let up from his side in pursuit of victory, with the team determined to make a clean sweep of the series."We are not relaxed as we still have got a job to do," Sammy said ahead of the final match in Chittagong. "If we win the series 3-0, we will get four points in the new ranking system, so it's a very important match for us."West Indies are currently at the seventh spot in the ODI rankings, while Bangladesh are ninth. The visitors had started their tour on the wrong note, losing the one-off Twenty20 International after Bangladeshi skipper Mushfiqur Rahim played a stunning hand, but they have lorded it over the hosts in the ODI series, winning the first one by by 40 runs and the second by eight wickets in Dhaka last week. Sammy said his side was keen to maintain the winning momentum."We put in a very professional display in the one-day series and we want to continue that," he said. "We expect very competitive cricket, so we are going to focus on doing well."As for Bangladesh, they are under the gun in the series. Their fans are not likely to take a 3-0 loss very kindly, and instead of the come-from-behind Twenty20 win inspiring them to greater things, their performance so far has shown that the Twenty20 victory was an aberration. No Bangladesh batsman has crossed 70 for the series so far, and the only bowler to take at least a wicket and have an economy rate that is acceptable is Shakib al Hasan. Overall though, no Bangladesh bowler, except for Rubel Hossain, has more than 2 wickets in the two matches played so far.Bangladesh need a drastic improvement if they are to change their fortunes and avoid the ignominy of a white-wash. Given that they were shot out for 58 against West Indies during the 2011 World Cup, it was expected that the hosts would show more fight to erase that humiliation. For the one-day series, they have only one chance left to do so.The men to watch out for are West Indies batsmen Lendl Simmons and Marlon Samuels. Simmons followed his maiden one-day century in the opening match with an impressive 80 in the second, while Samuels has so far scored two successive half-centuries, and done so with an overall strike-rate that is greater than 100."There is a good atmosphere in the dressing-room," said Sammy. "Our batsmen are scoring runs and looking confident. Our bowlers are also doing well and we hope to put in a consistent performance."
