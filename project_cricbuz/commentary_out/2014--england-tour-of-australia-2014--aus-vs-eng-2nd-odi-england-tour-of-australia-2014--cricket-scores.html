AUSTRALIA:34.1 Bresnan to Haddin, out Caught by Cook!! I just get a feeling that, because Cook stationed a man at sweeper cover, Haddin looked to hit it straighter and in the process has lost his wicket. Good captaincy from Cook. Short of a length delivery just outside off stump, the ball bounces a bit more than Haddin anticipated, like in the previous over, Haddin tries to slap it over cover but gets a top edge, mid-off runs back to complete an easy catch. This is a vital breakthrough for England. They've broken this threatening 80-run match-winning stand. Haddin c Cook b Bresnan 26(35) [4s-2]Bresnan to Haddin, THATS OUT!!

Australia now require 301 to win.A much better performance by England after being outplayed all through the tour. Opting to bat, they got off to a decent start, but lost their way in the middle. But Morgan held one end together and he along with Buttler accelerated after the batting powerplay and carted all the bowlers all round the park.

It will be interesting to see how Australia approaches this total when they come out to bat. Join us back in about 35 minutes....4

ENGLAND:3.2 Johnson to Cook, FOUR, fast and full again from Johnson, probably looking to target Cook's pads as his feet aren't moving that well, but just gets the radar slightly wrong, the line was on the leg stump and that enabled Cook to clip it away to the deep backward square leg fence. First boundary of the game
ENGLAND:3.1 Johnson to Cook, no run, all at sea again Alastair Cook. Comprehensively beaten. Feet go nowhere and somehow, he doesn't kiss the ball. Short of a length delivery pitching around off, the ball nips away and opens up Cook who ends up poking, the ball zooms past the outside edge

McKay will open the attackTeams:Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Clint McKayEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Joe Root, Gary Ballance, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Tim Bresnan, Chris Jordan, Boyd RankinEngland have won the toss and have opted to batAustralia were hardly tested in the opening ODI at the MCG. Can England turn things around at the Gabba today and finally get a win against the hosts on the tour? Let's find out as the day progresses. Hello and a warm welcome to the second of the five ODIs of this series. The visitors would look to take some momentum out of their win over the Prime Minister's XI and thump Michael Clarke's men today. But life is certainly not going to be easy for them, especially with the return of Mitchell Johnson, who ran through the England top-order at will in the Ashes series. We are not too far away from knowing the playing XIs, toss and teams in a few minutes.PreviewAustralia will take on England for the second ODI of the series in Brisbane after deciding to give Shane Watson a long break, replacing him with Dan Christian. The hosts will be boosted with the return of Mitchell Johnson after some well-deserved rest. Not that England coped much better without their nemesis in the first one-dayer but some of their batsmen certainly looked more settled. Can England notch up their first win of a wretched tour Down Under on Friday?Australia: This has been a perfect season for Michael Clarke's men so far. They blanked England 5-0 in the Test series and started off with a convincing win to the ODIs. The captain himself has been in prime form and his limited overs specialists showed they are ready to assert themselves too. Such was Australia's dominance over England in the opening game, that Johnson's absence was not felt at all. Yes, the visitors managed a decent total on the board but 269 is not a major score in modern day ODIs and Australia crossed the hurdle without much fuss. Aaron Finch showed why he is the best man to partner David Warner as the duo posted a 163-run opening stand to write off England completely.Clint McKay bowled beautifully to return figures of 3/44 from his 10 overs and only some later order from Jos Butler helped England cross the 250-run mark. They have enough confidence now to rest their key players ahead of a challenging South African tour and it will be a good opportunity for the think tank to test the fringe players a year before the World Cup.Key Players: With Johnson back in the side, Australia's bowling attack will be shored up considerably. The left-arm seamer had rocked England with his pace and aggression in the Ashes and he will be certain to come hard at them again in the ODIs. Johnson weighs heavy on the scared English camp and it will not be easy for a battered set of tourists to overcome that stiff a challenge. Maybe the ODI specialists, without the scars of the five Test matches, would look to take him on, but that is easier said than done.The batting looks very strong at the moment with Finch, Warner and Clarke in terrific form. George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell can cause serious damage lower down the order but the Australians would want to see those two get tested more often at home.England: England have had a horror tour so far and they would be desperate for a victory against Australia. Nothing seems to be going right for them. The top-order did look a little more assured with Ian Bell, Gary Ballance and Eoin Morgan getting some runs. However, Alastair Cook and Joe Root's continued failures have posed some serious questions for the visitors.The bowling looked inept too as Australia blazed down their target without breaking a sweat. Rankin, Bresnan and Stokes were taken for a few runs but Chris Jordan stood out with a couple tight spells, during which he also knocked over Watson for a duck. Cook will look to his fast men to return Australia some of the hostility his own batsmen faced for nearly two months.Key Players: Jordan will be the key bowler for England, confident as he is after a good first game. The middle order batting also looks strong with the likes of Ballance and Morgan in the side. Stokes is a useful all-rounder and will be sure to chip in with healthy contributions. These are good limited overs cricketers, who need to get together for one strong show. Will Brisbane be it?Cook's role with the bat will be under the scanner but the southpaw is too classy and too good a player to keep missing out for too long. He is due and due big and when he gets runs, England are sure to look a far more settled side.QuotesI mentally needed that break. I don't think it will break my momentum at all. I'm looking forward to getting back to one-day cricket. - Mitchell Johnson, Australia seamerGiven Shane's workload in the past 12 months we consider it would be beneficial for him to have a longer break and continue his training programme at home in Sydney ahead of the final ODI and the tour of South Africa. - Darren Lehmann, Australia coachTeams:Australia (From): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Nathan Coulter-Nile, James Faulkner, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Xavier Doherty, James PattinsonEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Danny Briggs, Stuart Broad, Jos Buttler(w), Michael Carberry, Chris Jordan, Eoin Morgan, Boyd Rankin, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, James Tredwell, Chris WoakesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
