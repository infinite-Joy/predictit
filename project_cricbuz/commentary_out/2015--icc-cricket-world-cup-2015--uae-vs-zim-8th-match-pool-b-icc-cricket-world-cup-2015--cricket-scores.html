ZIMBABWE:42.6 Karate to C Ervine, out Caught&Bowled!! Oh! That is a very soft dismissal. Is there a twist in the tale? Slower delivery pitching around the off stump, Ervine checks his push, maybe it stopped on him and he ends up chipping it straight back to the bowler, who grabs it to his left in his followthrough. In fact, the ball took a sort of a leading edge as he closed the face of the bat. That ends a vital 83-run stand. C Ervine c and b Karate 42(32) [4s-2 6s-2]Karate to C Ervine, THATS OUT!!

ZIMBABWE:40.5 Naveed to Sean Williams, 1 run, good length delivery outside off stump, punched to cover-point and it's another misfield from UAE
ZIMBABWE:40.4 Naveed to Sean Williams, FOUR, sloppy fielding. Williams gets to his 18th ODI fifty. He's played a great innings under pressure. Williams flicks this along the ground, mid-on runs to his left and tries to stop the ball with a dive, but fumbles
ZIMBABWE:40.3 Naveed to Sean Williams, 2 runs, driven very hard to deep extra-cover and that's good enough for a couple of runs

ZIMBABWE:40.2 Naveed to Sean Williams, FOUR, no one at deep mid-wicket and Williams has made full use of it. A nothing short ball from Naveed, Williams pulls well and sends it along the ground. Looks like UAE have lost hope. Their body language is not looking great

ZIMBABWE:38.5 Karate to Sean Williams, FOUR, this time Williams slogs one over mid-wicket. Has that carried all the way? No it has just bounced inside the boundary cushion. Can't really bowl full at Karate's pace and he pays the penalty
ZIMBABWE:38.4 Karate to C Ervine, 1 run, driven away to long-on
ZIMBABWE:38.3 Karate to C Ervine, SIX, my word! He's bludgeoned that! It was an authoritative shot from Ervine.

ZIMBABWE:38.1 Karate to Sean Williams, 1 run, slower delivery outside off stump, Williams works it wide of long-on
ZIMBABWE:37.6 Aziz to Sean Williams, 1 run, 'catch it' is the cry, but I am not sure if it carried to the fielder at extra-cover.

ZIMBABWE:36.1 Karate to C Ervine, no run, Ervine goes leg-side, but only manages to mistime this good length delivery towards cover

ZIMBABWE:35.1 Aziz to Sean Williams, no run, flatter ball from round the wicket, punched back to the bowlerBatting powerplay has been enforced.This is still not out of Zimbabwe's reach. They need these two to carry until 42 overs. Remember, Chigumbura is yet to come and he can hit the ball long and hard. We are heading for a tense finish!However, for a brief period, Brendan Taylor, with a stamp of effortless batsmanship played sweeps and reverse sweeps to find gaps with needlepoint precision and lift the sagging morale of Zimbabwe. Aziz then, snared the wicket of Taylor by dismissing him LBW. Taylor took the review, but the Hawk-Eye suggested that the ball was going on to hit the leg-stump and Taylor had to take a long walk back to the pavilion. To make it worse for Zimbabwe, Solomon Mire's wicket was taken by Mohammad Naveed. Zimbabwe certainly need Sean Williams to play with composure for them to win the game.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 18 overs: UAE's spinners, Mohammad Tauqir and Nasir Aziz, bowled to the field that was set and picked up crucial wickets to give them a genuine chance of winning the game. Regis Chakabva, who struggled for timing was dismissed hit-wicket for a painstaking innings of 35.Time for drinks.

ZIMBABWE:17.1 Karate to Brendan Taylor, no run, good length ball on off, defended to the right of the bowlerKrishnachandran Karate, right-arm medium, comes into the attackIt was Raza, who eventually decided to break the shackles by looking to play shots. Initially, Raza struggled for timing before he essayed a couple of glorious boundaries off Javed's bowling. Raza used his feet to thwack a boundary over extra cover. It forced Javed to alter his length and bowl short. Raza duly took advantage of it with a sumptuous cut shot. Raza followed it up with a majestic pull shot off Naveed's bowling over backward square-leg for a six. It was Mohammad Tauqir, the off-spinner, who finally dismissed Raza for a stirring knock of 46. Javed then snared the wicket of Hamilton Masakadza.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: Mohammad Naveed and Amjad Javed bowled with zest and vigour to keep Zimbabwe's batsmen on their toes for a few overs. Naveed, with a whippy action, generated away-swing. Both the seamers also flicked their wrist to surprise Sikandar Raza and Regis Chakabva for a bit of pace. Javed even hit Raza on the head with a skiddy bouncer.

S Raza is on strike. Naveed will open the attackWelcome back.. UAE batsmen have done their job. Now upto their bowlers. If they can keep it tight and field well, then they can cause an upset. Can Zimbabwe chase this down? Or will they succumb to the pressure of chasing? We'll find out soon. The players make their way out to the middle. Raza will take strike first up. Naveed to start off proceedings. He has two slips in place...This is a good score for UAE. In fact, 285 is their highest ODI score as well. Their captain said at the toss that he would be happy with anything between 280-300 and his batsmen haven't let him down. Can UAE's bowlers defend the total and give them a winning start to their campaign? We'll find out after the break.For Zimbabwe, Chatara bowled a fine spell upfront. Solomon Mire, with a whippy action, hit the bat hard and troubled the batsmen. But their fielding wasn't up to the mark. It is an easy-paced track, but Zimbabwe need to bat well to overhaul the target set by a spirited UAE team. Khurram then, picked the length quickly and essayed fluent shots on both sides of the wicket to give UAE's innings the much-needed impetus. It took a smart catch by Sean Williams at backward point to send the dangerous Khurram back to the pavilion. Once Khurram was dismissed, the 35-year-old Anwar, known for his ability to play powerful shots in UAE's cricketing circles, gave a good account of himself with a crunching knock of 67. In particular, he took a heavy toll on Panyangara's bowling by clobbering him for a four and a six in the 40th over of the innings. Anwar was well-supported by Swapnil Patel. Krishnachandran Karate, Amjad Javed and Mohammad Naveed too played key knocks for UAE.On the back of Shaiman Anwar's pyrotechnics and Khurram Khan's superlative innings, UAE notched up a sizeable score on the board. Zimbabwe's bowlers, Tendai Chatara and Tinashe Panyangara started on a good note by bowling with good disciplines. However, Brendan Taylor, the wicket-keeper, dropped an easy chance to give Andri Berenger a reprieve off Chatara's bowling. Chatara again produced the edge off Berenger's bat, and Taylor completed the catch. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a no-ball. He was eventually rewarded for his perseverance with the wicket of Amjad Ali.4

Khurram is a free-flowing stroke-maker, who picks the length quickly. Krishnachandran Karate too looked in fine touch before he was dismissed by the impressive Solomon Mire. Khurram, after composing a fluent innings of 45, then lost his wicket on the back of a smart catch taken by Sean Williams at backward point.For Zimbabwe, Mire, with a whippy action, hit the bat hard and troubled the batsmen. On an easy-paced wicket, where the batsmen can play on the up and through the line, UAE need a sizeable total on the board to give Zimbabwe a run for their money.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES:17.1 Sean Williams to K Khan, no run, flat and close to off, Khan punches it towards the bowlerHere is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 17 overs: After Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bowl, Tendai Chatara bowled with purpose to produce the edge off Andri Berenger's bat, but Brendan Taylor, the wicket-keeper, grassed a straightforward chance. Chatara again forced Berenger to edge a delivery that shaped away from him and this time around, Taylor completed the catch. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a no ball.Chatara was finally rewarded for his persistence with the wicket of Amjad Ali. Solomon Mire then snaffled the wicket of Berenger. However, Khurram Khan, who averages a shade over 53 in ODIs showed his class by essaying a supreme cover-drive and followed it up with a crunching pull shot off the bowling of Mire.Time for some drinks!

He has a couple of slips to assist him..Zimbabwe have made one change from their previous game against South Africa. Regis Chakabva comes in place of Chamu Chibhabha. The national anthems of both teams are played out. There is plenty of support for Zimbabwe.Pitch Report: "This pitch is being used for the second time in a space of two days. There are some wear marks from the bowlers' followthrough in the last game, but in general it really still looks a good surface. There may be some moisture early on. We saw in the last game that it got better for batting as the game went on. The grass cover is nicely rolled. I think it should be a really good surface," says Shaun Pollock.Teams:United Arab Emirates (Playing XI): Amjad Ali, Andri Berenger, Krishnachandran Karate, Khurram Khan, Swapnil Patil(w), Shaiman Anwar, Rohan Mustafa, Amjad Javed, Mohammad Naveed, Mohammad Tauqir(c), Nasir AzizZimbabwe (Playing XI): Sikandar Raza, Regis Chakabva, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w), Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura(c), Solomon Mire, Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai Chatara, Tafadzwa KamungoziZimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldChigumbura: "We had a lot postivies from the last game and looking to bounce back in this game. We are going to bowl first. I think it's a good wicket to chase down a score, almost similar to the one in Hamilton. We would like to bat second as the pitch would get better to bat on later in the day. Hopefully, we can play good cricket today. We tried to work on the finishing bit, both with batting and bowling. So, hopefully we can finish well today."Tauqir: "It's a beautiful town, we have been here for 4-5 days and the weather is like back home. It looks like a good wicket to bat on and we would like to put up a decent total. In the last game between West Indies and Ireland, even 300 was not enough. Seems like a good wicket to bat on first, we are targeting anything between 280-300. We played Australia at MCG, so most of the nervousness has gone. We are looking forward to this game. We are injury-free, all ready to play and have fun in this game."Head to head: These two teams have never played against each other and this will be the first time they are meeting in ODIs. Who will come out on top? We'll find out in a few hours time. Don't go anywhere as the toss and teams are coming up in short while....UAEMeanwhile, UAE played two warm-up games and were beaten in both. They were a no match to the mighty Australians, who thrashed them by 188 runs, but they came close to beating Afghansitan in their second game. Chasing a target of 309, the most experienced batsman, Khurram Khan led from the front with a solid 86. The rest of the batters revolved around him, but it was not enough as they fell short by 14 runs.Skipper Mohammad Tauqir has said that they have set themselves a few goals going into the World Cup. One of the main targets being, beating one of the Test playing nations. With the group they are in, this game provides them the best opportunity to achieve that. If they play to their potential and are disciplined in the field, there is no reason why they can't beat Zimbabwe.ZimbabweThis will be Zimbabwe's second game of the tournament. Their first was against South Africa, where they put up a spirited fight. They were set a target of 340, most teams would have given up on the chase seeing the bowling attack the Proteas possessed, but not Zimbabwe. The Chamu Chibhabha-Hamilton Masakadza partnership gave them hope as the pair added 105 runs for the second wicket. Brendan Taylor, then came out with an attacking mindset to score a run-a-ball 40. They were well on course at 191/2 in 32.5 overs, but lost Masakadza and Taylor in quick succession. Those two wickets acted as a catalyst for South Africa, who then bowled them out for 277.Going by recent form, Masakadza is the their best batsman. He scored a brilliant hundred against Sri Lanka in the practise game and led his side to victory. The hard-hitting batsman was not finished there, he also scored a quickfire 80 versus South Africa. If only the other batsmen provide him the support, then they could be a dangerous side with the bat. The bowling looked sharp in the first half of the South Africa game, but could not handle pressure at the death. However, they should be able to do well against a team like UAE.Let us have a look at the recent form of these two teams.Most of the lesser known teams have been impressive so far in their display. Let it be Ireland, who beat West Indies, or Scotland and Zimbabwe, who almost scared New Zealand and South Africa respectively. UAE and Zimbabwe lock horns today in this Group B encounter. The former are playing their first World Cup game in almost 20 years. The latter, on the other hand, go into this encounter as favorites considering their recent form.Preview:Despite a spirited display in their opening match, Zimbabwe ended up on the losing side against South Africa and they will be eager to get their campaign back on track when they take on minnows United Arab Emirates. The team from UAE, making their second World Cup appearance since 1996, will be hoping to pull off some surprises but given Zimbabwe's current form, it will be a tough task for the Asian team.Venue: Saxton Oval, NelsonDate: February 19, 2015Time: 0330 Hrs ISTWeather: Mostly sunny with a high of 25 degreesTeam news:Zimbabwe:The Elton Chigumbura-led side, that came up with a fighting performance against South Africa, has warned UAE of no mercy with the skipper promising a "ruthless" approach. Zimbabwe had the Proteas in a spot at 83 for 4, only to see David Miller and JP Duminy put on an unbeaten 256-run stand to power South Africa to a total of 339 in 50 overs. In reply, Zimbabwe were in a pretty comfortable position at 191/2 before losing their last eight wickets for just 86 runs. Before their opening game, Zimbabwe had done well in the warm-ups as well - they left New Zealand in a lot of trouble before rain intervened, while they stunned Sri Lanka by chasing down 280.The bowlers, who had done a fine job in the first half of their innings against South Africa, came under the attack in the latter stages, with Miller and Duminy blasting 111 runs off the last six overs. Chamu Chibhabha and Hamilton Masakadza did well with the bat, as did Brendan Taylor to an extent, but the rest of the batters failed to come up with anything substantial which led to a 62-run loss. Zimbabwe will be hoping for their bowlers to deliver with a lot more discipline, while they will also expect their batters to show more application in their remaining matches.Going by skipper Chigumbura's words, Zimbabwe are unlikely to make any changes to their eleven. "Our team is quite balanced when it comes to batting and bowling, so it's just polishing up where it went wrong in the first game," he said.Probable XI: 1. Chamu Chibhabha, 2. Sikandar Raza, 3.

UAE will be looking to add to their only World Cup win, which came against the Netherlands in 1996. The Mohammad Tauqir-led side is taking inspiration from Ireland, who humbled West Indies in their first match of the showpiece event.UAE's team is a mix of expatriates and semi-professionals. Captain Tauqir, who is an investment banker himself, said Ireland's win is a huge boost to every minnow and his side will also be looking to pull off some giant-killing acts in the tournament. The Asian team has a mix of youth and experience with Tauqir (42 years) and leading batsman Khurram Khan (43 years) sharing the distinction of being the tournament's oldest players.In their practice match against Australia, UAE's lack of international experience was exposed by the hosts, who amassed 304 runs before skittling them out for 116. They fared a lot better against Afghanistan, running their Asian rivals close in a chase of 309 before ending up 15 runs short.Probable XI: 1. Amjad Ali, 2. Andri Berenger, 3. Krishna Chandran, 4. Khurram Khan, 5. Swapnil Patil (wk), 6. Shaiman Anwar, 7. Rohan Mustafa, 8. Mohammad Naveed, 9. Amjad Javed, 10. Mohammad Tauqir (capt), 11. Nasir Aziz.Watch out for:He scored 63 against Sri Lanka in the warm-up game while he got out on 40 against South Africa. Former Zimbabwe ODI skipper Brendan Taylor has been amongst the runs, but a big knock is due from him. UAE may well be the team that gets Taylor going in this tournament.The oldest player of this World Cup, Khurram Khan, was in superb form during the ODI series against Afghanistan in November-December 2014, amassing 270 runs in three matches including a hundred and two fifties. UAE will be hoping that the senior batsman replicates that form in the big event.Quotes:"You have to take every game seriously, do the basics right and make sure when you get into a good winning position you are ruthless and win the game."- Elton Chigumbura"It was a great win for Ireland. Most of the associate nations are doing well and we would like to prove a point also."- Mohammad TauqirStats:Elton Chigumbura needs three more wickets to reach the 100 ODI wickets milestone. Once he does that, he will become only the second Zimbabwe player after Grant Flower with the triple of 3000 or more runs, 100 or more wickets and 50 or more catches.LATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
