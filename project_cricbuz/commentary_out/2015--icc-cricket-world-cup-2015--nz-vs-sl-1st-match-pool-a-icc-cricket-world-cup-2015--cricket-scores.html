Are they checking for the back foot no-ball? Yes they are and Southee is fine. His heel was in the air and didn't land, cutting the side crease. Mathews charged Southee and top-edged the pull, as the ball got big on him, Vettori ran in from mid-on and took a good running catch.

SRI LANKA:40.1 Corey Anderson to Mathews, 1 run, slower delivery outside off, Mathews gets forward and drives to long-offJamie on Sri Lanka's summer in New Zealand - ?Heading into the final ten overs, Sri Lanka?s required rate is already past 12. New Zealand looking at two points with time to spare, unless Mathews can produce something special. It?s really all come down to how poorly Sri Lanka batted in these conditions.

There was no conclusive evidence to give that outUmpire Erasmus raised his finger, but Mathews wanted him to check if Ronchi had taken it cleanly. They have sent it upstairs. Milne is fine with the no-ball. First few replays suggest that the ball bounced on the finger of the gloves and went in. The TV umpire thinks it hit the ground, so he overturns the on-field decision

Umpire Erasmus didn't think there was an edge, but he got it wrong as Mendis got a feather on that. Top review from McCullum, who took the word of Ronchi. J Mendis c Ronchi b Milne 4(4) [4s-1]Milne to J Mendis, THATS OUT!! Caught!!New Zealand have reviewed a caught behind appeal. Milne is fine with the front foot.

D Karunaratne b Milne 14(21)Milne to D Karunaratne, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
SRI LANKA:31.2 Milne to Mathews, 1 run, good early call for the single and they make it easily. Mathews bunts this to the right of Guptill at point and shouts for the single
SRI LANKA:31.1 Milne to D Karunaratne, 1 run, drifts it onto Karunaratne's pads, clipped away to deep square legJamie with this now: " The asking rate is touching dangerous territory.

Umpire Erasmus raised his finger immediately. Boult is fine with the no-ball, it is a legal delivery. Sanga had a chat with Karunaratne and went for the review. There is no bat according to Snicko. The impact was umpires call and the ball is hitting the stumps. He is gone!

SRI LANKA:23.1 Boult to Sangakkara, no run, fuller and just outside off, Sangakkara drives it cover, straight to the fielderDimuth Karunaratne, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:22.6 Vettori to M Jayawardene, out Caught by Ronchi!! What an inspired bowling change by Baz. He brought in Vettori as soon as MJ walked out and the veteran has paid him with the wicket of Mahela. Jayawardene goes without troubling the scorers. He also walked and didn't wait for the umpire to raise his finger. It was fraction quicker than the previous deliveries, looked to steer it even though there was a slip, ends up nicking it to the keeper. Massive wicket for New Zealand.

This was a full delivery that angled in and shaped away at the last instant, Thirimanne plays down the wrong line, loses his off-pole in the process. A very important wicket for the Black Caps as Thiri looked in fine form. Thirimanne b Boult 65(60) [4s-8]Boult to Thirimanne, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
SRI LANKA:21.5 Boult to Thirimanne, 2 runs, good aggressive running. But a better throw would have made things interesting. Shortish and outside off, Thirimanne rides the bounce and cuts it wide of third man, Milne sends in a loopy throw. A flat throw would have had Thirimanne in trouble. He also dived to make his ground
SRI LANKA:21.4 Boult to Thirimanne, no run, fuller and outside off, Thirimanne opens the bat face and nails the drive straight to backward point. Either side and he would have picked up four

SRI LANKA:19.1 Boult to Sangakkara, FOUR, Sri Lanka might have shifted gears here. Sangakkara charges Boult and lofts it over mid-off, he just about eluded Baz's leap there. He tried to catch it with his right hand, but the ball was well over himOur man Jamie with this observation from the Hagley Oval: "Lahiru Thirimanne has carried Sri Lanka?s stiff chase to far with a fluent 43. Lots of nudges and dabs apart from one lovely cover drive off Adam Milne. That missed chance on 48 by Brendon McCullum at silly mid-on could hurt New Zealand. A good batting deck. Sri Lanka will need to keep wickets in tact for the back end of this innings."
SRI LANKA:18.6 Elliott to Thirimanne, FOUR, superb shot! Thirimanne spotted the slower one early, he went through with the shot, hit it through the line over mid-off. The ball bounces once before reaching the fence

SRI LANKA:17.2 Boult to Sangakkara, no run, fuller and close to off, Sangakkara pushes it to mid-off
SRI LANKA:17.1 Boult to Sangakkara, FOUR, how good was the timing on that? It just looked good for a couple, but the ball kept racing away. Full on middle and leg, Sangakkara leans forward and flicks it elegantly to the left of deep backward square, there was a fielder there but he could only watch the ball reach the fenceTrent Boult [4.0-0-27-0] is back into the attackIt is time for a drinks break! Sri Lanka have started well, the opening pair of Dilshan and Thirimanne added 67 runs, the latter doing most of the scoring. Sangakkara has looked at ease.

The slower delivery from Elliott, Thirimanne is deceived by the lack of pace, he checks his shot and ends up spooning it towards short mid-wicket. McCullum leaped up and got his left hand to it, but fails to hang on. He was a tad early in the jump, had he timed it better, he might have held onto it

SRI LANKA:0.1 Southee to Thirimanne, no run, Thirimanne gets a thick outside edge on the defensive, but it runs to ground quickly and it's stopped with a dive by point to his rightThirimanne and Dilshan are at the crease. Thirimanne is on strike. Southee will open the attackWelcome back for the reply. The 30 minutes has just flown by. Southee to start proceedings. Thirimanne and Dilshan are the batters. Here we go.Phew that was some stint of commentary. 50 overs of high-octane action. My fingers are bleeding - just kidding of course - after all the pounding. Time to take a break and hand over commentary duties to the trusted Akshay. He will take you through the initial stages of the run chase. Do hang around. Don't stray too far.Those supporting New Zealand, this stat might just make you even more optimistic. The Kiwis have not lost a game at home when they have scored above 300. They have won 14 and tied 1. So, can Sri Lanka end that run? Join us in a few minutes to find out...The Sri Lankan bowlers lost the plot at the start of the innings when McCullum and Guptill went berserk. Nonetheless, Mathews opted for spin and Herath answered his call. The left-arm spinner bowled superbly and dragged things back along with Lakmal. But Kulasekara and Malinga had forgettable days, even though the latter came back strongly towards the end, he still went for above 8 per over. The fielding too was mediocre as there were a couple easy chances that were put down. A couple of strikes from Jeevan Mendis put brakes on the scoring rate, but Anderson and Elliott added a crucial 65-run stand for the 5th wicket. The former went to register the third fifty of the innings. He smashed a 46-ball 75 to take his side past the 300-mark. His onslaught was such that, even the hard-hitting Ronchi played second fiddle to him.Once the game started it was the Brendon McCullum show. The Kiwi skipper hammered the first two balls he faced to the boundary. He set the tone for the innings. Guptill took his time to get his bearings right, but once settled, he joined in the fun. The opening pair added 111 and set up a fine platform. Williamson came in after the fall of B-Mac and was dropped straightaway by Sanga. The in-form New Zealand batsman made the most of the chance as he too got to his fifty. The first innings off the 2015 World Cup started amidst some drama. It was raining at the start of the day, but eased out for play to begin on time. However, rain returned once the national anthems were done and the players were about to take the field. It made sure that play started 5 minutes late.4

Herath comes back onInteresting thing about the Taylor dismissal: Sanga actually appealed for a caught behind first, he was sure that Taylor had got an outside edge before he completed the stumping. The umpires told him to go for the review, if he was so sure. Sri Lanka didn't go for it and opted for the umpire review on the stumping. Eventually it turned out to be a good decision

NEW ZEALAND:34.5 Dilshan to Elliott, 1 run, almost a mix-up!

Ross Taylor st Sangakkara b J Mendis 14(28)J Mendis to Ross Taylor, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!What has happened here? Drama at the Hagley Oval. Sanga appeals for both a caught behind and a stumping. Ross Taylor is gone! Sanga fumbled with the initial take, but recovered in time to effect the stumping. Superb stuff from Sri Lanka, fighting back. Third umpire taking a lot of looks. The Zing bails are off even before Taylor could get his back foot back. Taylor overbalanced and missed the drive. The ball is in Sanga's right hand and he dislodges the bails. OUT is the signal and the crowd go silent, the Kiwi section that is.Grant Elliott, right handed bat, comes to the creaseTimely strike for Sri Lanka just before the batting powerplay and that will be drinks as well
NEW ZEALAND:33.3 J Mendis to Williamson, out Caught by D Karunaratne!! Superb catch and Williamson is gone. Down the track and took it on the full, didn't hit it as well as he would've liked to, still it looked like that it would elude long-on, but Karuna ran to his right and dived to take it with both hands. He was airborne when he took it and the ball stuck when his elbows hit the ground. Mendis is a happy man and so are the Lankans.

Then he celebrated wildly

Hopefully, it's just a minor blip and we should get the game started.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Adam Milne, Trent BoultSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Dimuth Karunaratne, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Rangana Herath, Lasith MalingaSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to fieldAngelo Mathews: "It is nice to be here in New Zealand. All excited and ready to go. I will have a bowl as it is overcast and we are playing three seamers. The wicket looks fresh and we will look to exploit it. He (Dilshan) is alright and will be playing. Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Dushmantha Chameera and Sachithra Senanayake are not playing. You will never get used to this kind of weather, but that is not an excuse, you will just have to go there and play positive cricket."Brendon McCullum: "Yeah really excited to start the game at Christchurch. We would have bowled because of the overhead conditions. The wicket looks good. We have batted here in the past and have had some success. The guys are really excited getting into this World Cup and it is going to be a long campaign and it starts today. Some tough choices, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghan, Tom Latham and Nathan McCullum sit out today. It's a clean slate, we have had a fantastic preparation, we have played some outstanding cricket, had some personnel changes, but our gameplan remains the same. We have some confidence coming into the tournament, it is a clean slate. The tournament starts proper today, we will make sure that we execute our gameplan, if we do that, we will be hard to beat. But that doesn't guarantee you success either."Great news coming in from the Hagley Oval - the covers are off!Angelo Mathews reckons the past doesn't matter when he says this: "It is nice to have played a bit more cricket in New Zealand before the start of the World Cup, but from tomorrow onwards whoever plays the best cricket will go on to win."Some quotes ahead of the game. Here is Brendon McCullum with this about how his side will be tough to beat if they play well - "You go out there and give your best and I'm confident that if we give our best then we'll be tough to beat."Pre-match team news, Sri Lanka: One positive news for the Lankans ahead of the clash has been the declaration that Lasith Malinga is fit and will be available to play. It will be a battle between Karunaratne and Chandimal for the one middle-order spot. Jeevan Mendis and Rangana Herath are likely to be the two spinners.After that declaration, it's back to business. Pre-match team news - New Zealand: All 15 are fit and available. McCullum knows what is his final XI is but hinted that he may make necessary adjustments depending on the weather. Elliot will bat at 5 with Anderson at 7. Vettori will be the main spinner. Milne is expected to get the nod over McClenaghan.We don't want to brag or sound boastful here, but if you want the best coverage in terms of ball-by-ball content, then this is the place to come. We aspire and strive to give you the very best every ball, taking care not to miss a single piece of action. So since we have said it, you know where to head to each day of the World Cup. Needed to get that out of the closet!Not great news coming in from our man, Jamie Alter, here's his tweet: "Its 11 degrees at Hagley Oval. Cold, grey. Drizzle in the air. Not looking good"These two sides should know each other pretty well, having recently met in a seven match ODI series. So it will be interesting to see what sort of tactics we get to see in this match.There is an over-reliance on Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Angelo Mathews to get them the runs with the bat. While the bowling without Lasith Malinga doesn't pose any threats with due respect to the likes of Kulasekara, Eranga and the others. One good news will be the return of Lasith Malinga. If Malinga is back amongst the wickets and the runs are put on the board by the batters, then we may yet see a different Sri Lankan team.Sri Lanka on the other hand aren't going into the tournament as one of the favorites. The reason being their recent form hasn't been great. They were whitewashed by India away in a five match ODI series, also losing to New Zealand in the recently concluded ODI series. In between they defeated England at home 5-2 in a seven match series. But Sri Lanka at home are always a different proposition. So one shouldn't read too much into that series against England.The bowling will be spearheaded by the swing sensations in Tim Southee and Trent Boult with able backup from the experienced Kyle Mills - who may find it difficult to get into the eleven, with the wily old fox Daniel Vettori weaving his magic. They are led by a brilliant strategist in Brendon McCullum and lots of experts including Martin Crowe think that this is their best chance to emerge triumphant after six semi-final appearances. Will they do it remains the big question though.Just to let everyone know that they will take some stopping, they crushed South Africa by 134 runs in a warm-up game. The runs are flowing from the bats of Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum and down the order they have the dangerous Luke Ronchi and Corey Anderson.Why are New Zealand hot favorites? This is why. Their last three ODI series have gone like this - they beat Pakistan in the middle east 3-2 in a five match series. Then they thumped Sri Lanka 4-2 at home in a seven match series, before rounding off their World Cup preparations by defeating Pakistan 2-0 in a two match series at home.Now onto the main action and that is involving New Zealand and Sri Lanka. New Zealand are the form team going into the World Cup and look in great shape at the moment. Their side is led by the inventive and swashbuckling Brendon McCullum and they possess enough firepower in their ranks to go all the way. They missed out in 92 when they looked set to win, but it won't be a surprise at all if they go the whole distance this time.A massive crowd had turned up for the opening ceremony and it brought smiles on people's faces which was good to see. The residents of Christchurch needed this after all the heartache suffered in recent times.It was a disaster that forever changed the lives of Christchurchians and slowly, but surely they are getting things back on track. So it was fitting in a way that the opening ceremony and the first game of the World Cup has been given to Christchurch. Gavin Larsen, the former New Zealand seamer put it perfectly at the opening ceremony when he remarked - "This is really important for Christchurch, the people really need something like this after the earthquake. It's just fantastic."For the uninitiated, Christchurch was hit by a devastating earthquake in 2011. 22nd February 2011, a 6.3 magnitude aftershock of an earlier earthquake that occurred in September 2010 caused a disastrous disruption to Christchurch. There were nearly 200 fatalities and 10,000 injuries. Losses are estimated to be in the vicinity of 40 billion dollars.So enough build-up given? I think so. Let's move on and shift our attention to today's game between New Zealand and Sri Lanka set to be played at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch. It's very important for me to mention about the resilience of Christchurchians. Resilience? Why you may ask?Sachin Tendulkar. Jacques Kallis. Ricky Ponting. Muttiah Muralitharan. Kevin Pietersen. Some of the biggest stars to have played the game. Marquee names. Household names. Crowd pullers. Heroes. Role models. Unfortunately, we won't get to see them in action anymore as they have either retired/not picked. Their time is up. Time for new stars like Virat Kohli, Kane Williamson, David Warner and the rest to make a name for themselves. Who knows, the 2015 edition may throw up a new hero or an established star may make his career-defining performance.As I said previously, there are so many wonderful past memories from World Cups gone by, that it will take me the entire day today and more to relive all of them. Just reminiscing about all the moments brings out pleasant and often unforgettable moments. Every player knows that for him to be recognised, he has to show off his skills to the entire world on the grandest stage of them all.The World Cup is the stage for some of the greatest performers to strut their performances. And invariably, the champions pull off their best acts on the biggest stage of them all. From Clive Lloyd to IVA Richards to Kapil Dev to Wasim Akram to Aravinda de Silva to Shane Warne to Ricky Ponting to Glenn McGrath to MS Dhoni - the World Cup has seen them produce their defining work.The tournament will be played over a duration of 44 days with the final scheduled to be taking place on the 29th of March at the 'G'. There will be many nerve-wracking, heart-stopping, exciting, thrilling - and all the other adjectives you can possible think of - memories that will be served up during the course of the tournament. Yes, there will be the comical, the utterly ridiculous, the controversial, the odd fight here and there thrown in as well. So in short - expect the unexpected and some more!Hello and a warm welcome to wherever you are in any corner of the planet. The 2015 ICC World Cup is about to start off with a game between New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Before I go on about the respective sides' recent form, let me throw some more light on the 2015 tournament.So many moments. I could go on and on and on. It's time for the biggest prize in world cricket - the carnival as they call it, to begin. Yes it's World Cup time again, folks! The 2015 World Cup is here and we are just warming ourselves up for what should be a celebration of the great game.

Zimbabwe beat Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka lost to South Africa. South Africa lost to New Zealand. Whatever significance has already been attached to these three results in Lincoln and Christchurch this week - Kyle Abbott termed it "amazing" to watch South Africa scrap to a narrow win, JP Duminy said they "weren't fazed" by defeat - is likely to evaporate come February 14 when the 2015 ICC World Cup begins at Hagley Park. The nature of the warm-up game is such that teams tend not to take them too seriously, with the option of fielding all 15 players. But history has shown us that you really cannot read too much into them. In a 2007 World Cup warm-up, India bowled out West Indies for 85 and we all know how that tournament turned out for them.Game one of the World Cup features the hosts New Zealand, riding a high over the last year and coming off a 134-run hammering of South Africa at the very venue for Saturday, the scenic Hagley Oval, facing Sri Lanka - finalists in the last two World Cups. Two teams with good World Cup records, and who know each other pretty well. Sri Lanka have been stationed in the country for about seven weeks, and would have a good sense of the conditions. New Zealand, skippered by Brendon McCullum, are being talked up as title contenders after their best-ever Test year and with ODI series wins over India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.On Friday, a day before the World Cup opener in Christchurch, McCullum was asked once again about the added pressure of captaining one of the favourites, who are in excellent form, in front of the home fans. This is a massive game not only for the home team but for the host city, which remains in parts devastated from the aftermath of the tragic 2011 earthquakes. Whoever you ask, the theme of Christchurch's sporting fans needing reason to cheer has been resonant. "I've got a job to do and its all-encompassing in terms of captaincy, opening the batting and trying to execute the strategies on the field. Is there extra pressure? I guess it is there on everyone," he said. "Just because the nature of it being a World Cup, I'm excited about it and I have high ambitions as to what I want to achieve. Whether you achieve them or not is another thing, but I go in feeling reasonably confident and secure in the fact that I'm surrounded by guys who I trust and believe in."Belief. It's a word that has in a sense epitomised New Zealand's surge as a team over in the year leading up to the World Cup. Against India, a team that has regularly bossed them in ODIs in recent years, they won 4-0 last January. Then a Test series win in the West Indies, a 2-0 ODI loss at home to South Africa, before a come-from-behind Test draw against Pakistan in the UAE. In the subsequent ODIs, New Zealand won 3-2. Sri Lanka landed in the country and were beaten in the Tests and ODIs, then Pakistan handed a 2-0 ODI series loss. How do you not believe that this is a team who believes in itself?"When you go into a tournament as underdogs, dark horses or favourites, it is all irrelevant once the games start," reckoned McCullum. "It's great because it drums up energy and anticipation and expectation, but once the game actually starts it is back to the contest in its purest form - which is bat and ball and someone wins and someone loses. So that is the mentality we've got and we know what works for us. That is all we can focus, not on how some people have an expectation from us and how some people are writing us off. It is irrelevant from our point of view. We know what we need to do to succeed and if someone else is good enough to beat us, then so be it."Sri Lanka are also riding on belief, their captain Angelo Mathews insisted while he spoke of what the team has learnt from their time in the country. "It is nice to have played a bit more cricket in New Zealand before the start of the World Cup, but from tomorrow onwards whoever plays the best cricket will go on to win," he said. "I think we have a slight advantage. We got used to the conditions, we have a fair idea of what the wickets are like, but we've got to be aggressive and play good cricket to win against New Zealand. They are on a roll, they've been winning plenty of games in the recent past, so we need to back our strengths and be positive."Sri Lanka have not zeroed in on their playing XI for Saturday's match, but Mathews confirmed that Lasith Malinga would play. His addition gives the team its bowling spearhead, a sling-arm fast bowler with 271 ODI wickets and the experience of two World Cups, during which he left an impression on both occasions. The significance of Malinga's return - he has taken 29 wickets against New Zealand in 21 ODIs - was not lost on McCullum."He's a world-class bowler who makes a significant difference to their bowling line-up," he said. "Predominantly at the back end of the game. He's a phenomenal death bowler, a factor which we have to overcome if we're going to succeed in this game. If we can head into those final overs with a nice platform, and if we've ticked off some of our key ingredients along the way, then hopefully we can put him under a little bit of pressure. Certainly Sri Lanka is a stronger team for Lasith Malinga's involvement."If the conditions at Hagley Park over the two warm-up matches here this week are any indication, the surface will encourage batting and bowling. On Monday, Sri Lanka got to 279 for 7 in 44.4 overs and asked tough questions of South Africa who stumbled to a D/L revised target of 188 with three balls and five wickets remaining. Sri Lanka's innings contained a cut-and-pull-fuelled century off 82 balls by Tillakaratne Dilshan. On Wednesday, New Zealand racked up 331 for 8 in 50 overs and then bowled out South Africa for 197 in 44.2, with Boult and Tim Southee's early strikes effectively ending the match as a contest before Duminy and Vernon Philander produced gritty fifties.Having played two one-day matches here on tour - an ODI in January and Monday's warm-up against South Africa - Mathews knew the nature of the surface. "It depends on the weather, but the wicket looks really good. There will be a lot of runs," he said. "If it is a good wicket, we will try and bat first. We've got the bowlers to stop the opposition and if we have to bowl first, we've got the experience in our batting [to chase]. So it doesn't really matter for us. As long as we play good cricket, our brand of cricket, we will be able to win."McCullum echoed Mathews' views. "[The pitch] looks good, looks like it's got a bit of bounce and should be an even cricket wicket," he said. "That's what you want in a World Cup, a pitch that has a bit for both parties. We're going to have an even surface on which the team that plays the best cricket will come out on top. It's a good wicket that's been prepared."Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Sachithra Senanayake, Suranga Lakmal, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dushmantha ChameeraNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Adam Milne, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, Kyle Mills, Nathan McCullum, Tom LathamLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
