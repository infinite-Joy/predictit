Joyce drove this over the in-field on the off-side, the ball slowed near the boundary ropes. Joyce thought that the ball had reached the boundary. After completing the third run, he stood half-way down the pitch, the fielder fired the throw to the non-striker's end and the bails were taken off. Umpires conferred and adjudged Joyce OUT.

Dawlat Zadran will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Dawlat Zadran to start the proceedings. Two slips in place. Here we go then..Despite being reduced to 109/6, Afghanistan did well to reach a decent total. Thanks to fifties from Mohammad Nabi and Rashid Khan who both played with purpose and panache. Rashid Khan, in particular was aggressive in the slog overs which eventually helped Afghanistan recover after the untimely dismissal of Nabi. Rahmat Shah was the only batsmen in the top 6 who made a notable contribution by notching up 48 off 70 balls. Ireland bowling and fielding was top-class up until 35th over. A few drop chances, however, towards the end cost them dear and might as well come back to haunt them. Be back for the chase in a while....4

AFGHANISTAN:20.4 Andy McBrine to Stanikzai, out Caught by Ed Joyce!! That's a terrific grab from Ed joyce at deep mid-wicket. Greyhounds down the pitch and goes through with the mow over mid-wicket. Only succeeds in getting more elevation than distance. To be honest, it looked like a six for a fleeting movement.

Here we go then..Ireland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Ed Joyce, Sean Terry, Stuart Poynter(w), Kevin O'Brien, Paul Stirling, Gary Wilson, Andy McBrine, Barry McCarthy, Tim Murtagh, Peter ChaseAfghanistan have won the toss and have opted to batThe sky is a deep blue, the pitch a creamy beige, the outfield a lush green. Looking splendid. Hello and welcome to the fourth encounter of this 5-match series. After outplaying Ireland in the second ODI, Afghanistan lost the plot and succumbed in the third game to give Ireland a shot at levelling the series. It is difficult to predict who is the favorite today, but the way hosts have played in the last ODI, they definitely have the momentum on their side. Besides Shahzad, Nabi has been the only player who has contributed to Afghanistan's cause in the series so far, which will be a concern for the team management. The contest has been even so far in the series and the order won't change as this promises to be an enthralling affair. Stay tuned for the toss and team update...Teams:Ireland (From): William Porterfield(c), Ed Joyce, Sean Terry, Stuart Poynter(w), Kevin O'Brien, Paul Stirling, Gary Wilson, Andy McBrine, Barry McCarthy, Tim Murtagh, Peter Chase, Mark Richard Adair, John Anderson, Tyrone Kane, George DockrellAfghanistan (From): Mohammad Shahzad(w), Javed Ahmadi, Rahmat Shah, Samiullah Shenwari, Asghar Stanikzai(c), Najibullah Zadran, Mohammad Nabi, Mirwais Ashraf, Rashid Khan, Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor Zadran, Amir Hamza, Yamin Ahmadzai, Noor Ali Zadran, Gulbadin NaibLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
