ZIMBABWE:48.3 48.3J Mooney to C Ervine, FOUR. There you go! The winning runs and Ervine gets to his hundred as well. Zimbabwe win the series with one game to go. Fittingly, Ervine finishes off in style and in the process, he registered his second ODI ton. Coming to the delivery, it was a length ball, Ervine steps out and flat-bats the loft over the bowler's head. He has his arms aloft and acknowledges the grand applause from the crowd. The skipper hugs him and pats him on the back - what a terrific knock this has been from Ervine!

ZIMBABWE:46.3 J Mooney to S Raza, out Caught by Ed Joyce!! Raza has to trudge back and he is not happy with himself. He would have liked to finish the innings off in style but he has holed out in the deep. He was looking to clear deep mid-wicket with a powerful whack on the leg-side, the timing wasn't perfect though - Ed Joyce steadies himself near the rope and accepts the chance gleefully.

ZIMBABWE:46.2 J Mooney to S Raza, FOUR, wow! That's a lovely-looking stroke from Raza and he seems to have middled that to perfection. Makes room to this good length delivery and goes for the inside-out loft over extra cover, once it cleared the fielder it was always going to be a boundary
ZIMBABWE:46.1 J Mooney to C Ervine, 1 run, full and in the outside off zone, Ervine steps out and slices the drive over cover, sweeper comes in quickly but the ball lands well in front of him. He adjusts and does well to stop the boundaryJohn Mooney [7.0-0-32-0] is back into the attack

ZIMBABWE:41.2 Murtagh to C Ervine, FOUR, this should make things easy for Zimbabwe. They just need to put tha bad balls away and Ervine has just done that. Short and into the batsman, Ervine middles the pull and places it behind square on the leg-side. Much-needed boundary for the hosts

ZIMBABWE:39.6 J Mooney to S Raza, 1 run, Zimbabwe are taking too many risks here and this time it's Raza who nearly threw his wicket away. He drives this crisply towards mid-off and calls for a quick single, the fielder has a shy at the bowler's end and misses. Had that hit Raza, he was out by a long way

ZIMBABWE:37.5 J Mooney to C Ervine, no run, Mooney is disappointed as Ervine gets a reprieve. This was dropped by Niall O' Brien behind the stumps, but it was a very difficult chance.

ZIMBABWE:37.2 J Mooney to S Raza, 1 run, risky but Raza was safe in the end. This was absolutely unnecessary from the Zimbabwean batsmen. This length delivery was dabbed towards point, Ervine was rushing in for a quick single and forced Raza to take off. The fielder from point gets across to the ball quickly, Raza had to sprint so hard and in the process he rips the stumps off at the bowler's end (with a desparate dive to make his ground)
ZIMBABWE:37.1 J Mooney to C Ervine, 1 run, full and angling into the batsmen, Ervine clips it through mid-wicket for an easy single

ZIMBABWE:36.2 K O'Brien to Mutombodzi, out Caught by Dockrell!! There you go - the much-needed breakthrough for Ireland. This was a good length delivery on off, Mutombodzi looks to whip it in the air and over mid-wicket, was early in doing so. He gets a leading edge, which for a fleeting moment, appeared to be landing safely, but Dockrell rushes forward from cover, dives full length and grabs a good low catch just inches from the ground. Brilliant effort by the spinner. Mutombodzi c Dockrell b K O'Brien 25(31) [4s-1]K O'Brien to Mutombodzi, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ZIMBABWE:35.1 J Mooney to C Ervine, no run, oh! What is happening out there? Mooney goes for a celebratory run down the pitch assuming the batsman is out, but the umpire is unmoved. Pitched on a good length and just outside off, Ervine pokes at it, there seems to be some deflection as the ball passed the bat but one cannot be sure. Niall O' Brien after a fumble on the first attempt, manages to grab it on the second attempt - but all that goes in vainJohn Mooney [4.0-0-21-0] is back into the attackErvine seems to have some problem with his hamstring and is being treated by the physio. It's a hot day and Zimbabwe, at the current moment, are in the driver's seat. Can Ireland pull off something incredible to square the series? Meanwhile, Mooney is back ...Drinks are on the field now
ZIMBABWE:34.6 K O'Brien to Mutombodzi, leg byes, 2 runs, curving in from a length, Mutombodzi looks to send it out of the stadium. Misses and is knocked on the pad, but he was well outside leg though. Ball rolls away fine and the batsmen collect two leg byes
