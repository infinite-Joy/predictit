Can Anderson and Co. restrict the Sri Lankan batsmen? Thirimanne and Dilshan are out in the centre. Anderson with the new ball. He has a couple of slips to assist him...Not much to be said about the Sri Lankan bowling. Lakmal was unlucky as there were a couple of catches were dropped off his bowling in his second over. Malinga still doesn't look like his old self. Herath was used sparingly, Mathews and Dilshan were economical and were the best bowlers on display for Sri Lanka. The fielding at the start of the innings was very poor, they dropped as many as three catches. Nonetheless, it is now upto their batsmen to chase this down. Can they register their third consecutive win? Or will England win their second game of the World Cup? Join us in a short while to find out....However, Root kept the scoreboard ticking at one end. He knocked the ball around and pounced on anything that was loose. Once he got to his 4th ODI hundred, he changed gears and thrashed Thisara Perera - carving him for 18 runs in his 8th over.

Morgan looked good but he also threw away the start he got.4

It was fuller and around off, Bell looks to drive, the ball shapes in just a touch, gets an inside edge onto the pad and then the ball crashes into the stumps. Bell shakes his head in disappointment. Bell b Lakmal 49(54) [4s-7]Lakmal to Bell, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Sri Lanka have pulled things back ever since Moeen Ali departed and Ballance followed him soon after too. Sri Lanka though have been poor on the field. We are just 17 overs in and they have already dropped three chances today. The fielders need to do better if they want to restrict England.

Fullish and outside off, he reaches out for it and drives it in the air to mid-off, Lakmal hangs to a dolly. Actually, Moeen was trying to hit it over the fielder, but was not able to get the elevation. An important wicket for Sri Lanka.

They slowly stride out to the middle. Malinga marks his run-up. Moeen Ali will take strike first up. The countdown begins. The umpire says play and here we go..Pitch Report: "It looks like a very good surface. It is exactly the same pitch that England played New Zealand on about a week go. Quite a bit of grass rolled into the surface. It feels quite firm. The average score here is 215. It will be a good even contest between bat and ball," reckons Michael Atherton.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Dimuth Karunaratne, Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Suranga LakmalEngland (Playing XI): Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, James AndersonEngland have won the toss and have opted to batMathews: "We have been playing really good cricket against them and in the last two games. So, hopefully, we can repeat the same performance again. I would have batted first as well. The wicket might assist the fast bowlers a little bit in the first 10-15 overs. So, we will look to exploit that early on. They are all fit. We played some good cricket in the last game. So, hopefully we can continue. You got to peak at the right time and hopefully, we can peak from here onwards."Morgan: "The last game we played here was a little bit of a disaster. Again, looking to rectify and build on our performance against Scotland here today. We have played a lot of cricket here before and the last game we played, we learned something about the ground, it swung a little bit and the wicket played a little differently than we expected. We are going to have a bat. Again, it's similar to the other day. Looked a really good wicket and the sun is out. Again, if it does swing, that will be no surprise to us. Hopefully, we will bat better. We are unchanged today. We have been out of our tracks little bit late, but hopefully, the Scotland game will give us a little bit of momentum for our performance today and we are all looking to win a game of cricket today."Head-to-Head: England and Sri Lanka have played each other 9 times in World Cups, with the former winning 6 of those games. However, off late it is the Islanders, who have had the better of them, winning the last 2 matches in 2007 and 2011.EnglandMoeen Ali was outstanding in the game against Scotland. The southpaw scored a superb hundred and gave the foundation to set a massive score. The middle-order, however, did not capitalize and could only manage to scrape past 300. Nonetheless, the bowlers did not disappoint. Steven Finn put the horrors of McCullum's bashing to rest with a terrific display. He scalped 3 wickets and was the pick of the bowlers. England might bring in Ravi Bopara for Gary Ballance, who has not fired in all the three matches that he has played in the World Cup.England return to Wellington, the same place where they were blown away by Tim Southee. But, according to Chris Woakes they have put that behind them. And they must as this is a very important game for them. Having lost their first two games to Australia and New Zealand, England managed to register their first win in the competition against Scotland. So, if they lose this, then they will make it more difficult for themselves to qualify for the quarter-finals.Sri LankaThe problematic areas for them is the over dependancy on the big three - Dilshan, Sangakkara and Mahela. As it can be seen, in the two wins that they have registered, these three veterans have played crucial roles. Thirimanne, Mathews and Karunaratne have all got starts, but have not converted them into big scores and that is where experience comes in. Malinga is slowly getting back to his best and that was evident in the game against Bangladesh. Herath has done the holding job to perfection, but they need him to take wickets as well. One bowler who has been consistent is Suranga Lakmal. The tall fast bowler has hit the deck hard and troubled the batsmen. However, they need all of them to fire in unison.Sri Lanka have been inconsistent. Though they have registered two back-to-back wins, they still have areas of concern. After being outplayed in their first game against New Zealand, the Islanders managed to claw their way past a spirited Afghanistan, thanks to a brilliant ton from Mahela Jayawardene and some late order hitting from Thisara Perera. The most convincing win came against Bangladesh in their last game. Dilshan and Sangakkara notched up hundreds, set a mammoth target and then the bowlers restricted the opposition quite comfortably.These two countries have played each other a lot in the recent past. With 8 wins out of 12 games last year, Sri Lanka hold the upper hand in their head-to-head meetings recently. But, that might count to nothing as this is the World Cup and this is the stage where it matters the most. Let us have a look as to how both teams have fared so far in the tournament.The World Cup just got spicier the last couple of days. There were some close fought contests. And we also witnessed one of the best games of the tournament so far. The New Zealand-Australia game had everything in it and in the end it was the Kiwis, who prevailed in a nail-biting finish. Today, we travel back towards Wellington, where England take on Sri Lanka. A crucial match for both teams as we enter the second phase of the group stage.Preview:England are back in Wellington, where on February 20 they were bowled out for 123 in 33.2 overs and lost to New Zealand by eight wickets with 226 balls remaining. That defeat equaled their heaviest defeat in terms of balls remaining, and against Sri Lanka at the Westpac Stadium on Sunday they will be looking to be much, much better than their last trip here.Chris Woakes, the fast bowler who emerged from Brendon McCullum's assault with exemplary figures of 3-1-8-2 on that dismal day last Friday, chose not to dwell on any possible trepidation of England's return to the 'Cake Tin' and instead said this World Cup fixture was an opportunity to go back and right a wrong."I think we've got a good opportunity to turn things around really," he told reporters ahead of a training session at the Basin Reserve at the other and of Wellington. "Obviously, last time we were there it didn't exactly go to plan. It's hard to read too much into that game, I suppose. We were pretty poor. We obviously didn't get a total on the board, and Tim Southee bowled exceptionally well, as well. Hopefully we're past that now and can put that behind us, but it would be good to get back there and show people what we can do. I think it's a good opportunity for us to put that completely behind us, and as I said before, show people what we can do and put in a solid performance."To be better, England will need to bat better. In their last match, against Scotland in Christchurch, they were 172 for 1 in 30.1 overs and ended up with 303 for 8. After Ian Bell and Moeen Ali departed, Gary Ballance , Joe Root and James Taylor fell cheaply and skipper Eoin Morgan was far from fluent during his 42-ball 46. It is likely that Ballance will lose his place at No 3, with Ravi Bopara fitting back into the batting order.These two teams know a lot about each other, having played 12 ODIs in the last 12 months. Sri Lanka won eight of those in the course of series wins home and away, and so England know what their challenges are. During their 5-2 defeat in Sri Lanka, England often competed in spurts and struggled against spin overall, with only Root really showing a masterly grip of how to score off Sri Lanka's slow bowlers. While spin is not expected to play a big factor in Wellington - after Daniel Vettori's 20 wickets in 20 ODIs here, the next most successful spinner is Jeetan Patel with seven - England will need to be wary of the threat in Sri Lanka's ranks.With Jeevan Mendis ruled out of the World Cup due to injury, the spinning responsibility has increased on veteran Rangana Herath, and Sri Lanka coach Marvan Atapattu hinted at playing the offspinner Sachithra Senanayake who has 14 wickets in seven ODIs against England at an average of 14.57 and economy of 3.73. Herath, 36, has featured in each of Sri Lanka's World Cup games so far, taking two wickets while playing a holding role and Atapattu felt he was doing well. "Rangana has been good, but it's different conditions for him," he said. "Obviously the ball hasn't turned as much as it does, but having said that, our seven match series against New Zealand, he was a big factor when we won, the two games that we won, so on the day, on the wicket, conditions may change."Sri Lanka have bounced back from defeat in the tournament opener in Christchurch on Valentine's Day, winning against Afghanistan and Bangladesh to currently occupy second place in the Pool A points table. While the Afghanistan win took some doing - they won with four wickets and ten balls in hand - there was enough for Atapattu to believe the team was ready for tougher examinations."Certainly, the last two games have been good for us, although we came very close it was a very close game against Afghanistan," he said. "Having said that, we would expect our No 8 to score the way he scored in the Dunedin game. Yes, we would like to take game by game at this stage. We know in World Cups every game is important, and peaking at the right time is the most important thing. We as a group believe in that, and we think game by game, and hopefully we have a good result tomorrow."Sri Lanka did not train at the Basin Reserve today owing to what Atapattu termed "a tough day" of travelling from Melbourne, and players were allowed much-needed downtime. Several of them took to the streets of Wellington, with Lahiru Thirimanne enjoying a leisurely stroll of the city's central business district on his own. England trained under a harsh sun, following two days of what Woakes termed as "hard practice", undoubtedly seeking to get their World Cup campaign on track. The forecast for Sunday is warm, but Wellington's notorious wind can be expected to play a factor.Probable XIsEngland: 1 Ian Bell, 2 Moeen Ali, 3 James Taylor, 4 Joe Root, 5 Eoin Morgan (capt), 6 Ravi Bopara, 7 Jos Buttler (wk), 8 Stuart Broad, 9 Chris Woakes, 10 James Anderson, 11 Steven FinnSri Lanka: 1 Lahiru Thirimanne, 2 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Dimuth Karunaratne, 6 Angelo Mathews (capt), 7 Dinesh Chandimal/Sachithra Senanayake, 8 Thisara Perera, 9 Rangana Herath, 10 Lasith Malinga, 11 Suranga LakmalTeams:Sri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Dimuth Karunaratne, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Suranga Lakmal, Upul Tharanga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Dushmantha ChameeraEngland (From): Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, James Anderson, Ravi Bopara, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, James TredwellLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
