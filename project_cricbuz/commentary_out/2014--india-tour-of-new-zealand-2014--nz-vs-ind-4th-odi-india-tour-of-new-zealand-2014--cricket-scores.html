NEW ZEALAND:48.1 48.1Aaron to Brendon McCullum, SIX, that's the match and the series! Fittingly it is the Kiwi skipper - Brendon McCullum who seals it, with a lofted drive over mid-off. The white ball sails over the fence. No-one in the crowd caught it as well. Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor hug each other and that's a job well done.Varun Aaron [6.0-0-45-1] is back into the attack
NEW ZEALAND:47.6 Shami to Ross Taylor, no run, back of a length on the stumps, Ross Taylor defends calmly
NEW ZEALAND:47.5 Shami to Brendon McCullum, 1 run, Jadeja has pushed the ball out of Rayudu's hands! Catch dropped! Awful fielding from India after a pretty ordinary stroke from Brendon McCullum - who charged and skied the lofted hit. The ball went miles up, Jadeja and Rayudu both came to catch it - no calling whatsoever, Rayudu caught it, but Jadeja collided with him, which meant that the ball popped out. Then after the ball goes to ground, they both involve in blamegames. Horrible to see professional cricketers fielding like this. McCullum just shrugs his shoulders and tells Ross Taylor to get on with it.
NEW ZEALAND:47.4 Shami to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, Aaron has had a nightmare in the field today. This is the 2nd boundary he has conceded through his legs. Should have been just a single, but he fails to bend properly and gives away three extra runs. New Zealand coasting here
NEW ZEALAND:47.4 Shami to Brendon McCullum, wide, now Shami sprays one well outside leg. Wide called
NEW ZEALAND:47.3 Shami to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, Brendon McCullum has decided he doesn't want to take it to the final over. Charges Shami and takes it on the full, gives himself some room and drives past mid-off, inside the ring. Some glove love between the two batsmen as well

NEW ZEALAND:45.3 Bhuvneshwar to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, Ashwin at third man is always a liability, with his movement. This delivery proves the same. Cut away just to his right, he ran and then dived, but the ball had beaten him to the ropes by then. New Zealand cruising along
NEW ZEALAND:45.2 Bhuvneshwar to Ross Taylor, 1 run, short of length outside off, punched wide of cover, for an easy single

NEW ZEALAND:44.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Ross Taylor, no run, beauty! Angling in to off, then as Ross Taylor came forward to defend, the ball spun away past the outside edge, periliously close to the off stump as well. Dhoni had the bails off, but Taylor had his back foot grounded

NEW ZEALAND:44.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Ross Taylor, no run, stretches forward and defends to cover

NEW ZEALAND:42.6 Aaron to Ross Taylor, FOUR, 9th ODI hundred for Ross Taylor and he sticks his tongue out. Has a smile on his face too. The crowd and the Kiwi team management stand up and applaud. A super shot to get there - a rasping cut over point. Removes the helmet and soaks in the applause from his home crowd. Poor bowling though from Aaron it must be said. He has been guilty of bowling far too short and wide outside off. Good players like Taylor won't miss out too often
NEW ZEALAND:42.5 Aaron to Brendon McCullum, 1 run, drives to mid-off, takes on the fielder and makes it. No direct hit as well, even if there was one, Brendon McCullum would've made it

NEW ZEALAND:41.5 Bhuvneshwar to Brendon McCullum, SIX, Gee! Doesn't matter whether Mahendra Singh Dhoni is up to the stumps. Brendon McCullum comes down the track and then flays the length ball, flat over the ropes at sweeper cover. That didn't travel very high at all, a real skimmer

NEW ZEALAND:39.6 Bhuvneshwar to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, Bhuvneshwar is cursing himself for bowling a delivery which gives enough width for Brendon McCullum to free his arms and lace the square drive past the infield. Spoils what would've been a fine maiden over. Pressure is released as well

India got Williamson just at the right time, but that has brought the dangerous Kiwi skipper, Brendon McCullum to the crease.

NEW ZEALAND:36.5 Shami to Brendon McCullum, 1 run, Shami got a hand to that checked drive, but it would be harsh to call that a dropped chance. Hit hard and the ball was travelling, Shami extended his left-hand, but it didn't stick. Good stop by Jadeja at mid-off too

Dhoni was shouting, 'easy, easy' to Kohli even as he was going to field the ball, the youngster fires a wild throw and Rohit Sharma couldn't back it up. Rohit should've dived, but that doesn't take away from the atrocious fielding from Kohli, when there was no chance of a run-out. Dhoni and Ashwin aren't impressed at all.

This double-blow brings India right back into the contest. Guptill lbw b Shami 35(27) [4s-6 6s-1]Shami to Guptill, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Mohammed Shami [3.0-0-26-0] is back into the attack

Short of a length angling away from the left hander, Ryder looks to drive off the back foot with no feet movement, this time an inside edge goes back onto the stumps. Aaron is delighted and so is the India contingent in the crowd as the leg pole is disturbed. Ryder b Aaron 19(18) [4s-4]Aaron to Ryder, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

NEW ZEALAND:2.1 Bhuvneshwar to Guptill, FOUR, probably something that the Indian openers can learn from these two. If the ball is there to be hit, they put it away with no half-measures. Short and wide outside off stump, Guptill cuts fiercely to the sweeper cover fence
NEW ZEALAND:1.6 Shami to Ryder, no run, a sharp 139 kph bouncer to end the over, Ryder sits under it comfortably
NEW ZEALAND:1.5 Shami to Ryder, FOUR, can't bowl there to this man, especially in the powerplay. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, Ryder flicks it very square through backward square leg and fine leg had no chance whatsoever
NEW ZEALAND:1.4 Shami to Ryder, FOUR, New Zealand are getting some handy boundaries behind the stumps, another one at fine leg now. Short of a length delivery down the leg side, Ryder flicks it, the fielder in the deep slides and tries to stop it with his legs but doesn't succeed

NEW ZEALAND:0.3 Bhuvneshwar to Guptill, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Guptill defends off the back foot
NEW ZEALAND:0.2 Bhuvneshwar to Guptill, FOUR, after a fine effort last delivery, this time Aaron makes a mess of a diving stop, which was a regulation one and allows it through his legs. A one has turned out to be a boundary after Guptill bottom-edged a cut
NEW ZEALAND:0.1 Bhuvneshwar to Guptill, no run, brilliant stop by Rayudu at cover, flinging to his left to cut off a certain boundary. Guptill punched that hard and only a good piece of fielding prevented any runsGuptill and Ryder are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Bhuvneshwar will open the attackEarlier, the move to open with Kohli failed but Rohit came good today and was all set for a hundred, before he fell to a leg-side strangle. The Kiwis bounced out the first three batsmen, and were disciplined in their line and lengths before fading away during the last 10 overs. Still they would think that 279 is a gettable one on this track. Whether they do so, or India rein them in, to stay alive in the series, will only be known when the 2nd innings starts. We will be there shortly to bring you all the action from that. Don't go too far. Do stay tuned.A magnificent 127-run stand between Dhoni and Jadeja has taken India to 278 which should give the bowlers a chance. Savage hitting in the end overs, but it was Jadeja who was the one who upped the ante, as Dhoni was content to feed him the strike during the early part of their stand. India looked in a spot of bother when Ashwin fell, but that rollicking stand has given them a healthy total.4
INDIA:49.6 Neesham to Dhoni, SIX, murdered! Dhoni has launched that into the tree. A massive hit to end the innings. Way over long-on. No chance for anyone in the crowd to catch that as well. Superb end to the innings by the Indian skipper.
INDIA:49.5 Neesham to Ravindra Jadeja, leg byes, 1 run, tries to swing a slower delivery on the pads, misses, they take a leg-bye
INDIA:49.4 Neesham to Ravindra Jadeja, leg byes, 2 runs, what has happened there? Neesh, what have you done? He could've walked and taken the bails off, instead he misses the stumps from just touching distance with an under-arm flick. Jadeja was nowhere in the picture, to rub salt into the wounds, they take an extra run. Neesham is down on his haunches. I still can't believe that he messed that run-out chance up
INDIA:49.3 Neesham to Dhoni, 1 run, pulled to deep mid wicket, flat and on the bounce to the man, only a single
INDIA:49.2 Neesham to Dhoni, SIX, Dhoni tees off. Length outside off, swung away into the wide long-on fence. The spectators go for an one-handed grab, but don't even lay a hand on it. Was off the toe end of the bat, but such is the power of the man
INDIA:49.1 Neesham to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, tries to launch over the on-side, but mistimes it to deep mid wicket, brings Dhoni on strike thoughJames Neesham [7.0-0-45-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:48.6 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, well disguised slower delivery, Ravindra Jadeja was initially looking for the big wicket, then saw the ball dipping, adjusts and dabs it on the off-side. Good stuff that from Mills in the 49th over of the innings
INDIA:48.5 Mills to Dhoni, 1 run, good bowling. Full and wide outside off, as he sees Dhoni charging out, squeezed out into the off-side
INDIA:48.4 Mills to Dhoni, no run, Dhoni tries to be too cute this time and misses with an attempted paddle. Too much pre-meditation in that and he misses. That was there to be smacked over cover
INDIA:48.3 Mills to Dhoni, FOUR, length balls are not that ones to be bowling to Dhoni at this point of the innings. Frees his arms and launches it over midwicket, one bounce over the ropes
INDIA:48.2 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, low full toss on the stumps, Ravindra Jadeja makes room and drives to extra cover, only a singleFirst time in his ODI career, that Jadeja has made back to back fifties
INDIA:48.1 Mills to Dhoni, 1 run, swung away to backward square leg, Ross Taylor is there, sweeping and that's only a single
INDIA:47.6 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, this time Nathan M can't rein it back in. Full toss outside off, belted really hard and races across the turf, beating Nathan who didn't even dive this time. 250 has come up for India
INDIA:47.5 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, 2 runs, great fielding by Nathan M, running from long-off, runs hard and dives full length to pull it back, saves two runs for his side
INDIA:47.4 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, good comeback from Bennett, fires the yorker length delivery outside off, Ravindra Jadeja can't squeeze it out towards third man
INDIA:47.3 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, back to back fifties for Ravindra Jadeja and this has been a fine innings. His 8th fifty and he raises the bat, to good applause from the Seddon Park crowd. Low full toss, driven wide of cover and beats the man in the deep easily
INDIA:47.3 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, wide, well outside off and that's another wide. Bennett is feeling the pressure
INDIA:47.3 Bennett to Dhoni, 2 wides, Ronchi has made a mess of that. Slower delivery, down leg, Ronchi fumbles and gives away an extra run
INDIA:47.2 Bennett to Dhoni, FOUR, Dhoni slogs and gets a thick outside edge over Ronchi. Nothing Bennett can do about that, perhaps he should not have bowled outside off
INDIA:47.1 Bennett to Dhoni, no run, that wasn't far from hitting the off stump. Didn't bounce a lot and Dhoni was early into the slog, misses and sees the ball go over his stumpsHamish Bennett [8.0-0-50-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:46.6 Mills to Dhoni, 1 run, played with an open face towards backward point, Dhoni retains the strike with that runMills loses his footing. Has to go back and start all over again
INDIA:46.5 Mills to Dhoni, no run, Dhoni is beaten, trying to force it away through the off-side. Length ball, angled across him, he plays and misses
INDIA:46.4 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, low full toss, driven to long-off, much better delivery that time
INDIA:46.3 Mills to Dhoni, 1 run, Mills is lucky that this delivery has gone only for a single. Full and down leg, with short fine inside, isn't the right ball to bowl, but Dhoni finds the man with a clip
INDIA:46.2 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, pitched up outside off, driven to long-off
INDIA:46.1 Mills to Dhoni, 1 run, Dhoni charges Mills and fails to get the requisite timing as he gets too close to the pitch of the ball, dribbles away to long-on
INDIA:45.6 Neesham to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, full on the stumps, driven back to the bowler who fields in his followthrough
INDIA:45.5 Neesham to Dhoni, 1 run, shortish outside off, dabbed square of the wicket, another single

INDIA:45.3 Neesham to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, dabbed, straight to the fielder at point
INDIA:45.3 Neesham to Ravindra Jadeja, wide, slower delivery, down leg, called a wide and rightly so
INDIA:45.2 Neesham to Dhoni, 1 run, this short ball gets too big on Dhoni and he can only top-edge it towards long-on, doesn't carry to the man though
INDIA:45.1 Neesham to Dhoni, FOUR, third fifty on the trot for Dhoni in this series. What a way to get there as well. It was flat-batted with supreme power, almost took out Neesham in his followthrough, the bowler ducked and saw the ball just go over his head. Brutal hit that from Dhoni, laced with unbelievable power
INDIA:44.6 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, Ravindra Jadeja has a smile on his face, while Mills holds his hands on his head. Poor stuff from the short fine fielder, it was hit with power, but straight to him, he slides to his left too quickly and over-runs the ball, allows to go past him. Perhaps that delivery deserved a boundary anyway
INDIA:44.5 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, slower delivery outside off, softly dabbed to short third, again no single available
INDIA:44.4 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, dabs it to point, wants the single, sent back by Dhoni as he sees Williamson swooping in on the ball
INDIA:44.3 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, full and on the stumps, flicked to midwicket where Baz fields
INDIA:44.2 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, Ravindra Jadeja is the man getting India the boundaries. Low full toss on the pads, Jadeja clips it past the man inside the ring at short fine. Easily done. Mills wipes the sweat off his brow
INDIA:44.1 Mills to Dhoni, 1 run, Dhoni advances and clips the length ball on the pads to backward square leg
INDIA:43.6 Neesham to Dhoni, 1 run, works it to short fine leg, Mills' arm is not that great, Dhoni takes him on and makes his crease
INDIA:43.5 Neesham to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, tapped towards point, a quick single taken
INDIA:43.4 Neesham to Dhoni, 1 run, full and almost in the blockhole, Dhoni jams it out to long-on
INDIA:43.3 Neesham to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, works it from middle stump, gives the strike back to Dhoni
INDIA:43.2 Neesham to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, this is clever batting. Knows that the short third is inside the ring, so dabs the length ball outside off, wide of the man
INDIA:43.1 Neesham to Dhoni, 1 run, shortish outside off, Dhoni plays a slightly awkward looking shot, swatting it with no timing to square legJames Neesham [5.0-0-28-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:42.6 Mills to Dhoni, 1 run, full and on the pads, Dhoni works it to backward square leg, to keep strike
INDIA:42.5 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, similar shot to the last one, but this time the ball goes wide of the fielder, so the single is on, they take it
INDIA:42.4 Mills to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, off-break, on off stump, Ravindra Jadeja dabs it to point, wants the single, but Dhoni sends him back
INDIA:42.3 Mills to Dhoni, 1 run, softly dabs this into the point area, the strike now is with Ravindra Jadeja
INDIA:42.2 Mills to Dhoni, 2 runs, good running from both batsmen. Softly turns this through the short midwicket area, calls for two and takes it easily as the deep fielder comes in to field
INDIA:42.1 Mills to Dhoni, no run, from round the wicket, Dhoni shuffles across a tad and defends it softly, right behind his legsKyle Mills [6.0-2-15-1] is back into the attack
INDIA:41.6 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, SIX, Bang! Ravindra Jadeja is in a punishing mood today. Length ball outside off, Jadeja lofts through the line and strikes it on the rise. The ball goes flat and over the long-off ropes
INDIA:41.5 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, a check drive, but straight to the fielder at cover
INDIA:41.4 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, much better length that from Bennett - full and on off, defended to point with an open face
INDIA:41.3 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, now Ravindra Jadeja emulates his skipper. Takes the short delivery from outside off and pulls it really well, cross-batted it hard and down into the ground, into the midwicket area. Bennett is exasperated after that
INDIA:41.2 Bennett to Dhoni, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Dhoni throws his bat and gets a thick outside edge down to third man
INDIA:41.1 Bennett to Dhoni, FOUR, brutal power that from Dhoni. Slightly short from Bennett as he keeps it outside off, Dhoni unleashes a savage pull wide of mid-on. No-one moved a muscle in the field
INDIA:40.6 Williamson to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, calmly keeps the final delivery out
INDIA:40.5 Williamson to Ravindra Jadeja, SIX, Ravindra Jadeja has had enough of the dots, takes this from middle, kneels down and slog sweeps it flat and hard, just over the wide long-on fence. That was timed really well and a much needed boundary for the Indians
INDIA:40.4 Williamson to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, just a hint of turn away, Ravindra Jadeja adjusts and dabs towards point
INDIA:40.3 Williamson to Dhoni, 1 run, gets forward and pushes it to long off

INDIA:40.1 Williamson to Dhoni, no run, well tossed up outside off, driven hard, but straight back to WilliamsonKane Williamson [2.0-0-19-1] is back into the attackMeanwhile, Dhoni changes his willow. Sign of things to come?So the end of the powerplay and India have just scored 24 with Dhoni exercising extreme caution. Maybe he wants to be there at the end and take India to a total, which will give his bowlers a chance to defend whatever they post on the board. Sensible tactic from the Indian skipper.
INDIA:39.6 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, dabbed to point from the crease
INDIA:39.5 Bennett to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR, too much width and too much room for Ravindra Jadeja - short and wide outside off - he accepts the gift and cuts really hard through cover

INDIA:35.3 Southee to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, on the pads, flicked to backward square leg

India were going well but the wickets of Rayudu, Rohit and Ashwin mean that Dhoni and Jadeja will have do really well to get the team to a good score.
INDIA:33.1 Southee to Ashwin, out Caught by Bennett!! He's cut that too well and too fine for India's liking. Short and wide outside off stump, there to be hit, probably Ashwin played that a bit late and hence sliced it, the ball went flat, third man took a couple of steps and took a good catch to his right.

INDIA:31.5 Southee to Rohit, no run, short delivery on the stumps, Rohit ducks under it
INDIA:31.4 Southee to Rohit, SIX, fine hit. Just backed away a touch and lofted it over deep extra-cover. The length was just perfect for that shot, it was short enough for Rohit to get underneath it and help himself to another maximum

It was more a get-out-of-jail shot from Rayudu, short delivery outside off stump, he tried to fetch the pull forcefully and send it over mid-wicket, but only managed to top-edge it in the air and the keeper takes a simple catch. It was clever thinking from the bowler to bowl that a little wider from the off stump. Rayudu c Ronchi b Bennett 37(58) [4s-3 6s-2]Bennett to Rayudu, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Short delivery on the off stump, Kohli looks to pull but gets a top edge, the ball goes only as far mid-wicket where Neesham takes a very simple catch. So the move to make Kohli open hasn't worked. Good thinking from Southee to bang it short. It was the first bouncer from New Zealand and Kohli wasn't ready at all. Kohli c Neesham b Southee 2(10)Southee to Kohli, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Mills will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Here we go for the first ball.McCullum: "We played quite well against West Indies and we have definitely improved a lot against India. We would have batted first as well. We make two changes, Anderson and McClenaghan miss out, Mills and Neesham come in, it's a big opportunity for them."Dhoni: "I think this game will be very crucial from the series perspective. We are playing only upto 60% of our potential. We are looking to bat first. Looks like a good wicket, change of strategy. Shikhar and Raina make way for Rayudu and Binny, a tactical decision more than anything else. Kohli will open the batting."It has been confirmed - Stuart Binny makes his ODI debut, he replaces Dhawan. Rahane in all probability will open the innings. New Zealand have made two changes as well - they have decided to rest Corey Anderson, which is a bit of a surprise and Mitchell McClenaghan. James Neesham and Kyle Mills come back in to replace them.Teams:India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Stuart Binny, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Varun AaronNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Hamish Bennett, Kyle MillsWe are just getting news that Stuart Binny will be making his ODI debut as he has been presented his cap. We will confirm it to you very shortly.India have won the toss and have opted to batA great day in Hamilton - with not a cloud in the sky; perfect conditions to play cricket in. We should've the toss any moment now. Do stay tuned to know what the result of the toss will be.Good day and a warm welcome to wherever one may be as we begin our coverage for the 4th ODI from Seddon Park in Hamilton. In all the three games, before today, India have won the toss and decided to field first - leaving them to chase targets down. They were unsuccessful in the first two, before somehow managing to pull off a tie in the third ODI, to keep the series alive. Will the same pattern follow today as well? Toss and teams in a short while, do stay tuned.Going into the fourth ODI, if anyone had put money on India being down 0-2, requiring wins in both the last two ODIs to square the series, would've been a rich man now. This series has been quite unpredictable with New Zealand proving to be a tough nut to crack in home conditions. They were in the box seat to wrap up the series at Eden Park a couple of days ago, but an inspired Ravindra Jadeja kept India's slim hopes alive as he secured a tie from a no-win situation.Preview:After a gripping tie, India and New Zealand will resume hostilities at the Seddon Park in Hamilton but completely different ambitions. While the hosts would want to win and seal the series, the visiting world champions are desperate to stay in it with a victory on Tuesday. A defeat in Hamilton and India would have succumbed to their second consecutive series loss outside the subcontinent within two months. Can MS Dhoni's men step up and avoid a humiliation?New Zealand: Few would have expected them to dominate India but they have done that with ease and sheer poise. Brendon McCullum's leadership against a powerful Indian side has caught the visitors off guard and they now lie on the cusp of a series defeat. Most things have clicked for the hosts, with their batsmen adopting very aggressive tactics against the weak Indian attack.New Zealand have got off to strong starts, thanks to Martin Guptill and Jesse Ryder at the top, have had periods of consolidation by Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor while Corey Anderson and Luke Ronchi took upon themselves the job of collecting quick runs in the death overs, where a usually toothless Indian bowling attack is at its worse.New Zealand have bowled well too, albeit in patches but those brief spells of sustained pressure have been enough to choke up the Indian batting line-up. The openers have not been allowed to get away and the middle-order barring Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni have been kept on a tight leash.All of that changed in the third ODI, where India got off to a good start and despite a rare Kohli failure, still managed to tie in pursuit of 315. When a mighty Indian batting line-up, in desperate search of a win, decided to throw all caution to the wind and attacked, the Kiwi bowlers were found not a little wanting.But all said, New Zealand are still in a better position, for the series is now theirs to lose.Key Players: As always, when a home team is on song, any player could be dangerous on a given day. Kane Williamson has been in top form, with three consecutive half-centuries, Ross Taylor has looked really good, Martin Guptill is always a threat and he showed how big, with a sublime century in Auckland.But the biggest threat, as always will be Corey Anderson. The powerful southpaw has the ability to hit them long and hard and score quick runs when India's bowlers are most vulnerable - the last 10 overs. And he showed in the tied game what a useful bowler he is, picking up a maiden fifer.India: MS Dhoni exuded confidence after India finally put an end to their four-match losing streak with a sensational tie. The captain hopes now to draw the series and salvage some pride from a series they were expected to dominate. To be fair, the batting has indeed revolved around Dhoni and the ever reliable Kohli, but it has still fared a lot better than the bowling department.India did well to tie the game after India's bowlers had leaked 314, even as Kohli flopped for the first time this series, after a century and a composed 78. Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma did not get the big scores but they got India off to a flier, ensuring the middle-order could always keep the team in the game.Suresh Raina, who is yet to score a half-century since his last against Zimbabwe about five months ago, got involved in a crucial stand with Dhoni while R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja stole the show with the bat after economical bowling spells to keep India alive in the series. But does Dhoni need a minor change in the batting line-up? Would he try Ambati Rayudu or even Stuart Binny instead of Ajinkya Rahane, who has looked out of sorts in the ODI middle-order?The bowling needs to come good. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar has been tight, Mohammad Shami has taken wickets but leaked runs and Varun Aaron, chosen to replace Ishant Sharma proved to be expensive too. The spinners, after much criticism came good, but Dhoni would need his seamers to back him up.Key Players: Kohli does not like getting out cheaply and he would like to make amends for the last game. He is in brilliant form and easily the best batsman in world cricket at the moment. Dhoni, despite the shortcomings of his bowlers, has been in solid form, though the captain himself admitted that he needed to stay and finish these games off.Jadeja's heroics with the bat should propel him to bigger heights, provided he remained consistent. He has been a useful bowler for India but the team management would look at many such knocks from him in the future. Is this a beginning of great things to come from the Saurashtra boy?Quotes:We've just not been at the best of our game. That's the best point we can take forward, in terms of saying, we've not really played our best game yet - R Ashwin, India off-spinner.We are still playing good cricket and still in a good mind frame, we have to keep going that way. We are very much on target to win the series - Luke Ronchi, New Zealand wicketkeeper.Teams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Varun Aaron, Ishant Sharma, Stuart Binny, Ishwar Pandey, Ambati Rayudu, Amit MishraNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Hamish Bennett, James Neesham, Kyle MillsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
