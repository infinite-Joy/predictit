Hotak will open the attackWelcome back.. Can Zimbabwe chase down 224? Afghanistan will open with spin, it's Amir Hamza with the new ball..Zimbabwe have finished their 50 overs in just over three hours. That's what happens when you have five spinners in the side. Afghanistan will not be happy with the final total. They got off to a good start with Shahzad going bonkers. The opening stand was worth 51 runs before the keeper threw it away. Noor Ali Zadran and Nabi continued to build as the pair added 73 runs for the 2nd wicket. The former also registered his second successive fifty. However, with a cluster of wickets falling, the visitors lost momentum and if not for Shafiqullah Shafiq and Dawlat Zadran, the total wouldn't have crossed 200. Zimbabwe should fancy their chances in chasing this down. Join us in a few minutes for their reply...4
