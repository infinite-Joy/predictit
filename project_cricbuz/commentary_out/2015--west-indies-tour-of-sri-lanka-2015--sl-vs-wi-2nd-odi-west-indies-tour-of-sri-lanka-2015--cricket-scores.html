SRI LANKA:7.6 Samuels to K Perera, no run, down the leg-side, Perera fails to glance it fine and the keeper doesn't collect it either. Strangely, the umpire doesn't signal a wide and Perera doesn't look happy with that call
SRI LANKA:7.5 Samuels to K Perera, no run, comes on the front foot to defend, ends up squeezing it out to mid-wicket off the inside half of the bat

SRI LANKA:4.1 Narine to Dilshan, out Bowled!! Here we go! Narine comes on and Dilshan's stumps have been disturbed. This was the seam up ball from Narine, it swung back in sharply as well. Dilshan was caught in the crease as he looks to force it off the back foot, misses it completely and the ball crashes into the off stump. Once again Narine has got an important breakthrough at a rather crucial time. Dilshan was clueless about it. The crowd at the Premadasa is silenced. Dilshan b Narine 17(13) [4s-3]Narine to Dilshan, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Sunil Narine, right-arm off break, comes into the attackNarine was very impressive in the last game. Sri Lanka have got off to a blazing start? Can he break this partnership? Let's find out
SRI LANKA:3.6 Jerome Taylor to K Perera, no run, on a good length and outside off, Perera opens the face of the bat and pushes it towards backward point, wanted a single but it's not there
SRI LANKA:3.5 Jerome Taylor to K Perera, SIX, the crowd gets going! Fullish delivery outside off, Perera stays rooted to the crease and just lofts it through the line, the timing was sublime and it clears the long-off fence as well
SRI LANKA:3.4 Jerome Taylor to K Perera, leg byes, FOUR, this one swung back in a long way but unfortunately Taylor sprays it on the pads, Perera can't tickle it fine but the ball clips the pad before dribbling away to the fine leg fence
SRI LANKA:3.3 Jerome Taylor to Dilshan, 1 run, fullish delivery in the channel outside off, Dilshan looks to drive, gets a thickish outside edge that rolls away towards third man

SRI LANKA:3.1 Jerome Taylor to K Perera, no run, short of length delivery outside off, Perera punches it to the right of extra cover, who moves across and stops the ball
SRI LANKA:2.6 Rampaul to Dilshan, no run, length delivery angling in on the pads, Dilshan fails to work it away and the ball rolls into the off-side off the pad, was a little high and would have gone down leg. Hence, there was no appeal from the men from the Caribbean
SRI LANKA:2.5 Rampaul to Dilshan, no run, slower ball on a length and around off, Dilshan comes forward and knocks it towards extra cover
SRI LANKA:2.4 Rampaul to Dilshan, 2 runs, pitched up and swinging in on middle, Dilshan comes across and clips it through mid-wicket, easily comes back for the second

SRI LANKA:1.6 Jerome Taylor to K Perera, FOUR, poor effort from Brathwaite at mid-on, Perera whips this length delivery through the mid-wicket region, Brathwaite from mid-on runs to his left, puts in the dive but ends up diving over the ball, the ball trickles away to the fence. Should have done better there
SRI LANKA:1.5 Jerome Taylor to K Perera, no run, just short of a good length and outside off, Perera stands tall and punches it to extra cover
SRI LANKA:1.5 Jerome Taylor to Dilshan, 2 wides, down the leg-side, the keeper doesn't collect it cleanly and the batsmen take an extra run before the ball is hunted down near the fine leg fence
SRI LANKA:1.4 Jerome Taylor to Dilshan, FOUR, ohh dear! That's a complete misjudgement of a catching opportunity. Back of a length delivery outside off, Dilshan was first looking to go hard at it and then checks his shot at the last moment, closes the face a little too early and gets a leading edge that flies towards Rampaul at third man, who came in thinking that the ball would fall in front of him, but in fact it goes over his head, bounces just before the rope and Dilshan gets a boundary
SRI LANKA:1.3 Jerome Taylor to Dilshan, FOUR, lovely! Dilshan is continuing from where he left off in the previous game. Short of length delivery and there was width on offer outside off, Dilshan gets on top of the bounce and punches it past backward point, races away to the fence in a jiffy
SRI LANKA:1.2 Jerome Taylor to Dilshan, no run, just short of a good length and outside off, Dilshan goes a little too hard on the punch, mistimes it completely towards mid-on, thinks about a single but it's not there
SRI LANKA:1.1 Jerome Taylor to Dilshan, FOUR, that's a great shot! He's literally smashed it to the fence. Banged in short and at the batsman, who swivels and muscles the pull through square leg, there was no stopping that ball from reaching the fenceJerome Taylor, right-arm fast, comes into the attack
SRI LANKA:0.6 Rampaul to Dilshan, 1 run, another short delivery from Rampaul, Dilshan transfers his weight onto the back foot and pulls it through backward square leg, there's protection in the deep and it will only be a single
SRI LANKA:0.5 Rampaul to Dilshan, no run, pitched up and a hint of outswing just outside off, Dilshan comes on the front foot and drives it to mid-off
SRI LANKA:0.4 Rampaul to K Perera, 1 run, touch fuller outside off, Perera goes hard on the drive, the ball takes the outside edge and flies past the fielder at slip, goes on the bounce to the man at third man
SRI LANKA:0.3 Rampaul to K Perera, FOUR, Perera is not going to hold back. Two balls and he is off in a flash. Short and at the batsman's body, Perera swivels on the pull and sends it up and over backward square leg, hits the fence in no time
SRI LANKA:0.2 Rampaul to K Perera, no run, slightly back of a length delivery angled across off, Perera stands tall and punches it to mid-off
SRI LANKA:0.1 Rampaul to K Perera, no run, short of length delivery that comes back in from around off, Perera was cramped for room as he looks to defend, misses it completely and wears it on the bodyK Perera and Dilshan are at the crease. K Perera is on strike. Rampaul will open the attackThe West Indian players are making their way out to the middle, followed by the Sri Lankan openers. Rampaul will start the proceedings with the ball. Let's see if he gets some swing first up. Just a slip in placeSo the revised target for Sri Lanka is 225. It could have been a little more had West Indies applied themselves towards the end. Johnson Charles made a breezy fifty before the rain break and then skipper Marlon Samuels hit a vital fifty after the break. Both batsmen scored a total of 146, while the rest managed just 58 runs. That tells you the story. Lasith Mailnga was impressive with two wickets, while Siriwardana was also good for two wickets. Sri Lanka have a tricky total ahead. Can they handle the pressure of a run chase? We'll find out in a while.3
WEST INDIES:37.4 Malinga to Rampaul, out Narine Run Out!! 1 run completed. This is ugly cricket from West Indies. They have lost their last 4 wickets for 2 runs and all four have been run-outs. They were well on course to make at least 225, but they have been bowled out for 214. Slower delivery on the stumps, Rampaul looks to defend as he was beaten by the lack of pace, the ball takes the inside edge and rolls to square leg, Narine wants two but is sent back, Mathews runs from short fine leg and throws it to the keeper, who does the rest. Narine run out (Mathews/K Perera) 0(1)Malinga to Rampaul, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!Ravi Rampaul, left handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:37.3 Malinga to Narine, out Brathwaite Run Out!! Good length delivery on the stumps, Narine defends it down the pitch, Brathwaite takes a while to take off and that cost him his wicket. Malinga ran forward, picked it up and under-armed the ball onto the stumps. West Indies have lost their last 3 wickets for 2 runs. Brathwaite run out (Malinga) 17(13) [4s-1 6s-1]Malinga to Narine, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!Another direct-hit and looks like Malinga has his man. Third umpire has been called to check and Brathwaite is short. OUT!
WEST INDIES:37.2 Malinga to Brathwaite, 1 run, slower delivery on the leg stump, Brathwaite goes early into the pull, it goes uppishly to the right of mid-wicketSunil Narine, left handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:37.1 Malinga to Jerome Taylor, out Jerome Taylor Run Out!! Malinga takes aim and baaangg, fires a direct-hit. Slower delivery on the stumps, Taylor defends it to the left of the bowler, they try to steal a run, but it wasn't too far away from Malinga, who quickly moved to his left, turned and hit the stumps at his end. Jerome Taylor run out (Malinga) 1(2)Malinga to Jerome Taylor, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!Lasith Malinga [7.0-0-41-2] is back into the attack
WEST INDIES:36.6 A Mendis to Jerome Taylor, 1 run, on the leg stump, Taylor drives it to long-onJerome Taylor, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:36.5 A Mendis to Samuels, out Samuels Run Out!! 1 run completed. Oh no! A big mix-up. West Indies needed Samuels to face Malinga in the next over, but he has to go now. Anyway, the captain has played a good innings. On the leg stump, nudged wide of long-on, Brathwaite always wanted two, it could have been an easy two, but Samuels wasn't sure about it. He actually stood his ground at the non-striker's end, but as Brathwaite almost reached the non-striker's end, Samuels moves out of his crease. Mendis collects the throw and fires it to the keeper, who takes his own time to dislodge a bail. Samuels run out (Thirimanne/A Mendis/K Perera) 63(61) [4s-4 6s-2]A Mendis to Samuels, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
WEST INDIES:36.4 A Mendis to Brathwaite, 1 run, quicker delivery on the off stump, Brathwaite punches it late towards mid-on
WEST INDIES:36.3 A Mendis to Samuels, 1 run, on the leg stump, Samuels works it to mid-wicket, thinks about two but the fielder from the deep was quick to get to the ball
WEST INDIES:36.2 A Mendis to Samuels, no run, ah! Samuels will be kicking himself for not hitting the gap. Short and outside off stump, cut straight to backward point
WEST INDIES:36.1 A Mendis to Samuels, no run, flighted delivery on the stumps, Samuels defends off the front foot
WEST INDIES:35.6 Lakmal to Samuels, 1 run, low full toss, driven hard once again, deep extra-cover runs to his left and tidies up, not a bad result for West Indies as Samuels will have the strike
WEST INDIES:35.5 Lakmal to Samuels, SIX, short and wide, cut away fiercely and boy, that has cleared the boundary. Short and on the stumps, Samuels gives himself some room by clearing his front leg out of the way, cuts hard over backward point and it's a handy maximum
WEST INDIES:35.4 Lakmal to Brathwaite, 1 run, short of length delivery on the leg stump, Brathwaite mistimes the pull to mid-wicket as he was cramped for room
WEST INDIES:35.3 Lakmal to Brathwaite, SIX, that's the way to do it, Carlos Brathwaite! Slower delivery goes nice and full, Brathwaite picks it, waits and muscles the loft back over Lakmal's head for a maximum. That brings up the 200 for West Indies
WEST INDIES:35.2 Lakmal to Samuels, 1 run, full delivery on the leg stump, Samuels swings hard and gets an inside edge to fine leg
WEST INDIES:35.1 Lakmal to Brathwaite, 1 run, oh this is interesting! It's a full toss and Brathwaite only wants to guide this to backward point, I don't think his idea should be giving the strike back to Samuels as he can smash them himself. It was a direct-hit at the striker's end, but Samuels manages to ground his bat in timeSuranga Lakmal [6.0-0-35-1] is back into the attackThree overs to go, West Indies would be targetting at least 25-30 runs.
WEST INDIES:34.6 A Mendis to Brathwaite, 1 run, Brathwaite gets down on one knee and paddle-sweeps, Malinga dives to his right at short fine leg and saves a few

WEST INDIES:34.4 A Mendis to Samuels, 1 run, on the leg stump, Samuels works it to mid-wicket
WEST INDIES:34.3 A Mendis to Brathwaite, 1 run, guided straight to short third man, oh but Mathews fires an overthrow and allows the single to be taken. It was well wide of the keeper
WEST INDIES:34.2 A Mendis to Brathwaite, no run, flatter delivery outside off stump, Brathwaite pushes it back to the bowler
WEST INDIES:34.1 A Mendis to Samuels, 1 run, flighted delivery outside off stump, Samuels drives it down to long-off
WEST INDIES:34.1 A Mendis to Samuels, wide, oh! Samuels almost lost balance and was stumped. Slider down the leg-side, Samuels misses the glance, overbalances, Perera collects and waits but Samuels manages to keep his back foot ground all the timeSome issues with the sightscreen. All sorted now!
WEST INDIES:33.6 Malinga to Brathwaite, FOUR, slower delivery, edged and no one at slip. The fans go silent in the stands. Slower delivery outside off stump, Brathwaite tries to defend, gets an edge and gets away with it as it runs very fine past the keeper
WEST INDIES:33.5 Malinga to Brathwaite, no run, back over the wicket to Brathwaite. Slower delivery outside off stump, Brathwaite tries to run it down to third man, gets an under edge that rolls to the keeper
WEST INDIES:33.4 Malinga to Samuels, 1 run, that could have been a run-out, but Lakmal wasn't accurate enough. Very full slower delivery, Samuels guides it to short third man, Brathwaite calls for a quick single and makes his ground. The side angle shows that Brathwaite would have been in even with a direct-hit
WEST INDIES:33.3 Malinga to Samuels, 2 runs, full and on the leg stump, Samuels clips it away behind square on the on-side and that gives him his 26th ODI fifty. Finally, Samuels has a score against his name on this tour
WEST INDIES:33.2 Malinga to Samuels, no run, ah! Samuels doesn't pick this slower delivery, just hangs his bat at it and gets beatenMalinga to come round the wicket
WEST INDIES:33.1 Malinga to Samuels, SIX, who says picking Malinga is difficult? What a shot Marlon Samuels. He seems to love playing Malinga at this venue. Rewind three years back, this man thrashed Malinga in the 2012 World T20 final. This was the slower delivery right in the slot, Samuels waits and muscles the loft back over the bowler's headIf you were thinking West Indies are losing some firepower, you were wrong. This man, Carlos Brathwaite, made a 58-ball 113 in the practice match against Sri Lanka Board President's XI.
WEST INDIES:32.6 A Mendis to Samuels, 1 run, this time goes on the back foot and punches it to deep extra-cover
WEST INDIES:32.5 A Mendis to Samuels, no run, flatter in trajectory, Samuels looks to cut but gets beaten, the ball seemed to have kept a bit low on that occasion
WEST INDIES:32.4 A Mendis to Samuels, no run, on the stumps, worked into the on-side
WEST INDIES:32.3 A Mendis to Samuels, no run, appeal for LBW, looks close, but no review from Sri Lanka. Samuels is late on the flick, the ball hits him in line with leg stump, umpire Rod Tucker feels that it was missing leg
WEST INDIES:32.2 A Mendis to Samuels, no run, beaten! Quicker delivery outside off stump, Samuels slashes and misses
WEST INDIES:32.1 A Mendis to Samuels, no run, flatter delivery outside off stump, Samuels squeezes out the drive to backward point, who moves to his left and stop itAjantha Mendis [4.0-0-34-0] is back into the attack
WEST INDIES:31.6 Malinga to Samuels, 1 run, a cover-drive that is hit hard, but along the ground to deep extra-cover
WEST INDIES:31.5 Malinga to Samuels, 2 runs, in the airrrrr, oh dropped. Shehan Jayasuriya in the culprit. Full and on the stumps, as has been the case after the rain break, Samuels opens himself up and lofts the drive inside-out over cover, Mathews had stationed a man in the deep for the exact shot and the ploy almost worked. Jayasuriya went down quickly and hence the ball hit the wrists and popped out
WEST INDIES:31.4 Malinga to Brathwaite, 1 run, pacy yorker, Brathwaite glances it away to fine leg
WEST INDIES:31.3 Malinga to Brathwaite, no run, slower delivery outside off stump, Brathwaite defends with an angled bat to backward pointCarlos Brathwaite, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:31.2 Malinga to J Mohammed, out Caught by Chandimal!! Slower delivery, leading edge, straight to the fielder - as simple as that. Mohammed was never picking Malinga's slower ones, this time with laden feet, Mohammed tries to work it into the on-side, swung hard enough for the edge to easily carry to the man at short cover. J Mohammed c Chandimal b Malinga 4(10)Malinga to J Mohammed, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
WEST INDIES:31.1 Malinga to Samuels, 1 run, having seen Samuels expose the sticks by clearing his front leg, Mathews has a man at deep extra-cover and Samuels' drive goes straight to him
WEST INDIES:30.6 Lakmal to J Mohammed, 2 runs, cut away, work to do for Siriwardana running to his right from third man and he does well. Covers decent ground and bends down in time to collect it with both hands. Lakmal gets away with a short ball outside off stump as Mohammed doesn't get the timing right on the cut
WEST INDIES:30.5 Lakmal to J Mohammed, no run, full and in the slot, but Mohammed only manages to drive it back to the bowler
WEST INDIES:30.4 Lakmal to Samuels, 1 run, good comeback by Lakmal after being thrashed for a couple of fours, nails the yorker on the leg stump, the leg-side moving Samuels could only dig it out to mid-off
WEST INDIES:30.3 Lakmal to Samuels, FOUR, now he gets it right from the middle of the bat. Looks like the responsibility of leadership is getting the best out of Samuels. Oops! I hope I haven't jinxed it! Unlike the previous ball, Lakmal follows Samuels when he makes room and pays the penalty. The length was short and Samuels easily cuts off the back foot, the ball rockets past backward point
WEST INDIES:30.2 Lakmal to Samuels, no run, once again stays leg-side and this time he tries to cut the length ball late, but misses it completely
WEST INDIES:30.1 Lakmal to Samuels, FOUR, crashed! Thankfully, it was in the gap, otherwise, it could have taken a finger or two with it! Gee he hit that hard did Marlon Samuels. Full and just outside off stump, with his front leg out of the way, Samuels gets into a great position to generate full power and crashes the drive through extra-cover
WEST INDIES:29.6 Malinga to J Mohammed, no run, almost a leading edge back to the bowler, slower delivery just outside off stump, Mohammed tries to defend, again unsure about the pace on the ball, ends up playing a little early, he is lucky that the ball didn't go to hand
WEST INDIES:29.5 Malinga to J Mohammed, no run, nice and full, Mohammed is not picking them out of Malinga's hand, one can understand as it is extremely difficult to read Malinga from the hand at his delivery stride, juicy full ball but it is driven straight to mid-off
WEST INDIES:29.4 Malinga to J Mohammed, no run, Mohammed has no clue about this slower delivery, fails to defend the ball, gets hit high on the thigh pad
WEST INDIES:29.3 Malinga to Samuels, 1 run, almost a yorker on leg stump, Samuels drills it down to long-on
WEST INDIES:29.2 Malinga to Samuels, 2 runs, Samuels clears the front leg out of the way, Malinga bowls a full ball outside off stump and it is driven past the diving fielder at short extra-cover

WEST INDIES:28.6 Lakmal to Samuels, no run, Samuels backs away and looks to slash, but Lakmal follows him with a short ball and Samuels ends up playing almost a pull shot, no contact though

WEST INDIES:28.4 Lakmal to J Mohammed, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Mohammed defends it towards backward point
WEST INDIES:28.3 Lakmal to J Mohammed, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Mohammed hops and defendsJason Mohammed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:28.2 Lakmal to J Carter, out Bowled!! The Sri Lankan fans are elated in the stands and why not! Actually not all that great a delivery, but Carter has dragged it back onto the base of the middle pole. Short of a length angling across, it was outside off stump, probably Carter was into the pull shot a little early and the under edge shattered the timber behind him. Carter is really disappointed with himself. J Carter b Lakmal 5(20)Lakmal to J Carter, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
WEST INDIES:28.1 Lakmal to Samuels, 1 run, good length delivery outside off stump, Samuels stays leg-side and runs it down to third man with an angled batSuranga Lakmal [4.0-0-22-0] is back into the attack
WEST INDIES:27.6 Malinga to J Carter, no run, this is the slower ball from Malinga with a bit of extra bounce, Carter looks to defend, the ball hits him on the glove and he feels the pain
WEST INDIES:27.5 Malinga to J Carter, no run, this time the conventional short of length delivery from Slinga, Carter once again tries to steer to third man, probably he was expecting a slower one and was clearly late on the shot
WEST INDIES:27.4 Malinga to J Carter, no run, slower delivery that is bowled nicely, Carter waits and defends, can't really say that he picked it from Malinga's hand
WEST INDIES:27.3 Malinga to J Carter, no run, oh almost dragged on! Carter was looking to run this length ball down to third man, ended up playing away from the body and the under edge hit the back boot and bounced past the stumps
WEST INDIES:27.2 Malinga to Samuels, 1 run, Samuels hops and tucks this short of length delivery to the right of the man at mid-wicket
WEST INDIES:27.1 Malinga to Samuels, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Samuels defends off the back footLasith Malinga [3.0-0-18-1] is back into the attackRevised playing conditions: Three bowlers can bowl a maximum of 8 overs and two can bowl a maximum of 7 overs. No word about the duration of the innings break. I assume that it must be very short.
WEST INDIES:26.6 Senanayake to J Carter, no run, cut away nicely off the back foot, but point dives to his right and saves a few
WEST INDIES:26.5 Senanayake to Samuels, 1 run, flighted delivery on the stumps, Samuels works it into the on-sideWelcome back for the resumption. Rain had played spoilsport, but everything seems fine now. The groundsmen are the unsung heroes as they have worked hard to dry the ground.19:04 Local Time, 13:34 GMT, 19:04 IST: Great news as the match is scheduled to re-start in another 25 minutes at 19:30 local. It will be 38 overs per side.18:54 Local Time, 13:24 GMT, 18:54 IST: The super-sopper is in action and most of the covers have been removed. Umpires too are out in the middle.18:35 Local Time, 13:05 GMT, 18:35 IST: The rain has again stopped. Groundsmen are making their way out to the middle and the main cover is being removed now.18:10 Local Time, 12:40 GMT, 18:10 IST: Finally some good news as the rain appears to have stopped. However, there are dark clouds still hovering over the ground. Oh hang on! Just when I was typing this, the drizzle has returned!18:04 Local Time, 12:34 GMT, 18:04 IST: There is still a light drizzle. On the other hand, the groundsmen are having a discussion in the middle.Roshan Abeysinghe has tweeted: Rain still very heavy. Not looking good. The frustration is umpires can wait up to almost 9 to call off as the need is just 20 overs.17:44 Local Time, 12:14 GMT, 17:44 IST: We have started losing overs now.17:28 Local Time, 11:58 GMT, 17:28 IST: The rain has eased out to an extent. However, the persistent drizzle continues.17:00 Local Time, 11:30 GMT, 17:00 IST: Looks like we will not have play anytime soon as it is bucketing down. Another few minutes left before we start losing overs. In fact, with rain being forecast later on for the day, it was a curious decision from Samuels to go for the option of batting first. Remember, the D/L Method favours the side batting second.16:45 Local Time, 11:15 GMT, 16:45 IST: Not great news folks! This is what we got from the official Twitter handle of the West Indies Cricket Board. "News not good from Colombo: heavy rain, loud thunder, some serious lightning around the Premadasa. We remain hopeful of a re-start."16:35 Local Time, 11:05 GMT, 16:35 IST: Unfortunately, the entire ground is covered now. We are in for a long delay I guess.16:18 Local Time, 10:48 GMT, 16:18 IST: The umpires have decided that the rain is heavy enough and the groundsmen are bringing on the covers. It looks very dark, but it is not really pouring at the moment. Fingers crossed!

The umpire checks for Malinga's front foot. Wait a minute! This looks very close. Did Malinga have something behind the line when he first landed his foot? Or will it be called a no-ball?

It should be a little difficult for the batsmen on this pitch. It looks very dry. The wicket might bind together when there's a bit of rain around and we would have liked to chase anyway with the weather around. Chandimal is back in the side in place of Gunathilaka. It was great for Mendis to finish the game. I am not fully fit to bowl, but if needed I will have to bowl.'Samuels: 'We are going to have a bat. There are a couple of changes. Blackwood, Mohammed and Ravi (Rampaul) come in. We want to put some runs on the board, we don't want to lose wickets upfront. There's a lot of responsiblity on me, I want to keep a good frame of mind and bat.'Pitch Report: 'This looks a lot drier. Come the second session, there will be some wear and tear. The captain who wins the toss will be looking to bat first. There will be more turn and the bowlers should use their variations today', reckons Russel ArnoldSurprise-surprise! The stand-in skipper for the West Indies, Marlon Samuels has decided to bat first. Considering that there's some cloud cover around, it's a very interesting call.West Indies have won the toss and have opted to batSri Lanka will now have the services of Dinesh Chandimal, after the right-handed batsman missed the opening ODI, serving a one-match ban for his altercation with Ishant Sharma in the recently concluded Test series against India. Tillakaratne Dilshan, who scored a match-winning fifty the other day, clearly mentioned that West Indies did not get the length right to him. Can the visitors pull up their socks and put up a spirited show? Andre Russell injured himself while bowling in the first game and we are unsure of his availability for today's contest. Meanwhile, Ravi Rampaul is expected to take Holder's place. We'll get the official confirmation soon as the toss isn't too far away...I would like to give you some great news. Although there are a few clouds around, there has been no rain since morning. So we are all set for a prompt start. Talking about the first game, Sunil Narine made a big impact on his return to international cricket as he turned the match on its head with three wickets in a single over. From nowhere, West Indies snatched the advantage back from Sri Lanka, but Ajantha Mendis showed great batting skills and calmness to snatch the game from West Indies' bag.A couple of days ago, rain showed mercy just in time to allow the 3-match ODI series to get off to a thrilling start. Having narrowly lost the opening ODI, this is a must-win game for West Indies to keep the series alive. However, all is not well for them in the build up to the match as their regular captain Jason Holder has been banned for today's encounter due to his side's slow over rate in the first ODI. It has been told that Marlon Samuels, who has hardly done anything on this tour, will be leading the side. Will responsibility get the best out of Samuels? We'll wait and watch.Preview:After a thrilling finish to the first One-Day International (ODI) between Sri Lanka and West Indies at the R Premadasa stadium, both teams will battle again at the same venue on Wednesday (November 4) with the hosts eager to put up a better show after surviving a scare. In a match reduced to 26 overs per side because of multiple rain interruptions, Sri Lanka could only get the better of the Caribbean side thanks to a calm knock under pressure by Ajantha Mendis. Angelo Mathews had no qualms in admitting that the hosts made a mess of things in the first game and he will be hoping that they are more clinical in the next game as they attempt to take an unassailable 2-0 lead. Meanwhile, West Indies are likely to be without two of their key players for different reasons and they will need to come up with a strong performance if they are to prevent the hosts from registering a series win.Barring Tillakaratne Dilshan, none of the Lankan batsmen showed enough application, including the skipper, who started a collapse which left the home team in a dicey position. While they found an unlikely saviour in Mendis, Sri Lanka will be well aware that it is always a lottery in situations they found themselves in during the first ODI and a disciplined performance is what they will be aiming for.In the bowling department, Sri Lanka's new ball bowlers - Lasith Malinga and Suranga Lakmal - did a good job of keeping the West Indian batsmen in check, with the latter picking up three wickets. Sachitra Senanayake and Shehan Jayasuriya also kept things tight, and a similar performance from the bowlers is what Sri Lanka will expect going into the second ODI.There were also a couple of performances that will be of concern for the hosts. That Mathews and Mendis went for 81 runs combined in seven overs will have the team slightly worried. It was in the death overs that Mathews and Mendis conceded a lot as the key bowlers had finished their quota by then. With another curtailed affair on the cards - thunderstorms being the forecast for Wednesday (November 4) - Mathews needs to have appropriate plans in place for the use of his resources.West Indies have a lot of problems with the top-order and their bowling, and to compound their woes, skipper Jason Holder will miss the second match because of an over-rate offence while Andre Russell is doubtful after limping off the ground during the first ODI. Russell left the ground after stumbling in his follow-through in the fifth over and Holder later admitted that West Indies found it tough to operate with part-time bowlers.Russell and Holder also came up with crucial, aggressive knocks in the opening game, and their absence will be a blow to both the batting and the bowling departments. Jermaine Blackwood, Ravi Rampaul, Devendra Bishoo and Jason Mohammed were the ones benched for the previous game. It remains to be seen if West Indies pick two bowlers if Russell does not make it to the playing XI.Darren Bravo's steady start and Sunil Narine's boost to the bowling attack were a couple of positives for the tourists, but they will need the rest of the players to stand up and deliver. Andre Fletcher, Johnson Charles, Marlon Samuels, Jonathan Carter, all failed to come good with a bat, and if there is another such disappointing performance from the top-order, West Indies hopes of keeping alive their chances of registering their first bilateral ODI series win in Sri Lanka may be a distant dream.Teams:West Indies (From): Andre Fletcher, Johnson Charles, Darren Bravo, Jonathan Carter, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w/c), Andre Russell, Carlos Brathwaite, Sunil Narine, Jerome Taylor, Ravi Rampaul, Jason Mohammed, Jermaine Blackwood, Devendra BishooSri Lanka (From): Kusal Perera(w), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Shehan Jayasuriya, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Milinda Siriwardana, Sachithra Senanayake, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Suranga Lakmal, Danushka Gunathilaka, Dushmantha Chameera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Jeffrey VandersayLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
