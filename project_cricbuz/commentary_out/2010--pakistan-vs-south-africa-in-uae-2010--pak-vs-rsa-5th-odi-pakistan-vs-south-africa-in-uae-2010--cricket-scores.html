Stay tuned for the toss and the team info....by Vishaal LoganathanThe series could not have been set up more beautifully. The way the Proteas started with an 8 wicket win, almost everyone (including most of Pakistan's ardent fans) would have expected them to steamroll the Pakistanis in the next four matches. Pakistan desperately needed a shot in the arm, and it came thanks to a blinder from Abdul Razzaq in the 2nd ODI.The miraculous victory egged Pakistan on and they stepped up to the plate and ensured their team fought tooth and nail till the very end in the next 2 matches. Pakistan will go in with confidence having pulled off another thrilling win in the last match, while South Africa will want to iron out their mistakes from the last game and clinch the seriesPakistanThe Pakistanis showed tremendous character to fight till the very end and were rewarded with a series leveling victory in the 4th ODI. Most of their batsmen chipped in with useful runs while also staying abreast with the asking rate to help them clinch it at the very end. They would however want one of their batsmen to capitalize on his start and go on to make a significant contribution.Younis Khan was the only Pak batsmen to cross the 50 run mark in the 4th ODI, and his presence and experience in the Pakistan middle order has worked well for the team.Shoaib Akthar has been in good form in this series and has taken the responsibility of spearheading the Pak attack well with wickets. He has also been supported well by the likes of Hafeez and Afridi. South AfricaSouth Africa will be disappointed with having ended up on the losing side twice in the last 3 matches. The return of quickie, Dale Steyn too turned out to be disappointing as the fast bowler went for far too many runs. Morne Morkel was the best South African bowler in the 4th ODI and his figures of 3 for 48 helped RSA almost pull off a victory. On the batting front, the return to form of captain Graeme Smith who scored 92 to help the Proteas post 274, would have brought some smiles in the dressing room. With Hashim Amla in the middle of a purple patch, the Proteas can rely on the duo to give them a good start. Their middle order too has performed well and the entire team look a well oiled unit. With all to play for in the decider, both teams will want all their players to give it all they've got to ensure their team emerges victorious. The teams will be looking forward to the decider with nervous anticipation and if the last 3 matches were anything to go by, we're in for another nerve-wracking game.Teams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Farhat, Younis Khan, Asad Shafiq, Fawad Alam, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Zulqarnain Haider(w), Wahab Riaz, Shoaib Akhtar, Misbah-ul-Haq, Saeed Ajmal, Shahzaib Hasan, Tanvir Ahmed, Umar Akmal, Umar GulSouth Africa (From): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, David Miller, Johan Botha, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Juan Theron, Albie Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Charl LangeveldtLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
