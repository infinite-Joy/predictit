INDIA:48.6 Faulkner to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, Ishant has the task of somehow managing 26 from the last over, sloppy cricket from RJ, but one can't really blame him.

This was full and just outside off, Umesh went for the big heave-ho, gets a lot of height but not the distance.

INDIA:47.1 Mitchell Marsh to U Yadav, no run, another swing and a miss, this is not happening for Umesh, it's not happening for India either. Full and just outside off, Umesh backs away for the swing and missesMitchell Marsh [8.0-0-52-0] is back into the attackLooks like Mitchell Marsh is down with cramps, he aborted his delivery stride, held his left leg and collapsed.

A nothing shot at all, short of a length and holding its line outside off, Bhuvneshwar offers a limp bat and offers catching practice to Smith at first slip.

INDIA:41.5 Kane Richardson to Rahane, out Caught by Smith!! That is a strange dismissal. Credit to Smith and co. for turning this around dramatically. How close was the man at slip there? I tell you what, that is the key to this dismissal. Had he been at a normal position, this wouldn't have carried. Full delivery outside off stump, Rahane opens the face of the bat and tries to run it down to third man but guides it straight to slip. It was a good low catch too.

Marsh moved to his right at backward square leg and swallowed it easily. I can't believe my eyes! From 277/1, it's 286/5. What would one say? Great bowling from Australia or bad batting from India?

It takes just one moment for things to change and the Aussies are nicely turning it on. Nothing shot from Kohli and he can't believe that he's gifted his wicket away. Nothing but a length delivery on the stumps, Kohli advances and for some reason checks his shot, it flew in the air and mid-off ran forward and dived to take a good catch. Kohli slowly trudges off as the crowd gives him a standing ovation. Kohli c Smith b Kane Richardson 106(92) [4s-11 6s-1]Kane Richardson to Kohli, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Kane Richardson [6.0-0-52-1] is back into the attackIndia need 71 off 66.

The Indians were cruising and all of a sudden, the pressure is back on them. I can see a lot of belief in those Aussie players now. This is an excellent Test for this slightly inexperienced batting line-up. Let's see how it goes! Coming back to the ball, it was the slower ball from Hastings, the leg-cutter in fact, Dhoni advanced and pushed at it, the ball just left him and took the outside edge, which carried to the keeper at a good height.

INDIA:35.1 Hastings to Kohli, 2 runs, after missing out on a hundred at the WACA, he told Wasim Akram that he'll score two hundreds in the series and he's kept his word. What a champion! Hundred number 25 in ODIs. Back-to-back hundreds for him as well. Put him in a big run chase and he hardly fails. Short of a length delivery outside off stuump, Kohli steps out and tries to loft, but gets it on the bottom of the bat, the ball clears the infield and lands safely at sweeper cover. Kohli takes the helmet off, raises his bat and acknowledges the applause from the dressing room and the crowd. Dhawan gives him a hug as wellIt's drinks time again. So India have got to a perfect start and it looks all but over for Australia. Kohli and Dhawan will be the key. Let's see what unfolds in the final 15 overs...

No-one seemed convinced and in the end the right decision was madeOh! What happened there? Bailey is claiming the catch. Did it carry? The umpires have gone upstairs. It was a legal delivery.

Lyon will open the attackSome tactics from Smith. Lyon will open the bowling.. He has a slip in place.Welcome back. India made 309, 308 and 295 in the first three matches, can they now overhaul 348? They are all but a batsman short, Rahane will bat only if needed - and the diminutive right-hander was in excellent form.Here's a bit on Rahane - who went off injured during Australia's innings: Vishaal says that he's had four stitches on his right hand but will bat if needed.Mitchell Marsh, the designated No.3 today, struggled to get going while Smith walked out, milked India all around and fell after getting to a fifty off 27 balls. India pleasantly surprised in the last few overs with agility and slower balls to keep Australia from piling up a 400+ mammoth score. Ishant and Umesh ended up with wickets in the kitty while Rishi Dhawan and Jadeja held the run-tap tight despite going wicketless. Maxwell blasted Ishant for an 18-run last over to peg India back but the visitors will believe. Because this is something way short of what it once threatened to be. Join us in about 18:30 local for the chase.Australia, bored of chasing totals and winning, opted to bat on another road at Canberra. Ashwin's mysterious absence continued and Sran's struggles meant a return for lackluster Bhuvneshwar who had already been dropped earlier in the series. The start was a horror, with Warner swinging his bat on return and Finch sedately giving him the strike back. Ishant Sharma was brought on to arrest the run flow but could do that only for a while. The score zoomed to 145/0 at the 25-over mark and things looked ominous for India. Warner fell to Ishant ultimately but not before making a fifty and Aaron Finch stroked to his century before giving it away.4
AUSTRALIA:49.6 Ishant to Maxwell, out Caught by (sub)M Pandey!! Fine catch. To end the innings. Manish Pandey is one of India's best fielders and at square leg he dives full-length to his right to catch with both hands. Short and Maxwell mistimed the pull, was a bit hurried on the shot and couldn't get the elevation to clear the fielder. Manish in the floppy takes a good catch and that's the end of the innings. 18 off the final over and a wicket to end it off. Maxwell c (sub)M Pandey b Ishant 41(20) [4s-6 6s-1]Ishant to Maxwell, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:49.5 Ishant to Maxwell, FOUR, now over mid-off. Not well-timed but enough to clear the fielder inside the ring. Fullish and Maxwell went through the line, can't see Ishant's reaction there. Didn't notice any lip that time. Or I may have missed something. The action is too frenetic for my fingers
AUSTRALIA:49.4 Ishant to Maxwell, no run, and more lip from Ishant. Follows Maxwell with a slower delivery, Maxwell swings and misses. Ishant has a few choice words to say to the batsman. Get back to your mark and bowl, Ishant! This sledging will only make Maxwell go hard at the bowler
AUSTRALIA:49.3 Ishant to Maxwell, FOUR, and make that four more. Full on the stumps, Maxwell makes room and carves it over cover, sliced it in fact but he hit the gap. The sweeper was too wide and he had no chance. Ishant doesn't like it and vents his frustration out. Not sure what he is aiming for. He has been hit for 14 off 3 and he decides to give some lip. Maxwell meanwhile continues on his merry ways
AUSTRALIA:49.2 Ishant to Maxwell, FOUR, and almost on cue. Maxwell goes for the reverse sweep and connects beautifully. Full outside off, third man was inside the ring and he used his hands quite well to hit it over the fielder. Nearly carried all the way. How does he do it so effortlessly? Only he will know
AUSTRALIA:49.1 Ishant to Maxwell, SIX, what is Ishant bowling here? Short and begging to be hit. Maxwell got inside the line and murdered a pull over fine leg. Sailed over the fielder. Didn't get the short ball high, was asking to be hit and Maxwell obliged. Maxwell won't let up here. What will he do next?
AUSTRALIA:48.6 U Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run, sensible from Maxwell. He could've slammed that full toss over cover, instead wants the strike and softly pats it to cover to retain strike
AUSTRALIA:48.5 U Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR, four more. Full toss outside off and Maxwell swings hard and to the deep square leg fence. Had to hit the gap and he did so easily
AUSTRALIA:48.4 U Yadav to Maxwell, FOUR, there goes Maxwell. Shuffles across outside off and paddles a full delivery outside off to the fine leg fence. Got it over short fine and that was enoughJohn Hastings, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:48.3 U Yadav to Wade, out Wade Run Out!! Wade has gone for a nothing run and given it away. Pushed to point, he set off, Rohit threw it on the bounce to the bowler, who back-tracked and collected the throw before lunging out to disturb the stumps. Wade wasn't even in the picture. Simple stuff. Wade run out (Rohit/U Yadav) 0(2)U Yadav to Wade, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
AUSTRALIA:48.2 U Yadav to Wade, leg byes, 2 runs, short of length down leg, Wade flicks and misses, off the thigh pad and down to fine leg, great running by Wade as he raced back and put in the full-length dive to make it back. Umesh was there to collect the throw and had there been a direct hit, Wade would've been gone. The throw came on the bounce and that allowed Wade to get homeMatthew Wade, left handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:48.1 U Yadav to Faulkner, out Bowled!! Two in two for India. Faulkner goes for a golden duck. Back of the hand slower delivery, Umesh released that well, Faulkner was early into the leg-side swipe, a thin inside edge and it kisses the leg stump. Enough for the bail to fall off. Faulkner b U Yadav 0(1)U Yadav to Faulkner, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!James Faulkner, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:47.6 Ishant to Bailey, out Caught by Rohit!! Full toss and Bailey has holed out to long-on. Good catch by Rohit as he had ground to cover and held on with both hands. Bailey hit it flat but not wide of the fielder. That should've been sent to the stands. Ishant must count himself lucky there. India getting some cheap wickets late in the innings. Bailey c Rohit b Ishant 10(7)Ishant to Bailey, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:47.5 Ishant to Bailey, 2 runs, and again. But he takes a tumble after delivering the ball. Nothing alarming though. He is up on his feet. Very full on the stumps, bunted past the bowler and since it isn't timed that well, easy two on offer
AUSTRALIA:47.4 Ishant to Maxwell, 1 run, that's the ball to be bowling at this stage of the innings. On a yorker length and into the blockhole, follows Maxwell who was making room, dug out into the off-side. Maxwell can't get under that and Ishant got it spot on there
AUSTRALIA:47.3 Ishant to Bailey, 3 runs, Gurkeerat on the slide at fine leg, gets a bad bounce and fumbles, nearly allows the ball to sneak through but manages to pull it back and prevent the boundary. That fumble turns what would've been a two into a third
AUSTRALIA:47.2 Ishant to Maxwell, leg byes, 1 run, much better. Full and aiming the pads of Maxwell, he swings and misses. Is hit on the leg and he hobbles towards the other end. They take a leg-bye
AUSTRALIA:47.1 Ishant to Maxwell, FOUR, the third man is up and it is a horrid delivery from Ishant, dug in short on the stumps, Maxwell makes room and swings hard, the thick top edge carries over the fielder and dribbles away into the ropes. Not the kind of delivery to be bowling when the field is set like that
AUSTRALIA:46.6 U Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run, fine yorker from Umesh. Maxwell can do nothing, but toe-end it towards mid-wicket. Good enough to get the single. Maxwell was shuffling across and aiming for the leg-side, but Umesh kept him quiet
AUSTRALIA:46.5 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, another off-speed delivery outside off, Bailey waits for it and cuts it to sweeper cover, just a single as it is straight to the fielder
AUSTRALIA:46.4 U Yadav to Bailey, 2 runs, back of the hand slower delivery, sits up to be hit, Bailey carves it over point for a couple
AUSTRALIA:46.3 U Yadav to Bailey, no run, full outside off, Bailey swings and misses. Wanted to go over cover, but missed out
AUSTRALIA:46.2 U Yadav to Bailey, 2 runs, full on the stumps, flicked in the air, but wide of the man at square leg, they come back for the second
AUSTRALIA:46.1 U Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run, offie on the stumps, shortish, Maxwell makes room and slaps it to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:45.6 Ishant to Maxwell, 1 run, full and following Maxwell, he makes room and slugs it to deep mid-wicket, for a single
AUSTRALIA:45.5 Ishant to Maxwell, 2 runs, backs away and looks to drill it to long-off, it isn't timed well and that's why he can come back for the secondGeorge Bailey, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:45.4 Ishant to Smith, out Caught by Gurkeerat Singh!! Smith falls without making a hundred. But he has done his job. I wrote the first sentence for added effect, because whenever I have done a match involving these two sides, there is only one inevitability and that's a Smith hundred. Such a boring routine that. But this time Smith falls trying to up the ante. It was a length delivery and Smith on the shuffle, leading-edged the flick, towards deep backward square leg, Gurkeerat kept his eyes on the ball and went back to hang onto the swirler. It wasn't an easy catch but he made it look simple. Smith was a tad early on the shot and that's why got the leading edge. Smith c Gurkeerat Singh b Ishant 51(29) [4s-4 6s-3]Ishant to Smith, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:45.3 Ishant to Maxwell, 1 run, now goes deep in his crease and shuffles across slightly to whip the fullish delivery through mid-wicket. All along the ground
AUSTRALIA:45.2 Ishant to Maxwell, 2 runs, another slower delivery following the backing away Maxwell, he mistimes the big hit. But the mistiming proves to be a blessing for Maxwell as the ball dribbles towards long-on. They hurry back for the second
AUSTRALIA:45.2 Ishant to Maxwell, wide, Ishant tries to follow the backing away Maxwell, but misdirects the slower delivery down leg, Maxwell swipes and misses, wide called and Mahendra Singh Dhoni does well to stop it with his pads as it bounced in front of him
AUSTRALIA:45.1 Ishant to Maxwell, no run, Maxwell makes room and looks to go over cover, but the pacy length ball rises over his blade and settles into Mahendra Singh Dhoni's mitts. Had he connected that, would've gone over cover or if he had got an edge, would've flown over the keeper. But he missedIshant Sharma [7.0-0-42-1] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:44.6 U Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run, slower delivery outside off, Maxwell waits for it and pushes it to point, for a single
AUSTRALIA:44.5 U Yadav to Smith, 1 run, low full toss and it is whipped to deep backward square leg, for a single
AUSTRALIA:44.4 U Yadav to Smith, FOUR, the Aussie Open is on and Smith wouldn't be out of place playing there. He would make a fine Tennis player. Tom Moody on air mentions that Smith played a bit of Tennis when he was younger. That proves my theory right. And this shot is right out of the Tennis manual. A forehand slap over point. Short and outside off, Smith thundered it with lots of power and it almost went all the way, one bounce over the ropes. He continues to amaze usGlenn Maxwell, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:44.3 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, out Caught by Kohli!! Swiped high in the air and the top edge is caught by Kohli at long-on. Another well-disguised slower delivery outside off, Mitchell Marsh was on his knees, eyeing the mid-wicket fence, but the slowness of the delivery defeated his stroke and he could only find long-on. Kohli came forward and took it sliding on his knees. Big wicket for Mitchell Marsh could've been very destructive at the death. Mitchell Marsh c Kohli b U Yadav 33(42) [4s-3]U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!For Mitchell Marsh fine leg is inside the circle
AUSTRALIA:44.2 U Yadav to Smith, 1 run, slower delivery outside off, no pace for Smith to work with, swiped to deep backward square legFine leg goes back
AUSTRALIA:44.1 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, very full outside off, Mitchell Marsh reached out and got an inside edge to short fine, Smith crosses overUmesh Yadav [7.0-1-43-1] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:43.6 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, no run, Bhuvneshwar does well, keeps his wits about him as Smith shuffled well outside off, follows the batsman and Smith swings, doesn't connect, off the pad and Mahendra Singh Dhoni takes it
AUSTRALIA:43.5 Bhuvneshwar to Mitchell Marsh, leg byes, 1 run, Bhuvneshwar follows the backing away Mitchell Marsh, into the body, a swing and a miss, off the pad and it is a leg-bye
AUSTRALIA:43.4 Bhuvneshwar to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, short of length and Mitchell Marsh stands tall and flat-bats it to long-off. Umesh is once again a bit lax and allows the second. Mahendra Singh Dhoni isn't happy with him
AUSTRALIA:43.3 Bhuvneshwar to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, short of length on the stumps, Mitchell Marsh is cramped on the big shot, gets forward and swipes it through mid-wicket. Comes back for the second
AUSTRALIA:43.2 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, 1 run, back of a length outside off, punched to point, quick single
AUSTRALIA:43.1 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, SIX, rubbish delivery and easy for Smith. High full toss outside off, needed a solid connection and Smith flicked it in the air, helped it over deep backward square leg, just about six and that will do nicely. India don't seem to learn. Everytime they start the over with a freebie and the batsmen have a head-start first upBhuvneshwar Kumar [7.0-0-58-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:42.6 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, bottom hand power! That strong bottom hand of Mitchell Marsh coming into play. It was fullish on the stumps, he whipped it in the air and the ball sped off the turf, if it has beaten Kohli's dive at long-on, then it must be a fine shot and no doubt it was. Kohli sprinted and put in the full-length dive, but the ball had too much pace and zip to elude his grasp
AUSTRALIA:42.5 Ishant to Smith, 1 run, shuffles across and mistimes the pull to deep backward square leg, just a single
AUSTRALIA:42.4 Ishant to Smith, no run, Smith isn't happy that it hasn't been given a wide. While Ishant gives some lip to the Aussie captain. Had Smith not attempted a reverse hit, that would've been called a wide as it was down leg, since the umpire assumed that he was batting as a left-hander, he didn't call it. Fair enough! Ishant didn't like the shot attempted by Smith and vented out his frustration
AUSTRALIA:42.3 Ishant to Smith, 2 runs, good length on the stumps, flicked to fine leg, it is well wide of the fielder and an easy couple that time
AUSTRALIA:42.2 Ishant to Smith, 2 runs, low full toss and it is whipped to deep backward square leg, a fumble from the fielder and it is two. Sloppy once more from the IndiansNow Ishant round the wicket
AUSTRALIA:42.1 Ishant to Smith, SIX, woah! Nothing delivery from Ishant, a fullish delivery outside off, Smith went deep in his crease and slammed it miles back over mid-wicket. The crowd might need helmets at this rate. Smith shuffled across slightly and gave it his all. That shuffle gave him the room to free his armsIshant Sharma [6.0-0-27-1] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:41.6 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, sloppy from Umesh that time, he allows the second at long-off. Dozed off for a moment, assuming it was just a single after Mitchell Marsh belted the full toss towards him, Mitchell Marsh and Smith spotted the chance and ran back for the second
AUSTRALIA:41.5 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, smashed to the left of Dhawan, good job that it missed the left-shin of Dhawan, had it hit him on the leg, he would've been another casualty on a day when the umpire has already copped one. Umesh covered good ground from long-off, dived and saved the boundary
AUSTRALIA:41.4 R Dhawan to Smith, 1 run, fullish on the stumps, Smith gets forward and eases a drive to long-on
AUSTRALIA:41.3 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, length on the stumps, Mitchell Marsh stands tall and biffs it to deep mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:41.2 R Dhawan to Smith, 1 run, shortish outside off, carved to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:41.1 R Dhawan to Smith, FOUR, has Umesh pulled it back? Or is his foot touching the ad-cushion? It is the latter. Smith uses his feet and lofts it wide of long-off. Umesh covered ground and slid to his left, but his back leg was touching the cushion as he pulled the ball back. The third umpire has a look and adjudges it as a four. Bad start by Rishi
AUSTRALIA:40.6 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, leg byes, 1 run, down leg, Smith swings and misses, deflects off the pad and to the left of the keeper. They take a leg-bye
AUSTRALIA:40.5 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, no run, length on off, whipped powerfully, but straight to the fielder at mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:40.4 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, 2 runs, slower delivery on or around off, Smith nurdles it to fine leg, gets it in the gap and it is two
AUSTRALIA:40.3 Bhuvneshwar to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, short of length outside off, Mitchell Marsh flat-bats it to long-off, just a single
AUSTRALIA:40.2 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, 1 run, back of a length outside off, wristed to deep square leg
AUSTRALIA:40.1 Bhuvneshwar to Smith, SIX, "baby six" calls Harsha Bhogle on air and he sums it aptly. Length outside off and Smith just wristed it over mid-wicket, lots of bottom hand on that stroke and for a moment he looked like he had holed out. Went with the slight breeze and teased Shikhar at deep mid-wicket all the way before clearing him. He leapt to try and take it, but it kept going over his head and went all the way. What timing on that!Bhuvneshwar Kumar [6.0-0-48-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:39.6 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, no run, a wild hack across the line from Mitchell Marsh and he doesn't connect. Slower one outside off, Mitchell Marsh misses and so does Mahendra Singh Dhoni standing up
AUSTRALIA:39.5 R Dhawan to Smith, 3 runs, has been an assortment of slower deliveries in this over, Smith rolls his wrists on the flick and beats Gurkeerat inside the circle at short fine, there isn't much timing, so even though he is ambling along, he slides to save a run. They come back for the third
AUSTRALIA:39.4 R Dhawan to Smith, no run, slower delivery outside off, wristed to the left of Kohli at mid-wicket, a diving stop made
AUSTRALIA:39.3 R Dhawan to Smith, FOUR, Smith gets outside off and reads the slower delivery, didn't time it as well as he would've liked to but got it wide of Gurkeerat at short fine, he went back and slid, but carried the ball along with him to the ropes. All that effort gone waste
AUSTRALIA:39.2 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, Mitchell Marsh winds up for a big hit, but this is another off-speed delivery, slammed to long-on
AUSTRALIA:39.1 R Dhawan to Mitchell Marsh, no run, length on the stumps, punched to mid-wicketRishi Dhawan [7.0-0-34-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:38.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, FOUR, and now gets four. Comes down the track and takes it on the full, flicked through mid-wicket, beats deep mid-wicket, again the fielder there is very slow, the ball wasn't travelling that quickly as well. Should've made a better fist of it
AUSTRALIA:38.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, no run, what happened there? Smith is on all fours. Got outside off and tried to sweep, the front foot slipped while he was attempting the stroke, landed awkwardly and fortunately didn't do himself any damage. So easily could've twisted his groin there. Is up on his feet quickly though
AUSTRALIA:38.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Mitchell Marsh mistimes the drive to the left of the bowler, Ravindra Jadeja should've stopped that, but he let it go, didn't dive. Very sloppy from him, usually he is very good off his own bowling
AUSTRALIA:38.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, 1 run, backs away and crunches a drive to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:38.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, no run, on the stumps, Smith gets forward and flicks to mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:38.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, flat and on the stumps, wristed with lots of bottom-hand to mid-on
AUSTRALIA:37.6 U Yadav to Smith, no run, fullish outside off, driven straight to the fielder at cover
AUSTRALIA:37.5 U Yadav to Smith, no run, Smith is beaten first ball. On a good length and outside off, straightens past the nervy poke of Smith who was shuffling across to defend. That was a good nut
AUSTRALIA:37.4 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, gets forward and drives wide of mid-off for a quick singleSteven Smith, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:37.3 U Yadav to Finch, out Caught by Ishant!! So nearly a comedy of errors. But Ishant at mid-on hangs on and then has a few words to say to his Delhi mate Kohli who was running back from mid-wicket. It was short and outside off, hurried Finch on the pull, he miscued it in the air and for a while it looked like both Kohli and Ishant will make a mess of it. It was always Ishant's catch as he was running towards the ball, Kohli realised that he wasn't going to get there and left it to the big man. Ishant was nervy for a moment as his peripheral vision saw Kohli, but he did well to take it with both hands. After taking the catch, Ishant had something to say to Kohli, who laughed it off. Found the incident funny. Anyway a fine innings from Finch comes to an end. He walks off to a standing ovation. Finch c Ishant b U Yadav 107(107) [4s-9 6s-2]U Yadav to Finch, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:37.3 U Yadav to Finch, wide, short and down leg, Finch swivels on the pull and misses. That's the problem with Yadav, he can't string together a decent set. After two good deliveries, he bowls one down leg
AUSTRALIA:37.2 U Yadav to Finch, no run, another delivery that causes Finch some trouble. Fullish and tailing in, Finch drives and gets an inside edge onto the pad. The ball rolls to the off-side
AUSTRALIA:37.1 U Yadav to Finch, no run, extra bounce from a back of a length for Yadav, beats Finch's attempt at a cut. That was a good delivery
AUSTRALIA:36.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, 1 run, now cuts to the right of point, Mitchell Marsh is quick and they hare across for a quick single
AUSTRALIA:36.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, no run, that was close! Must say on a second glance at the replay, Finch is a lucky man to be staying on the crease. Didn't get outside the line of off, as he knelt down to sweep a flat and quick delivery, it was around off and middle and he missed the shot. Would've gone onto hit the stumps. Ravindra Jadeja and Mahendra Singh Dhoni belted out a huge appeal but the umpire was unmoved. No inside edge on the pad as well. It wasn't turning as well. Finch is very lucky
AUSTRALIA:36.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, no run, backs away and finds point with a mistimed cut
AUSTRALIA:36.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, now gets forward and drills a drive to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:36.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, there comes the slog-sweep. On his knees and timed the shot beautifully, even though the length was flat and the delivery was quick, Marsh got enough wood and it was a flat hit over mid-wicket, one bounce over the ropes. He is a powerful bloke and when he hits it, it usually stays hit
AUSTRALIA:36.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, no run, Mitchell Marsh uses his feet, but isn't to the pitch of the ball, finds short cover
AUSTRALIA:35.6 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, short of length on the stumps, whipped to deep backward square leg, he will retain strike
AUSTRALIA:35.5 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, no run, that splice-jarring length from Yadav, Mitchell Marsh takes the bottom hand off the bat as he punches towards mid-off
AUSTRALIA:35.4 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, no run, Yadav pulls his length back and forces Mitchell Marsh to defend off the back foot
AUSTRALIA:35.3 U Yadav to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, Mitchell Marsh goes over mid-off and gets four. Pitched up and he lofted it clean and straight. Easily done. Almost all the way
AUSTRALIA:35.2 U Yadav to Finch, 1 run, just in front of Gurkeerat at short fine. Flicked airily and Gurkeerat did well to get his body behind the line of the ball as he dived to his left. Had that gone past him, it would've been four
AUSTRALIA:35.1 U Yadav to Finch, FOUR, rank bad ball and Finch is in no mood to let that go. Short and sat up to be hit. Finch rocked back and crunched the pull to deep mid-wicket, beat the fielder easily. The man had a few paces to move to his left but he had no chance. Not the start that India would've hoped for right after the drinks break. Yadav needs to get his act rightTime for a drink. Plenty of action! Warner missed out on his hundred while Finchy helped himself to a well-compiled hundred. The onus is on Indian bowlers now. How much will Australia score? With 9 wickets in hand, I reckon they might well make a score above 350. Here's Srivathsa to take you through till the end of the Aussie innings...
AUSTRALIA:34.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Mitchell Marsh, no run, darted in on leg, Marsh makes room and drives to short straight mid-off, Manish dives to his right to prevent a single

AUSTRALIA:33.3 U Yadav to Finch, 1 run, 7th ODI ton for Finch! He might be the happiest man in Canberra right now. Jumps high in the air, pumps his fist and waves his bat to the audience, what an innings this has been. He gets there with a flick to mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:33.2 U Yadav to Finch, no run, back of a length outside off, punched to cover
AUSTRALIA:33.1 U Yadav to Finch, FOUR, ah, shot! Short and asking to be put away. Finch acknowledges the offer as he jumps back and finds the gap behind square leg with a well-timed pull strokeUmesh Yadav [4.0-1-26-0] is back into the attack"Kettleborough unlikely to officiate again in this game. Swelling in leg and in some discomfort. Hasn't been taken to a hospital, but they're monitoring him here," is the latest on the English umpire.

AUSTRALIA:29.4 Ishant to Mitchell Marsh, no run, stifled appeal straightaway! This snaked in from a length and hit Marsh on the pads. Was a bit high and might have missed leg clearlyMitchell Marsh, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:29.3 Ishant to Warner, out Bowled!! Knocked 'em over. Ishant is a happy man. He certainly has looked the best of the lot and deservedly gets a wicket, that too of the big man. Bowls a length delivery and lures Warner into a false stroke. Warner has decided to slog this over mid-wicket. Gets a thick bottom edge which disturbs the furniture. Warner b Ishant 93(92) [4s-12 6s-1]Ishant to Warner, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
AUSTRALIA:29.2 Ishant to Finch, 1 run, tap-and-run cricket from the Aussies - how many times have we seen that today? Finch drops this length delivery in front of his eyes and scampers acrossVirat is seen having a casual break munching on some chocolate. Should be back on pretty soon
AUSTRALIA:29.2 Ishant to Finch, wide, down leg and the umpire starts to exercise his arms
AUSTRALIA:29.1 Ishant to Finch, FOUR, poor stuff from Ishant! Bowls it fuller and on Finch's pads. He gets across and flicks nicely, finds the gap through short fineVishaal, who is at the ground, pings me this update: "Few dark clouds around, and wind, too. Rain might be around the corner." Also, Rahane, who split his webbing earlier, has been taken to the hospital for stitches.
AUSTRALIA:28.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Warner, no run, the batsman's changed but the line isn't. On leg-stump again, Warner clips but finds short fine

AUSTRALIA:27.6 Ishant to Finch, 2 runs, phew! Ishant is livid! He is certainly not happy with the fielders. Lets out a loud yell of ****** frustration. Rishi Dhawan is the fielder as my colleague Srivathsa points out. This was full and straight and Finch flicked through mid-wicket, good running takes care of the rest
AUSTRALIA:27.5 Ishant to Finch, no run, back of a length angled in, Finch rises on his toes to punch, ends up chopping it off the inside edge onto his thigh pad
AUSTRALIA:27.4 Ishant to Warner, 1 run, another slower delivery from Ishant, but not the perfect line to be bowling at. On and around leg-stump and Warner can handle that any day, milks a single down to long-on
AUSTRALIA:27.3 Ishant to Finch, 1 run, sat up on a length for Finchy to bunt a single down to long-on. The fielder at mid-wicket was a tad too deep and hence he couldn't prevent the single

There are two more games to go, it's a learning curve, the youngsters will get better for the experience.Smith: We will bat. It's pretty warm, looks like a good wicket, slows up later on. Nathan Lyon and David Warner are back, they replace Scott Boland and Shaun Marsh. Maxwell was calm and composed the other night, we are looking for more such performances from him in future.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Rishi Dhawan, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Umesh YadavAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, Kane Richardson, John Hastings, Nathan LyonAustralia have won the toss and have opted to batWord-to-word compilation of raillery between Kohli and Faulkner from the last game (heard from the stump mic).Kohli: You're wasting your energy. There's no pointFaulkner: Having fun are we?Kohli: I've smashed you enough in my life. No Point. Just go and bowl.Faulkner: Smiles! (as he trundles back to his bowling crease)Till we update you with the toss, here's something you can have a squint at. I bet, it'd be worthwhile.Meanwhile, here's what our correspondent Vishaal Loganathan has to report from the ground: "It's bright and sunny out there. Ashwin and Jadeja were bowling early, so India could go in with two spinners."Adding to the team changes, Nathan Lyon the current best Australian spinner, might play his first ODI in 16 months, at the expense of Scott Boland. For India, MSD would be tempted to bring Bhuvneshwar back in place of the impressive left-arm pacer Barinder Sran who has had a nightmare in the last game. Ashwin will most probably replace Rishi Dhawan and Axar Patel could well get a game. The Indian captain, however, likes to play his cards close to his chest. Let's see what unfolds when he steps out for the toss, which is a few moments away from now...First up, David Warner returns from paternity leave, and will regain his place in the side meaning Shaun Marsh might well have to face the axe. Although Marsh took full advantage of the opportunity, the chances of him being selected seem highly unlikely. Tells us something regarding the competitiveness, ain't it? Speaking of competitiveness, India failed to compete with the mighty Aussies in all 3 departments. Although batting wasn't singled out much, many critics lamented the lacklustre approach of Indian batting in the middle overs. Let's see if India can put that myth to bed tonight.12:25 Local Time, 02:25 GMT, 07:55 IST: Greetings all! Remember Maxwell's massacre at the MCG? Just a day before the season's first Grand Slam tournament (Australian Open) began in Melbourne - Maxi lit his hometown with a blazing, bravado knock to seal the series for his country. I'm pretty sure a few tennis stars might have been mesmerised by Maxi's flat-bat biffs and forearm strokes. That was that on Sunday. Let's shift our focus to 410 miles away from Melbourne which is the Australian capital Canberra. We saw scores of 309, 308 and 295 being chased down with ease. So, what's the safe target these days? Maybe India should score the amount of distance they travelled (in miles) to reach Canberra. I still suspect if that would be enough.Preview by Vishaal LoganathanIn a little less than three years, the Manuka Oval at Canberra has played host to five One-Day Internationals. On Wednesday (January 20), it will see its sixth, as Australia face off against India for the fourth game of the five-match one-day series. Of the five games, the teams have crossed 250 eight times, 300 four times, and 400 once. If there were any doubts that the ongoing Australia-India series would finally start to veer towards the bowling side, those stats should clamp those doubts shut emphatically. If it hasn't, then this is the ground where a player (Chris Gayle) scored the first double hundred in the men's Cricket World Cup.Although the match is primed to be another high-scorer, what will interest both teams in how the toss goes. Australia have won three back-to-back games while chasing down record scores at the WACA, the Gabba and the MCG. But history dictates that the team batting first at the Manuka Oval stands the best chance of victory. There has been no successful chase in Canberra since February 2008 when Sri Lanka beat India in a rain-marred game.Australia are already 3-0 up, and the series trophy is in their bag. India, on the other hand, have flattered to deceive thus far. A five-nil drubbing beckons the 2011 World Champions, and they will want to ensure they do everything they can to stem the rot.Match DetailsDate and Time: January 20, 2016; 14:20 Local Time, 08:50 ISTWeather: 35 degrees with a slight chance of rainVenue: Manuka OvalTeam Details:Australia: Australia have the luxury of choosing two among three top-class openers for the game in Canberra. David Warner returned to camp following the birth of his second child, which leave the side having to choose between him, Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh to open the batting. Finch and Warner, Australia's regular opening pair, were at the optional practice session on Tuesday and that could indicate that the pair would start.Marsh has done well when given the chance with fifties in the two games in Warner's absence, and would be unlucky to miss out. He could still make the side if the selectors decide to rest another player in the middle order. George Bailey could most likely be the one to give way should they opt with Marsh.Australia have rotated their bowlers quite effectively through the series and Wednesday could see the same policy continue. Offspinner Nathan Lyon has been included in the line-up, and the big boundaries and the success of slower bowlers in the stadium in the past could push him into the starting XI. Scott Boland has played three games with not much to show for his efforts could make way for the spinner.India: The Indian practice session was an interesting one to watch on Tuesday. Ravindra Jadeja hardly bowled during the entire session and only had a few tweaks when the tail-enders were batting. R Ashwin and Axar Patel, on the other hand, bowled quite a bit. Barinder Sran, too, bowled significantly less compared to Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav and Bhuvenshwar Kumar. Sran was taken for plenty during the game in Melbourne and the pecking order in the nets could indicate the one in tomorrow's match, too.Shikhar Dhawan, despite his flailing form, should still retain his place at the top, while Gurukeerat Singh Mann should be able to keep Manish Pandey on the sidelines with his decent show with the ball in the last game.Quotes:David Warner: It's always good when you get time off from the game, but you don't want to miss too much cricket, because at the end of the day you're giving an opportunity to someone else. That's fantastic, but then you've got to come back and you've got to be switched on and you've got to score runs as well.Ravi Shastri: I think it's a huge learning curve. There is absolutely no shame in the way they have played inspite of the results. Because I know there is only one way to go after this tour of Australia and that's going up.Teams:Australia (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, Kane Richardson, Scott Boland, John Hastings, Shaun Marsh, Nathan LyonIndia (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Rishi Dhawan, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Barinder Sran, Manish Pandey, Ravichandran Ashwin, Axar Patel, Bhuvneshwar KumarLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
