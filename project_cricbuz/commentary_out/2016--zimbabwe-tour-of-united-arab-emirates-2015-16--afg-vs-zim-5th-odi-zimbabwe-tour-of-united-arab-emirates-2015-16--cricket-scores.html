AFGHANISTAN:49.4 49.4Neville Madziva to Naib, SIX, Afghanistan have done it! They win the series 3-2! The team players run towards their hero and hug him in delight.

AFGHANISTAN:49.3 Neville Madziva to Naib, 2 runs, in the blockhole on the stumps, Naib squeezes it in front of long-on and the batsmen come back for the second with ease.

For Zimbabwe, they need 2 wickets or at least the wicket of Naib early in this over. Madziva to bowl the final over. It all comes down to this, the series stands at 2-2. This over will decide the fate of the series. Third man goes back, square leg comes inside the ring. Here we go then...

AFGHANISTAN:47.6 Neville Madziva to Mirwais, out Bowled!! That's a big wicket! Ashraf departs first ball and the Afghan players have their hands on their heads in the dressing room.

Mohammad Shahzad is on strike. Neville Madziva will open the attackThe players are ambling out to the middle and the action is set to resume...The batsmen were playing well up until the 30th over mark, where they were 153/2 at that point. However, the Afghans bowled some really tight lines to put some pressure back on Elton Chigumbura's men. Apart from Masakadza, there were handy cameos from Mutumbami and Raza, but they failed to kick on. In the end, Zimbabwe lost 6 wickets for 28 runs and were bundled out for 248. Can Afghanistan chase this down and win the series? Or will the Zimbabweans continue their march? Join us in a short while to find out.The Zimbabweans have put a decent total on the board, but they would feel that they should have had many more. The Afghans got an early wicket in the form of Chibhabha but they didn't bowl well to Hamilton Masakadza, who was severe on the leggie Rashid early on. Masakadza played out a fluent knock and it was his century that turned out to be the cornerstone of this innings.4
ZIMBABWE:49.5 Amir Hamza to Cremer, out Caught by (sub)Shafiqullah at mid wicket!! That's the end of the Zimbabwean innings. They fall just two short of the 250-mark.

ZIMBABWE:48.5 Dawlat Zadran to Luke Jongwe, out Hit Wkt!! Wooahhh! What happened there? The ball has gone for a six but the batsman is gone. How often do you see something like this? Jongwe kneels down and nails the pull over fine leg off this shortish delivery. However, the followthrough of his bat hits the stumps and dislodges the bails. Rather unfortunate result for the batsman there, but the bowling side won't mind it one bit. Luke Jongwe hit wkt b Dawlat Zadran 2(6)Dawlat Zadran to Luke Jongwe, THAT'S OUT!! Hit Wkt!!

ZIMBABWE:47.3 Rashid Khan to H Masakadza, out Caught by Shahidi!! Another one bites the dust and this time it's the big wicket of Masakadza. He would have been a handful in the final few balls, but Afghanistan are happy to see his back. The umpires check for the bowler's front foot, but he is fine on that count. This was floated up outside off, Masakadza wanted to go inside-out over cover, ends up slicing it high and the fielder at point snaffles it with ease.

Long-off takes a very simple catch to send him on his way back. S Raza c Nawroz b Rashid Khan 29(23) [4s-2 6s-1]Rashid Khan to S Raza, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Raza has been caught here. The umpire's are taking a look whether it was a fair delivery, since it was a high full toss. It should be out as Raza advanced down the track on this occasion. The bowler's front foot is fine as well. The ball was dipping towards him and he was well out of his crease as he made contact. The third umpire rules him OUT

We want to win this game, we have to take wickets early. Hopefully, we will win the decider.'Chigumbura:  'We are going to bat first. We would love to put some runs on the board and put pressure on Afghanistan. We are not changing the winning combination.'Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to batThe buck stops here. After outplaying Zimbabwe in the first two ODIs, Afghanistan lost the plot and lost the next two to give Zimbabwe a shot at winning the series. Hello and welcome to the finale of the 5-match series. It is diffcult to predict who is the favourite today, but the way Zimbabwe have played in the last two ODIs, they definitely have the momentum on their side. Afghanistan, on the other hand, would rue the fact that they had two chances to seal the series but they allowed Zimbabwe to bounce back. It is the consistency that has eluded Ashgar Stanikzai's side for there is no dearth of talent in the team. The contest has been even so far in the series and the order won't change as this promises to be an enthralling affair.
