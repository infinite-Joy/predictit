Afghanistan started and ended well with the ball, but allowed Shakib and Rahim to build a 114-run stand for the fifth wicket - the highest partnership for any wicket for Bangladesh in a World Cup match. That helped Bangladesh post a more than competitive 267 from their allotted 50 overs. Afghanistan's batting is their weaker link. Can they put up a good show and cause a surprise?However, Mohammad Nabi's bowlers came back strongly in the death overs, picking up 6 wickets in the last 6 overs to stem the run flow. Mirwais Ashraf, Aftab Alam, Shapoor Zadran and Hamid Hassan bagged two wickets apiece, but Shapoor was the best of the bowlers as he conceded just 20 runs in his 7 overs. Afghanistan will have to make history today if they are to win this match. This will be their highest succesful run chase against a Test playing nation. Can they do it? We'll find out in a while. Take a break and join us back for Afghanistan's reply.Earlier, after opting to bat, Bangladesh got off to a slow start as the Afghans bowled with great discipline. Mirwais Ashraf removed Tamim Iqbal and ended his 47-run opening stand with Anamul Haque in the 14th over. Mirwais dismissed Anamul soon to put a bit of pressure on Bangladesh. Soumya Sarkar and Mahmudullah steadied the ship with a brisk fifty-run stand before both went in quick succession. The experienced duo of Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim then recorded Bangladesh's highest ever World Cup stand (114) to swing the pendulum in their favour.Bangladesh have lost 5 wickets for 34 runs in the last 5 overs. When Shakib and Rahim were going great guns, it looked like 280-290 was a certainty, but Afghanistan's death bowling was great and Bangladesh couldn't keep the momentum going.4
BANGLADESH:49.6 Aftab Alam to Taskin Ahmed, out Bowled!! This is a strong finish from Afghanistan.

He's well in.

Anamul is on strike. Hamid will open the attackRight, the anthems are over. The Afghanis are in the middle of the team huddle. Hamid Hassan, their opening bowler, is a contrast, with a head band and the Afghanistan flag painted on his cheeks. He will open the bowling as well.The team anthems are in progress.Afghanistan have won 8 ODIs since January 2014, while Bangladesh, who are ranked ahead of them, have just won 5. Don't count this as a low-key affair.Teams:Afghanistan (Playing XI): Afsar Zazai(w), Javed Ahmadi, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Mirwais Ashraf, Aftab Alam, Shapoor Zadran, Hamid HassanBangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Soumya Sarkar, Rubel Hossain, Taskin AhmedBangladesh have won the toss and have opted to batMashrafe Mortaza: "First match is very important for everyone. It has been set up nicely. Hopefully we will do well today. We will bat first. It looks to be a very good track and hopefully we will make a good total. No changes to our side."Mohammad Nabi: "This is our World Cup and it is very exciting. Everyone is fit and hopefully we will do well in the tournament. We have three fast bowlers in our side. Hopefully the ball will reverse after 25 overs and hopefully we will chase a low total."Pitch Report: "It is a fantastic looking pitch, hardly a blade of grass on it. It is very hard and well rolled. We have cracks here and there. There can be a bit of crumbling. 300 would be a good score here and it will be a good chase as well. Afghanistan will compete, I think it will be even stevens (on Afghanistan giving a fight to the Bangladesh batters). Build your innings and maximise the score. Perfect batting pitch. Win the toss and bat first", reckon Russell Arnold and Ramiz Raja.We are just minutes away from the toss and team updates. How will the pitch play? What will be a par score on this track? Answers coming up in a short while.Weather: It is bright and sunny out there and the great news is that there is no forecast of rain during the course of the match. It is currently 27 degrees and the maximum is expected to be around 29 degrees.The story is quite different for Bangladesh though. They lost to Pakistan in their first match and then couldn't conquer Ireland either. This puts a bit of extra pressure on the team, but with world-class players like Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim in their ranks, they don't have to look far ahead for inspiration. The team had an intense three-hour training session at the Manuka Oval a couple of days ago and with coach Chandika Hathurusinghe revealing before the tournament that his side is targetting a place in the quarterfinals, it is quite clear that Bangladesh want to make a statement in their first game.Building up to this game, there is no doubt that the momentum is with the Afghans. Although they went down to India in their first warm-up game, they made sure that India couldn't bowl them out. A few days later, they posted over 300 and held their nerve to edge UAE by 14 runs in their second warm-up fixture. In fact, Afghanistan believe that they have the fast bowlers to exploit the pace and bounce and trouble the Bangladeshi batsmen, most of whom are short.Ever since 2008, the rise of Afghanistan, who are making their World Cup debut, has been great. They were ranked as the top Associate nation just a few days ago, placed 11th in the ICC ODI rankings, ahead of Ireland, Scotland and Kenya. Their journey has been an inspiring story so far, considering that they emerge from a war-torn country.The mind games have already started! Speaking ahead of the match, Afghanistan captain Mohammad Nabi said that Bangladesh are under pressure coming into this contest. Their coach Andy Moles has also said that his side will give a tough fight to Bangladesh. On the other hand, when reminded about Bangladesh's loss at the hands of Afghanistan in the 2014 Asia Cup, captain Mashrafe Mortaza was quick to say that his side was not bothered by the defeat.13:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: It's time for Canberra to join the 2015 World Cup party as the picturesque Manuka Oval gears up to host its second ever World Cup match. We have Bangladesh taking on Afghanistan today in this Group A fixture. Well, these two teams might have the tag of 'minnows', but this contest has all the makings to be an exciting match, especially after Afghanistan's win over Bangladesh in their own backyard last year.Preview:The sleepy town of Canberra will be shaken out of its slumber when the World Cup party reaches the Manuka Oval, which hosts the Pool A fixture between Bangladesh and Afghanistan. They may not be cream of the subcontinent but both teams are capable of putting up eye-catching performances in the hope to make a winning start to their campaign.While Afghanistan make their debut at Canberra and would look to impress, Bangladesh's stay as an ICC Full Member has been filled with disappointments intertwined with the odd success. Mashrafe Mortaza's men would look to invoke their 2007 campaign where they upset India in the tournament opener, and a winning start here would go a long way in boosting their confidence.Venue: Manuka Oval, CanberraDate: February 18Time: 0900 Hrs (IST)Weather: Mostly sunny with a high of 28 degreesTeam newsBangladeshBangladesh lost both their warm-up games in the lead-up to the tournament to Pakistan and Ireland, and their second defeat would have hurt them more. Bangladesh's short batsmen would be wary of Afghanistan's fast bowlers who can generate good pace and bounce and a hard Manuka Oval pitch would assist their kind of bowling.After losing both their warm-up matches, the biggest problem for Bangladesh would be to find the right balance of fast bowlers and spinners, as they are used to playing a slew of spinners on turning pitches at home. Mortaza would need to shepherd a promising but green pace attack with Taskin Ahmed set to partner him, and a battle for the third seamer in Rubel Hossain or Al-Amin Hossain to follow.On the batting front, seniors Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim would be hoping they get solid support from the top order and not let the pressure fall on them to revive the innings.Probable XI: 1. Anamul Haque, 2. Tamim Iqbal, 3. Mominul Haque, 4. Soumya Sarkar/Mahmudullah, 5. Shakib Al Hasan, 6. Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7. Nasir Hossain, 8. Mashrafe Mortaza (capt), 9. Taijul Islam, 10. Taskin Ahmed, 11. Rubel Hossain/Al-Amin Hossain.AfghanistanAfghanistan don't consider themselves to be the giant killers that a team like Ireland can turn out to be, but they sure aren't here to make up the numbers, as their coach Andy Moles had clearly said. Against India in their second warm-up game, their batsmen went after the 365-run target gamely and don't need to look beyond Ireland's performance against the West Indies for inspiration.Afghanistan would rely heavily on their bowlers to make quick inroads into the Bangladesh batting to limit them, and give themselves the best chance of going after their target.Probable XI: 1. Javed Ahmadi, 2. Usman Ghani, 3. Nawroz Mangal, 4. Asghar Stanikzai, 5. Samiullah Shenwari, 6. Mohammad Nabi (capt), 7. Afsar Zazai (wk), 8. Mirwais Ashraf, 9. Dawlat Zadran, 10. Hamid Hassan, 11. Shapoor Zadran.Watch out forWhile all the attention will be taken up by Shakib in the middle order, Mominul Haque has revelled in the No 3 position for his team and come up with some eye-catching performances. Although yet to score a century in ODI cricket, he averages 63 in Tests, pointing to a good future ahead for the stylish left-hander. Against a pace Afghanistan bowling attack he would have to play the anchor's role and guide Bangladesh to a position of strength with the bat.Usman Ghani is just 17 but looked unperturbed against the likes of Mohammad Shami and Umesh Yadav in the warm-up game against India on his way to 44. Although he started explosively, Ghani settled into playing second-fiddle to No 3 Nawroz Mangal, who took over the senior batsman's responsibility. Against Bangladesh, Ghani would come out all guns blazing as he is expected to at his age.Quotes"If they do [win] they'll be dancing in the streets of Kandahar and Kabul and Jalalabad and wherever else," said former Australian fast bowler Geoff Lawson, who coached the Afghanistan Under-19 team previously.StatsAfghanistan beat Bangladesh in the only time they squared off in an ODI during the Asia Cup in Dhaka last year.Teams:Afghanistan (From): Usman Ghani, Javed Ahmadi, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Mohammad Nabi(c), Samiullah Shenwari, Mirwais Ashraf, Afsar Zazai(w), Najibullah Zadran, Dawlat Zadran, Shapoor Zadran, Aftab Alam, Hamid Hassan, Gulbadin Naib, Nasir JamalBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Mominul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Sabbir Rahman, Rubel Hossain, Taskin Ahmed, Al-Amin Hossain, Arafat Sunny, Soumya Sarkar, Taijul IslamLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
