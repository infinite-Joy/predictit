We are set for the start of the final ODI.Pitch Report: 'There was some rain in the morning, but it is cool at the moment with some heavy clouds hanging around. There should be some moisture on the surface, the team winning the toss will certainly bowl first.'Teams:England (Playing XI): Michael Lumb, Moeen Ali, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad(c), James Tredwell, Stephen ParryWest Indies (Playing XI): Dwayne Smith, Kieran Powell, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo(c), Darren Sammy, Denesh Ramdin(w), Nikita Miller, Sunil Narine, Ravi RampaulWest Indies have won the toss and have opted to fieldHello, and a warm welcome to the deciding ODI between West Indies and England. In a scrappy encounter on Sunday, the visitors kept the series alive with a three wicket win. On a slow surface, West Indies were undone by the English spinners. Will they fare better today? Toss and team updates in a while..PreviewWith the series level at 1-1, West Indies and England will go hard at each other as they look to clinch the series in the third and final ODI at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua.England:West Indies won the first ODI by 15 runs despite a fine ton on debut by Michael Lumb as the England team wilted under pressure and let the hosts run away with the game. England's batting looked out of sorts in the second match as well, with the top order crumbling under pressure before Ravi Bopara and Stuart Broad put on an unbeaten eighth-wicket partnership of 58 to help the visitors chase down 160. Lumb has done well in both the matches with the bat while his opening partner Moeen Ali has looked good too, but has been unable to convert his starts. England will be hoping for a powerful start from the opening pair while they will also expect the likes of Luke Wright, Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, who have failed in both the games, to come good with the bat.England's bowling has been on the mark in both the matches although brutal hitting by Darren Sammy and Dwayne Bravo during the death overs got West Indies to a good total in the first game. In the second match, the spinners came to the fore - led by debutant Stephen Parry, the visitors managed to restrict the Caribbean team to a paltry 159. Apart from Parry, Moeen and James Tredwell did a good job with the ball, as did Root. Broad and Bresnan went for some runs in the first match but they came back well with an economical performance in the second game. England will be hoping for the bowlers to continue their good showing as they seek to clinch the three-match series.West Indies:Like England, the hosts have also not be up to the mark with the bat in this series so far. While Lendl Simmons has scored back-to-back half-centuries and Dwayne Bravo and Sammy lifted the team to a competitive total in the first match, West Indies have been let down by the top order. Dwayne Smith, Kieran Powell, Kirk Edwards and Darren Bravo, have all failed to deliver with the bat, which has hurt the home team in both the matches. West Indies will be hoping for them to bat with more application and occupy the crease for longer periods.West Indies have been good with the ball just like England, probably even better, as they made the visitors sweat while defending a low total in the second game. They were superb in the first game pulling things back well when England were in control of the game. They tried to do that in the second game as well and almost managed to pull off an incredible win but for the efforts of Bopara and Broad. Sunil Narine was good in both the matches while Nikita Miller, who was included for the second game, did a fine job with his left-arm spin. Dwayne Bravo and Ravi Rampaul conceded a few in the opening match but were better in the next game while Sammy has been keeping it tight. West Indies will be expecting the bowlers to deliver again.Quotes:There's been some pretty average batting over the course of the two games. We need to play better at the top of the order: West Indies coach, Ottis Gibson.To get over the line should give the changing-room a huge amount of confidence and belief. We've not won two games in a row since July.
