Swart will open the attackWelcome back.. New Zealand have never chased more than 139 to win in a T20 Cup chase. Will they break the record today?Borren: "It was not a bad effort. We have to bowl our hearts out and field well now. Looks like it's not going to be easy. They have a pretty good batting line up. We are 15 runs short of the par score. The wicket is holding up a bit. The key will be early wickets. We have to take pace off the ball like we did against South Africa. We will have to do something special here if we are to pull it off."Netherlands will be reasonably happy with their score on the board. Myburgh struggled at the top but Swart kept the scoreboard ticking with the occasional boundary. Skipper Borren promoted himself up the order and smashed the bowlers all over the park. He had a few lives but rode them and fell just one short of his fifty. Tom Cooper played aggressively at the fag end to propel the Dutch past 150. But for a couple of very good last two overs from Neesham and Boult respectively, they could have easly gone past 160. New Zealand will feel confident about the chasing down the target with their strong batting line-up but you never know how things could pan out in this game.

NETHERLANDS:5.1 Boult to Swart, no run, length delivery outside off stump, Swart defends off the back foot
NETHERLANDS:4.6 Corey Anderson to S Myburgh, SIX, that should be a great lesson for Anderson if he's willing to learn.

NETHERLANDS:3.6 Boult to S Myburgh, 1 run, full on the stumps, driven to mid-on for a sharp single

NETHERLANDS:3.4 Boult to S Myburgh, byes, FOUR, how did that miss the stumps? Almost shaved the leg pole. Again the front foot goes across the line and in trying to go leg-side to this incoming length ball, Myburgh gets into an awkward position to play the ball and misses, luckily it beats the stumps and the keeper
NETHERLANDS:3.3 Boult to S Myburgh, no run, very, very optimistic shout from Boult. Full and sliding down, Myburgh was cramped for room, he misses the ball and is struck on the boot. Aleem Dar quietly walks away from the sticks. That would have probably hit the 6th or 7th stump
NETHERLANDS:3.2 Boult to S Myburgh, 2 runs, driven hard but Neesham at cover fumbles to allows the batsman a couple of runs

NETHERLANDS:2.1 Mills to Swart, 1 run, full delivery on the stumps, pushed down to mid-on for a brisk single
NETHERLANDS:1.6 Boult to Swart, 1 run, 'yes one' was the call from Swart, a direct-hit at the striker's end could have been curtains for Myburgh. Swart pushed the short of length delivery to cover-point and set off immediately
NETHERLANDS:1.5 Boult to Swart, no run, much better from Boult. Angles the length ball away from the right-hander from over the wicket, Swart looks to run it down to third man but misses
NETHERLANDS:1.4 Boult to Swart, FOUR, so both openers get off the mark with a boundary. Short from Boult, not high enough to trouble Swart, he rocks and pulls it over mid-wicket to gets his first runs on the board
NETHERLANDS:1.3 Boult to Swart, no run, on a length and outside off stump, punched into the off-side
NETHERLANDS:1.2 Boult to Swart, no run, lazy stroke that from Swart. Fullish and just shaping away, Swart plays away from the body and gets lucky
NETHERLANDS:1.1 Boult to S Myburgh, 1 run, whipped very fine in the air but just short of the man at short fine leg. Looks like McClenaghan has hurt his thumb in trying to go for the catch. The ball escapes and they sneak through a singleTrent Boult, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
NETHERLANDS:0.6 Mills to S Myburgh, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Myburgh drives with an opened face of the bat to third man

NETHERLANDS:0.4 Mills to S Myburgh, no run, nice and full this time, Myburgh drives hard but picks out mid-off
NETHERLANDS:0.3 Mills to S Myburgh, FOUR, he showed in the last game what he can do when you offer him width outside off stump, but Mills hasn't learnt from it. Short and wide outside off stump, Myburgh stands tall and absolutely blasts it past cover-point and he opens his account in style
NETHERLANDS:0.2 Mills to S Myburgh, no run, fullish delivery outside off stump, Myburgh pushes it into the off-side
NETHERLANDS:0.1 Mills to S Myburgh, no run, well, low bounce straightaway. Good length delivery outside off stump, the ball hit one of those cracks and died down immediately, luckily it wasn't in line with the off pole as Myburgh was completely foxed by itS Myburgh and Swart are at the crease. S Myburgh is on strike. Mills will open the attackThe teams line up for the anthems. The openers make their way out to the middle. The Netherlands fans in the stands are pretty excited.Teams:Netherlands (Playing XI): Stephan Myburgh, Michael Swart, Wesley Barresi(w), Tom Cooper, Peter Borren(c), Ben Cooper, Logan van Beek, Mudassar Bukhari, Timm van der Gugten, Pieter Seelaar, Ahsan MalikNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Brendon McCullum(c), Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Trent Boult, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghanPeter Borren: "We are hoping for a good performance. We were in there for 70% of the game against South Africa. We are in good shape. It looks drier as the tournament wears on. We would have also liked to bowl on. We are going in with the same XI. We should have got over the line against a top side. We are backing the same boys."Brendon McCullum: "We are focussed. We are respectful of these guys but we have a squad that can be quite competitive. The wicket may hold up, looking at the strength of their bowling. They are suited to this pitch. There will not be intense dew but it will slide on later in the innings. Tim Southee misses out and so does Munro. Boult and Neesham come in."New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to fieldBarresi: "It has been quite a roller coaster, an adventure tour. We have been working hard. It was unfortunate to be bowled out for 39 in one game but to come back like that against South Africa was fantastic. We lack experience, we lack depth at times but we have stroke-players. We need to assess the conditions first and restrict them to around 150. That will be par here."Pitch report: "Lovely 22 yards. Beautiful overhead conditions. The boundaries square of the wicket are very short. The Dutch played Sri Lanka here, the Kiwis played South Africa here", says Danny Morrison. "It is a nice pitch. 160-170 will be a good score. You have to be careful with the shot selection. There are a few cracks, it could even crumble later. The team that wins the toss must bat first", reckons Russel ArnoldHello and welcome to Game 25 of the T20 Cup. Toss and team details coming at you in just a bit..The Dutch side, brimming with talent, will be eager to put up another eye-catching show, while simultaneously plotting to upset New Zeland's apple cart. With the pitches in Bangladesh aiding spin, will Ronnie Hira break into the XI?Netherlands were mauled by Sri Lanka but the Orange brigade gave South Africa a major scare on Thursday. Ahsan Malik and Tom Cooper lead the bowling and batting charts respectively. However, much will hinge upon Stephan Myburgh's pyrotechnics at the top of the order.Stung by Dale Steyn's scorching spell at the death, New Zealand will seek to bounce back as the T20 Cup hurtles towards its business end. Currently sandwiched between South Africa and England, the Kiwis will also have one eye on boosting the net run rate to escape the mid-table congestion. By all means, the English are back into the reckoning in the aftermath of the Hales storm.PreviewNetherlands have another chance to showcase their prowess when they take on New Zealand in a Group 1 league game in the World T20 in Chittagong on Saturday. The Kiwis meanwhile can involve themselves in a three-way race to the semi-finals with Sri Lanka and South Africa. If they do beat the Dutch with a significant margin, their net run rate would keep them well ahead of the Proteas, with one last game to go for the top three in the group.Netherlands: It has been a strange tournament for the Dutch so far. No one can accuse them of not looking the part with the big boys in international cricket. First they decimated Ireland to qualify for the Super 10s, then they were crushed by Sri Lanka before Netherlands exhibited their undoubted talent and limited experience in a narrow loss to South Africa. Netherlands are not blessed with stars but what they can do is count on some of their proven performers like Myburgh, Barresi, Borren and the Cooper brothers to pack a punch against quality opposition. Their challenge in the World T20 is as good as over but another sharp game like the one against South Africa, will hold the Netherlands in good stead in the time to come.Key Players: Malik Jamil, with his maiden fifer in international cricket and Myburgh with an explosive fifty against an attack led by Dale Steyn, let the world know that the Netherlands were no pushovers and they were in Bangladesh to compete. One gets the feeling, the Dutch would once again revolve their show around this pair.New Zealand: The Black Caps have not had a lot of success in ICC events, barring the ICC KnockOut in Kenya in 2000 but they have always shown some spark - just like they have in this tournament. After escaping with a lucky D/L win over England in their first game, New Zealand were stopped in their tracks by Dale Steyn as they were subjected to a two-run loss.However, the power packed batting line-up, boasting of Kane Williamson, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor and Brendon McCullum will throw a stiff challenge to the Dutch bowlers, who did show some discipline against the South Africans.It is important for New Zealand to come out all guns blazing against the minnows and ensure they collect the two points that would pit them level with Sri Lanka and South Africa and also bolster their net run rate further.Key Players: Taylor is always the key man for New Zealand in any tournament and he is by far their best batsman. Skipper McCullum is a dangerous player in this format and would love to explode against the Netherlands in an attempt to intimidate them. Kyle Mills will lead the bowling attack and you can expect him to cause a few concerns for the Dutchmen.Ground Reality: Formerly known as the Chittagong Divisional Stadium, the ground first hosted international cricket in 2006. Both New Zealand and the Netherlands have played two T20 Internationals in Chittagong but while the Black Caps have won one of them, the Dutch have lost both.Stats: - Brendon McCullum is 21 short of becoming the first man to get to 2000 runs in T20 Internationals Quotes: We had a good opportunity to beat South Africa and we've got two more opportunities left. The hope is that we can get one win against New Zealand or England and go home a little bit happier - Peter Borren, Netherlands captainTeams:Netherlands (From): Stephan Myburgh, Michael Swart, Wesley Barresi(w), Peter Borren(c), Tom Cooper, Ben Cooper, Mudassar Bukhari, Pieter Seelaar, Logan van Beek, Timm van der Gugten, Ahsan Malik, Eric Szwarczynski, Tom Heggelman, Vivian Kingma, Michael RipponNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Brendon McCullum(c), Ross Taylor, Colin Munro, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent Boult, James Neesham, Anton Devcich, Ronnie HiraLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
