ENGLAND:44.6 Nathan McCullum to Adil Rashid, out Caught by Boult!! Partners with the new ball, partners in catching as well. Tim Southee once again does it.

Southee runs to his left, catches the ball and just before he was about to go over the rope, he throws it to Boult, who was running in from long-off.

ENGLAND:43.6 Southee to Adil Rashid, no run, perfect start for New Zealand after this rain break. It was a full toss outside off, Rashid looks to drive but fails to make contact, the keeper collectsNew Zealand players break out of the huddle as Plunkett and Rashid walk out to the middle. Southee will bowl the final ball of this over. Remember folks, England need 34 runs from 13 balls. Here we go then...20:52 Local Time, 19:52 GMT, 01:22 IST: Restart will be at 21.10 local time. England's target will be 379 in 46 overs.20:48 Local Time, 19:48 GMT, 01:18 IST: The rain has stopped once again and the groundsmen are currently working to get play underway as soon as possible. The covers are coming off once again. Let's hope it stays like that20:42 Local Time, 19:42 GMT, 01:12 IST: I spoke too soon. The rain eased off for a little while, but now the umbrellas have gone up once again. The covers are being put in place once again.20:39 Local Time, 19:39 GMT, 01:09 IST: Good news folks! Looks like the rain has stopped. The covers are coming off.Mitchell Santner and Grant Elliott are bowling a few warm-up deliveries and these two could well be McCullum's choice to bowl those final two overs after Southee finishes his over. Only 1 bowler can bowl a maximum of 10 overs and 4 bowlers can bowl a maximum of 9 overs. Boult has already bowled his 10 overs. Southee too will finish his quote after this final delivery.This rain break has surely helped New Zealand. Earlier England needed 54 runs from 37 balls and after the rain break, they need 34 runs from 13 balls. It is not impossible, but surely it has become a little more difficult for England.20:20 Local Time, 19:20 GMT, 00:50 IST: Ohh dear! The rain has gotten heavier and the umpires have decided to take the players off the field. At this stage, England are 9 runs behind the par score of 355(D/L).

There are two slips in place for him.Elliott, Ronchi and Santner came out and played handy cameos to push the New Zealand score even further. The English bowlers though were very disappointing and now it is upto their batsmen to try and repeat their feat of the first ODI. It is not going to be easy as chasing is a different ball game altogether. The pitch though is great for batting. Join us in a short while to follow the run-chase.Taylor then joined Williamson at the crease and both of them kept chipping away with singles, while dispatching the loose balls away. Their 121-run partnership was the cornerstone of the Kiwi innings.

Here we go then...Weather Report: It is cloudy out there, with the sun playing hide and seek right now. There is some rain expected later in the day but hopefully, we can get a full game in. Fingers crossed!Teams:England (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, Liam Plunkett, Steven FinnNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent BoultMorgan: 'We would have batted first as well. It might swing throughout the day. There was a real buzz around the camp after that win. We have to drive things forward, we shouldn't focus on the results but how we play. We are a very talented side, we are in the process of changing our style of play. Hopefully, we can be consistent with it.'McCullum: 'We are going to bat first. It looks a good surface. You have to take it in your stride and sometimes the opposition deserves all the credit. More relieved that I have won two tosses in a row, doesn't happen that often. By batting first today, we are looking to put up a good score. They played really well in the last game. Sometimes, you just get beaten in the game. If you get your plans and preparations right, you will end up as winners more often than not. We have one change, Tim Southee comes in place of Matt Henry.'New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batTim Southee is expected to make a return to the playing eleven after he was rested for the first ODI. He will replace either Henry or McClenaghan, both of whom were very expensive. Toss and teams coming up in a short while from now. Stay tuned.It's a new day though and New Zealand will look to turn things around in this ODI. One thing is for sure that they will come hard at this English side. England, on the other hand, will look to carry the momentum forward to try and take a 2-0 lead in the series.McCullum came out all guns blazing, hitting two consecutive boundaries in the first over from Finn, before he got bowled off the very last ball of the over. There were handy contributions from Williamson and Taylor, but apart from that no other Kiwi batsman really got going. New Zealand lost their last 6 wickets for just 13 runs and were bowled out for 198.Both Buttler and Rashid were in a hostile mood, playing their shots without any inhibitions. They kept hitting the Kiwi bowlers all around the park, a move that saw them add 177 runs from just 105 balls, the highest 7th wicket partnership in ODIs. The attack was so fierce that the Black Caps could never recover from the onslaught.It was a breathtaking display of strokeplay from the lower-order after Root's brilliant century guided England through the first half of the innings. England were cruising at 171/2 at that point but they lost 4 wickets for 31 runs and were suddenly 202/6 after 30 overs. Instead of trying to bat out the remaining 20 overs, the English approach surprised one and all.In the first ODI, we saw a different England, an English side that is being called, 'New England'. How often would you see a team 6 down for 202 go on and make 408 in an ODI? Yes, that's what we witnessed in the last ODI, where a swashbuckling 177-run partnership between Buttler and Rashid saw England go past 400 for the first time in ODIs.June 09, 2015: 'New England' vs New Zealand - Root, Buttler and Rashid star in England's biggest win in terms of runs in ODIs. England 408/9, New Zealand 198/10. England thrash New Zealand by 210 runs.February 20, 2015: New Zealand vs England - Tim Southee's 7/33 demolishes England. England 123/10, New Zealand 125/2 in 12.2 overs. England suffer a humiliating defeat by 8 wickets.Preview:When England lost their first wicket on the first ball of the first ODI match on June 9, a lot of people nonchalantly shrugged their shoulders, knowing they could expect nothing less from the home side. Instead, what followed was a kind of systematic destruction that left the very same people blinking their eyes in disbelief. Not only did England register their first ever 400-plus total in ODIs, they also went on to achieve their biggest win in terms of margin of runs.In contrast, World Cup finalists New Zealand were disturbingly lacklustre. Brendon McCullum's choice to bowl first on a flat wicket invited undisguised criticism from the experts and the fact that the tourists could not capitalize on the opportunities they got, added to their troubles.England's innings in the first ODI could be divided into two parts - the first one, in which Joe Root and Eoin Morgan stabilized them with a 121-run stand after the initial hiccups, and the second one, which completely hinged on Jos Buttler's stunning 66-ball hundred and a record seventh-wicket 177-run stand that he shared with Adil Rashid. In between, New Zealand dominated the hosts for a brief period when they had them down at 202 for 6, a state they could not sustain for the remaining 20 overs. The Black Caps bowling attack relied heavily on Trent Boult and once he was used up before the batting powerplay, it gave England the freedom to dominate the rest of the party, which was well below par.Although New Zealand were bowled out for a paltry 198, their collapse cannot be entirely blamed on a shoddy batting performance. It had more to do with the gargantuan score that the hosts put up. Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor resisted to the best of their ability but the pressure of increasing required rate and a want for big shots, got them in the end. However, to give credit where it's due - Adil Rashid, who had starred with the bat earlier, went on to pick four wickets and helped stem the run-flow in the middle overs.One, however, cannot underestimate a team like New Zealand. Their widely discussed resurgence in the 2015 World Cup is a testimony to their fearless cricket, led by an astute captain like Brendon McCullum. The second ODI will be a test of their character, a measure of how they respond to the merciless thrashing they received three days ago. On the other hand, the challenge for the hosts will be to prove that their previous victory was not a fluke but indeed the beginning of a new era in English cricket.Match Date: 12th June 2015Venue: Kennington Oval, LondonStart time: 17:30 IST, 12:00 GMTWeather: Warm and humid with a high of 25 degree Celsius and a chance of thunderstorms later in the evening.Team News:England:Although England lost Jason Roy on the first ball of the match, they regrouped to post an intimidating 408/9. They complemented their strong batting with a decent bowling performance as well. The hosts would definitely like to stick to their winning combination and remain unchanged.Probable XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, Liam Plunkett, Steven FinnNew Zealand:With Tim Southee back, New Zealand would be expected to be a much stiffer opposition as their bowling attack gets reinforced. Don't forget he alone took seven wickets against England in the recently concluded World Cup. Mitchell McClenaghan is likely to sit out in his place. There is no word on Corey Anderson yet but if he is fit, Mitchell Santer, who had a forgettable debut, might find himself out of the playing eleven.Probable XI: Brendon McCullum (c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliot, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi (wk), Nathan McCullum, Matthew Henry, Tim Southee, Trent BoultTrivia:England have lost only one out of their last eight games at the Oval.The last time England and New Zealand met at the Oval was in 2008 and Grant Elliot's controversial run-out after colliding rugby style with Ryan Sidebottom, resulted in angry outbursts from the visiting team. However, New Zealand held their nerve and won the last-ball thriller.Quotes:"There's a balance between risk and reward. Previously scores between 200-250 made it pretty mundane, now you've got extremes which is exciting and brings in a whole different element to the game."- New Zealand coach Mike Hesson on England's 400-plus total in the first ODI."There might be a few downs along the way but in the long-term it will serve us really well. For us its about bridging a gap that has been there a while in one-day cricket."- England skipper Eoin Morgan on his team's positive approach since the previous game.Teams:New Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Mitchell McClenaghan, Ben Wheeler, Tom Latham, Corey AndersonEngland (From): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, Liam Plunkett, Steven Finn, Mark Wood, James Taylor, David WilleyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
