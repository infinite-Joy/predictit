ZIMBABWE:36.84- Ireland's win-percentage in World Cup- better than two Test playing countries- Bangladesh (34.48) & Zimbabwe (19.64)  36.84- Ireland's win-percentage in World Cup- better than two Test playing countries- Bangladesh (34.48) & Zimbabwe (19.64)@glennmcgrath11: A nail biter sees @Irelandcricket get up over @ZimCricketv & move them into the top 4 in Pool BThe Ireland bowlers were once again put to the sword. They have now conceded more than 280 in all their four matches. But, credit to Alex Cusack, who was incredible in the death overs. The experienced medium pacer varied it nicely and kept the batsmen guessing. In the end, he ended with a 4-wicket haul. And also bowled the crucial final over which sealed the game in Ireland's favor. The difference might have been the fielding between the two sides, Ireland were better and held on to whatever chances came their way. Williams heaved Kevin O'Brien towards deep mid-wicket, where Mooney claimed the catch. There was some confusion whether it was a clean take or not. But, Williams had already made his way out of the ground. The TV umpire took a long time and replays suggested that Mooney's left boot was in contact with the ad-cushions, but the decision could not be overturned as Williams had left the field. That changed the complexion of the game as Zimbabwe kept losing wickets. Mupariwa struck some meaty blows and brought the equation down to 7 off the last over. Cusack, however, kept his cool and picked up the remaining two wickets. Taylor looked in imperious touch. He used his feet beautifully to the spinners and was not afraid to take the aerial route. Some of the shots against Dockrell were simply outstanding. He managed to notch up his first ton since October 2011. And he looked set to finish the game off before a Cusack slower one had the better off him. Williams, though continued and kept the asking rate under check. However, a moment of drama saw the game change on it's head. Zimbabwe did not get off to the best of starts. Raza and Chibhabha struggled at the beginning, but somehow managed to add 32. However, they lost three quick wickets, including that of Hamilton Masakadza. Taylor and Mire kept going for a while before the latter threw it away. That wicket brought Williams to the crease. He combined well with the stand-in skipper to stitch a 149-run stand for the 5th wicket. Porterfield: 'Obviously, ebbed and flowed, especially in the last 10. It's never really over, but we managed to get across the line, so we are pretty happy. Obviously, it was a very good score, but we knew that it was a very good wicket. It was going to be hard to defend, especially with the square boundaries being very short and a pretty quick outfield. We had to be on the money and thankfully, we got over the line. No, he didn't. I am not sure how he (Cusack) got there 4 for 20 odd or 30. So, fantastic effort from him to come in and put in a performance like that was great. I think it's very hard to tell when you're on the line, it is a great catch anyways. It's a great skill under pressure to catch it, I haven't seen the replay, I don't know, a couple of people have been talking about ever since we came off. I thought it was a great catch whether he (Mooney) did or didn't, but I thought it was a great skill anyway. Just to catch it. I thought I might have to run in and dive there, but managed to make up the ground. Thankfully, held onto it. It is still in our hands and we talk about it, we will go each game to game. There is 2 points up for grabs and I don't know what actually happened in the other group game to be honest, I am guessing South Africa lost but it's in our hands, we can go to Hamilton now and look to get 2 points there and that's our goal. That's what we have got to look forward to.'Taylor: 'It's pretty frustrating to be in a winning situation again and just throwing it away a little bit. Ireland were a little bit more hungry and they deserved the win. I think so, we haven't been in that situation many times before, it hasn't been clever cricket from us at crucial periods, so that's hurting a lot. It's a tough one to swallow, but again credit to Ireland. Just poor really, that's the only word I can describe it, I don't think we were hungry in the field and I think our energy levels were low. These things I can't comprehend it is just really hurting me at the moment. I think we need to pull our socks up and try and finish with some pride. I hit it nicely but again getting out at the wrong time and a new batter coming in during the powerplay, those little things all add up. It was frustrating, but I would have liked to carry on. You got to take his word for it and then they zoomed in on it, but listen it looked pretty clear, but you take the fielder's word and the game moves forward (referring to Williams' dismissal). It's going to be a tough one at the Eden Park, but it's great to be in a World Cup, testing yourselves against the best players in the world. So, that's what it's all about.'Ed Joyce: 'We certainly did. We played the team with 3 spinners and 3 medium pacers. We know that we had to bowl really well and field really well to keep teams to a reasonable target. I thought it was a good toss to win for them, we would have bowled first as well and the chase was really hard to defend at the end and the boys did brilliantly in the end. He has got a, what's the word - cold heart, a 'cool head', that's the word I was looking for. He is a great guy to have a bowl in the last over. Obviously, they needed 7 with 2 wickets in hand. Two wickets left, you think the batting team have it in the bag, he's a top man and I was glad that he was the one bowling and I was glad that William Porterfield was the man, who was under the catch as well. I had a lot of luck early on before I got to 30 or 40, I probably needed that because they bowled well and there attack was suited to that wicket, and they bowled straight and back of a length, it was hard to get away. I took a few chances and obviously, got away with it. I ended up playing well towards the end, Andrew Balbirnie was fantastic as well, he has come into the team in the last 6 months to a year, and has been brilliant as a youngster.'Ed Joyce is the Man of the Match for his brilliant 103-ball 112The Irish are extremely happy with this win. What a game it turned out to be! Porterfield congratulates Taylor on his knock and both the sides shake hands as the Irish team walk off the field. It wa

ZIMBABWE:46.5 K O'Brien to Sean Williams, out Caught by J Mooney at deep mid wicket!! It was a fullish delivery on the stumps, Williams goes for the big heave and picks out Mooney at the deep mid-wicket boundary. However, that looked like a six as the ad skirting moved as Mooney moved his left leg after taking the catch. Well, the third umpire doesn't think so and he has deemed it out. It's just very confusing and he has been given out. Sean Williams c J Mooney b K O'Brien 96(83) [4s-7 6s-2]K O'Brien to Sean Williams, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Is that a six or is that out? Mooney doesn't think so. The third umpire is checking whether the fielder at the rope was touching the ad cushion or not. It looks like there was a little movement on the ad skirting. It is a difficult one for the umpire and it could well decide the fortune of both the teams. Apparently, Williams has left the field and the new batsman is out. Drama all over! The decision has been made and he has been given OUT! Ohh dear! Will it cost Zimbabwe the match?

ZIMBABWE:45.5 Cusack to Chakabva, leg byes, 3 runs, comedy of errors!

The next 5 overs will be crucial for both the teams. Who will come out on top? Answer coming up in a short while..Time for a drinks break. Zimbabwe have kept going at a decent rate since the fall of Mire. These two have batted exceedingly well to keep the scoreboard ticking. Taylor, in particular, has been superb with his lofted shots and played well all round the wicket. Ireland have to send back these two, if they have to win this game.
ZIMBABWE:34.6 Dockrell to Brendan Taylor, no run, floated up, Taylor shuffles across, kneels and tries to fetch it from way outside off, fails to connect, the ball goes through to Wilson.

They challenged the decision and the Snicko confirmed that there was no edge.Ireland are reviewing a caught behind appeal. They took a long time before making the call. Dockrell's front foot is fine. It seems to have come off the forearm. Nothing on the Snicko when the ball passes the bat or glove. There is nothing to overrule the onfield decision.

Cusack will open the attackWelcome back... Ireland have done extremely well to notch up 331. It will need a record run-chase from Zimbabwe to achieve the target. Can Taylor and Co. get their act together? We'll find out as the Zimbabwe openers make their way out to the middle. Cusack will open the attack..Zimbabwe's bowling lacked penetration. Panyangara and Chatara were disciplined at the start, but went for plenty at the end. Williams was expensive, however, he managed to scalp three wickets. The fielding was very poor and that is when you put it gently. They dropped as many as four catches. Most of them were straightforward chances. Nonetheless, they have to forget that quickly and come out with a positive mindset, if they have to overhaul the mammoth target. Join us in a short while for the run-chase.He recorded his third ODI ton and it was his first in World Cups. However, he got out soon after reaching the milestone. Balbirnie, who played second fiddle while batting with Joyce then took the mantle from him. The hard-hitting batsman was selective in his shot selection and kept going as the others around him took the necessary risks. He missed out on his maiden ODI ton as he fell 3 runs short. Apart from him, Kevin O'Brien and Gary Wilson played good little cameos to take the total past 300.It has been a superlative effort from Ireland, after they were sent in by Brendan Taylor. Though Stirling went early, Porterfield and Ed Joyce stitched a nice little partnership between them. The pair added 63 runs before the Irish skipper threw it away. Joyce continued and made the most of the reprieve he got while he was batting on 34. He brought up his first fifty in 62 balls, but accelerated once he got there and brought up his second in just 34 balls.4

Panyangara will open the attack. Here we go..Teams:Ireland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, Alex Cusack, Andy McBrine, George DockrellZimbabwe (Playing XI): Chamu Chibhabha, Sikandar Raza, Solomon Mire, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w/c), Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Regis Chakabva, Tawanda Mupariwa, Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai ChataraZimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldTaylor: "We are excited to get out and play today. Hopefully, we will get our second win underway. It should be a great contest and we are looking forward to that. Always a great opportunity and honor to captain your country. So, grab it with both hands. We are going to bowl. It maybe a little tacky underneath and with the overhead conditions, maybe we can use it to our advantage. It might grease up a little bit later under lights. Too many starts and finding ways to get out, that's been our main discussion in the last few days. Hopefully, one of the top four can bat big and get us over the line. I think 80% of those games during the matches we have been excellent and pretty poor in the other bits there. That cost us heavily. It's a new game and very excited to push for a good win."Porterfield: "Not quite home as its snowing back home. But, it is nice and fresh. The conditions overhead might suggest to have a bowl, but it is a very good pitch and we expect it to be like that throughout. I think it is more the back end and it has happened quite a lot in the tournament, but that's when you try and be at the top of your game and try to limit damage as much as anything. Few things have gone our way and we have to got to come up with a plan to minimise that. Every game is a must win game. If we get that win today, it makes it 3 in 4."So, who will win the toss? And who will bat first? Answers to these questions are coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.Pitch report: 'There should be good pace and bounce. There is even covering of grass, hardly any patches. The team batting second has had more success here. If you win the toss, one would like to put the opposition in,' reckons Russell ArnoldWeather Conditions: It is a cloudy day in Hobart with some rain expected in the later in the evening. The maximum temperature is expected to be around 21 degress Celsius, with the minimum being around 12 degrees.Team News: Ireland might be tempted to bring in Alex Cusack for Max Sorensen, who went for 76 runs in just 6 overs against South Africa. However, none of their players are injured and it won't come as a surprise if they field the same XI as the last game. On the other hand, Zimbabwe will miss Chigumbura and Taylor will captain in his absence. Regis Chakabva is expected to replace Chigu in the line-up.IrelandAfter consecutive wins against West Indies and UAE, Ireland were up against a strong South African side in the last game. The Irish bowled first and South Africa, riding on centuries from Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis, posted a mammoth total on the board. Rossouw and Miller also played crucial knocks at the fag end of the innings, helping South Africa post their successive 400+ score. With the bat, their run-chase never took off and they were struggling at 48/5 at one stage. Even though Balbirnie scored a fifty and Kevin O'Brien made 48, Ireland were bowled out for 210 at the end.This is a must-win game for Ireland as their last two games are going to be extremely tough. If they win today, they will have 3 wins out of 4 games and if they manage to beat either India or Pakistan, they will be sure of a quarter-final spot. However, with just 3 wins as well, they will have a chance as then the net run-rate will come into the picture. Therefore, the Irish will leave no stone unturned to try and force a winning result out of this game.ZimbabweZimbabwe have played 4 games so far in the tournament. Even though they only have 2 points on the table, they have given a tough fight to their opponents from time to time. In their last game, they started off brilliantly with the ball, reducing Pakistan to 58/3 at one stage. However, fifties from Misbah-ul-Haq and Wahab Riaz helped Pakistan post a fighting 235 on the board. Zimbabwe were 74/2 at one stage and at that time, it looked like the game would go down to the wire. However, they kept losing wickets in heaps and eventually folded for 215, losing the game by just 20 runs.Their only win came against UAE, a team that hasn't won any of their games. However, if they win their game today and the final game against India, they will also have an outside chance of qualifying for the next stage, but net run-rate will come into play. Their current net run-rate is not that bad, but they need to win today to put pressure on other teams. They will be without their regular captain Elton Chigumbura, who suffered a third grade quadriceps tear in the last game. In his absence, Brendan Taylor will captain the side.Let's take a look at the recent form of both Ireland and Zimbabwe:13:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: The race to the quarters is slowly gaining momentum and Ireland are still in the fray for the quarters spot. In fact, apart from the first 2 slots, the final two quarter-finals slots are still undecided and four teams - Pakistan, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe - are in with a chance of qualifying. For Ireland, it is imperative that they win today as their last 2 games are against India and Pakistan.Preview:Ireland have had a fruitful ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 campaign so far. Living up to their reputation of winning at least one big game, they did that against West Indies, and as expected, pulled off 21-run against UAE. However, their previous match against South Africa, where they suffered a 201-run loss, proved that lack of pace in their bowling attack remains a concern. Once South Africa scored above 400, and Ireland lost three wickets for some 20-odd runs, the outcome was a foregone conclusion despite their knack of chasing down big total. With the bottom-half of Pool B setting up nicely, the Irish are still in with a chance of qualifying to the knock-outs. They already have two wins and a game extra in hand, as compared to Zimbabwe, who they face at the Bellerive Oval in Hobart on Saturday.Zimbabwe haven't played Ireland in four years and with just one win in four matches, their chances of making the quarter finals are very slim. A win for them might not make a big difference, but since Ireland are due to face Pakistan and India, the equation might come down to their last league game. Captaining them this time around will be Brendan Taylor, since Elton Chigumbura suffered a third grade quadriceps tear on Sunday, and is set to be out for a bit. The last time these two teams faced each other in a World Cup - at Jamaica in 2007 - the match ended in a thrilling tie.Venue: Bellerive OvalDate and Time: March 7, Start time: 9 AMWeather: A maximum temperature of 24 with chances of shower later in the dayConditions: The venue will host its first game of the 2015 World Cup and expect to see plenty of runs with some carry and bounce.Team NewsIreland are carrying a fully fit side, which means that chances of making alterations are quite slim. However, they might be tempted to bring in Alex Cusack in place of Max Sorensen, who conceded 76 runs from six overs against South Africa. The option to replacing a medium-pacer with another medium-pacer will make more sense considering the bouncy nature of the wicket.The injury to Chigumbura means that there is a strong possibility of Regis Chakabva to come back in the Zimbabwe Playing XI. His scores so far in the tournament have been: 35 against West Indies and 2 against UAE.Players to watch out forHe has already produced a match-winning 92 against West Indies and Paul Stirling will fancy his chances against this opposition. The last time these two teams collided in an ICC event, it was during the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, where his 34-ball 60 took the match away. Failures against UAE and South Africa mean he will try and make amends on Saturday. His contribution at the top will stitch a nice platform for Kevin O'Brien to set up a late impetus and the fact that he recently rose to the 34th place in the ICC ODI batting rankings will do his confidence a world of good.Two identical scores of 76 against West Indies and UAE have made Sean Williams Zimbabwe's leading run-scorer this World Cup. In the absence of skipper Elton Chigumbura, his responsibilities increase. Against Pakistan too, just when he seemed to be getting in the groove, he was dismissed for 33. The signs though are ominous and he will take confidence from the fact that he scored a crucial 74 when he last played Ireland in 2010.Captains' takeBrendan Taylor: We feel we are 80 percent there. We think if we can close that gap a little bit more, I think we are heading in the right direction for a good win against Ireland. Against Pakistan, we needed a partnership but unfortunately 50 and 30-run partnerships won't get you over the line. It is extremely difficult to comprehend this loss. We were cruising nicely but again we found ways to get out at crucial periods - some soft dismissals as well. That's been a major downfall for us in the last four games, crucial periods when batters have needed to get through those initial periods, then finding ways to get out. It's not helping the team's cause.William Porterfield: You've got to put it [the loss against South Africa] behind you pretty quickly. The tournament's back-end fixtures come pretty quickly. Every game is a two-pointer for us and Hobart is no different. Two points are up for grabs and they are a pretty big two points for us. Whatever the outcome of Saturday's match, it will do well to match the excitement of Ireland and Zimbabwe's only previous World Cup encounter when the teams played out a thrilling tie at Sabina Park, Kingston, during the 2007 edition in the Caribbean.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Regis Chakabva, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(c/w), Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Solomon Mire, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Tawanda Mupariwa, Tinashe Panyangara, Tendai Chatara, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Chamu Chibhabha, Prosper UtseyaIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, George Dockrell, Max Sorensen, Andy McBrine, Peter Chase, Alex Cusack, Stuart Thompson, Craig YoungLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
