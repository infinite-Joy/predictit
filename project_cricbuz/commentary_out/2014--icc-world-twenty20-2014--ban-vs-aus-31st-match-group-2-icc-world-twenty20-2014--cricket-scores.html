Gazi will open the attackWelcome back. The dangerous Aussie openers, who have fallen short of the expectations, stride out. Spin might play a role, as Sanjay Manjrekar reckoned, before the start of the match.Shakib: "I thought I was batting well, I was hitting the ball very well. I should have scored consistently for my team. In T20s it's very short, obviously when you lose wickets you need to be smart enough but at the same time you've got to keep the scoreboard moving. It's an okay total. I wouldn't say it's a great total but if our spinners get some early wickets, it'll be hard for them. I would love to contribute with the ball as well."Join us for the run-chase in a short while.Bangladesh found themselves in familiar trouble at 2-12 as a result of some injudicious shot selection. Then, their senior pros assumed charge of the innings thanks to a 112-run stand that contained some lovely, clean strikes. Shakib was the chief aggressor while Mushfiq was not too far behind either. The Aussie bowlers though pegged them back at the death, despite spraying the ball all around the shop. Did they miss a specialist spinner? Well, you have to ask Bailey that.1

It has been a disappointing campaign. Nice to play the host nation today. We played some good cricket is the first 2 games. However, we have not put a complete game in any discipline. We have not said much after the India game. There is not much to be said after a performance like that. We have a couple of changes. Dan Christian comes in for Brad Hodge, Muirhead makes way for Nathan Coulter-Nile."Rahim: "So far it has been disappointing. We have couple of changes today. We have some plans in the batting as well. It looks a good track. We want to bat first and then the spinners will come on. Hopefully we click today. We have 3 changes. Gazi, Mominul come in. Taskin makes his debut for Bangladesh."Bangladesh have won the toss and have opted to batStarc: "To be honest we have been disappointing. It's all about coming out today, finishing the tournament with a win. Early on with the new ball, I try for some swing. Towards the death, I try to hit the blockhole or hit the bouncers. Doug used the short ball well against India. Look there is no hiding behind the point that we have been disappointing. We expected more in this tournament, we have let people down. We do not wan't to go away with 4 losses."Pitch report: "The pitch is very hard despite a lot of traffic on it. That is one of the reasons why we are getting quick turn rather than slow turn. If you take a closer look at this surface, you can see a lot of roughness. There is some abrasion at the top. The captain winning the toss must bat first and get those spinners in later in these afternoon games", reckons Sanjay ManjrekarThe final day of the league phase, and it is Australia taking on Bangladesh in the first match of the day. Both teams have not yet registered a win so far, and the loser of this match will have the ignominy of becoming the only team not to have notched up a single win in the Super 10s. Plenty of pride at stake for both teams. Australia came into the tournament as one of the hot favourites, while Bangladesh would want to reward the perseverence of their fans with a victory. Hello, and welcome to the 31st league match of the T20 Cup. Toss and team updates in a while.PreviewThe second but last game of what has been an interesting World T20 so far, has been reduced to a dead rubber, thanks to poor cricket by one of the best sides in the world another team, that flatters to deceive at times and at others, leaves their admirers frustrated with their seeming incompetence on the field.Australia will take on hosts Bangladesh in Dhaka in a game that will have no bearing on the tournament - but a solid performance by the Asians, could still light up the day for the hosts.Australia: This does not happen very often. Australia knocked out of a world event after having played two games, having lost both and having to eagerly wait and see if Bangladesh could beat Pakistan. As soon as all hopes of a semi-final qualification were dashed, the men from Down Under ran into a red-hot India, who had already booked their place in the last-four on the back of three wins.Australia, true to character, showed some fight early on, stalling India's heavy batting artillery but not for long. An out-of-form Yuvraj Singh destroyed George Bailey's plans in a ruthless assault towards the end of the innings and the spinners, led by R Ashwin, rocked their batting-line up on a slow pitch.Now with nothing, not even pride to play for, Australia must take on hosts Bangladesh, who too lost all their three games. A win against Bangladesh, after elimination from the World T20, will not even be noticed back home, but Australia can still try and get a few things right. The Tigers have lacked the fight to stand up against the likes of India, West Indies and Bangladesh and Australia need to show them who is boss.Darren Lehmann, the very popular coach, the architect of Australia's revival, in the course of their series wins over England and South Africa, had stormed out, as one batsman after another, kept committing basic errors against India's spinners, would like to see his wards polish their skills in these subcontinental conditions.Lehmann has been critical of players like Brad Haddin, Shane Watson and David Warner while Bailey admitted that the defeat against India was his most embarrassing ever. Can they spring a major assault on Bangladesh on April 1? Will a convincing victory do anything to cheer a clearly miffed Lehmann? Time will tell.Bangladesh: On the other hand, the hosts are in a better situation. Few apart from their loyal home fans would have expected Bangladesh to make it past the group stage. Even Shakib-al-Hasan showed the lack of ambition for his team when he said their target was to qualify for the Super 10s. So in this scenario, even a closely fought battle against Australia could endear Mushfiqur Rahim and his men to the thousands, who are bound to flock Mirpur on Tuesday. What happens thereafter is anybody's guess but Bangladesh will certainly be the more motivated side going into their last game of the tournament.Ground Realities: It will be the first T20 International between these two teams at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur and with neither having opened their account in the tournament, it could make for an interesting contest, at least for the home fans. If Bangladesh win and finish above Australia in the group stages, the cricket fanatics in Dhaka will find something to cheer about.Statistics: - David Warner is the fourth highest run scorer for Australia, with 1343 runs from 50 T20 Internationals but he has had a poor tournament, aggregating a mere 43 from three inningsQuotes: I'm disappointed for the team. I'm disappointed with the way we batted. But I'm not embarrassed for anyone, apart from myself. If I was embarrassed I'd say it is with my own performance - George Bailey, Australia captainTeams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Shamsur Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mahmudullah, Ziaur Rahman, Al-Amin Hossain, Sohag Gazi, Abdur Razzak, Farhad Reza, Sabbir Rahman, Mominul HaqueAustralia (From): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Cameron White, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, George Bailey(c), Brad Hodge, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Starc, Doug Bollinger, James Muirhead, Daniel Christian, James Faulkner, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Brad HoggLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
