INDIA:47.4 47.4 Lee to Yuvraj, FOUR!!, India have won and are through to the semis! End of the road for Australia. What a journey it has been as well. I don't think anyone can even come remotely close to surpassing or equaling their record in World Cups. The dream semis is on now - India vs Pakistan at Mohali. Their reign has been ended by India. Magnificent scenes as Yuvraj makes room and flays that over cover, he is pumped or what, waves the bat wildly and lets out a huge roar, sinks on his knees and pumps his fists in delight. Raina walks up to him and embraces him in a bear hug. What scenes at Motera! Ponting walks off - respect to the great man - it could be his last game in World Cups. As soon as the winning hit was hit by Yuvraj, the Indian team raised together and congratulated each other. PS: Even Munna who was having his dinner, got up and celebrated. Not sure whether he finished his dinner or not.

The trade-mark smile is there too on his face. Some things never change!Saurabh Somani has more to say: Stayed beside a pillar at far end of press box when Yuvi and Raina came together, heroically sacrificing work in favour of superstition

Ravi Shaz is on fire, ice and what else: The Australian supremacy in World Cups could end. It has been 11 years and x days it has lasted. It could all end in the next 11 minutes. Tom Moody responds wittily: Can I add the 11 seconds as well?
INDIA:46.1  Johnson to Raina, FOUR!!, Ravi Shaz has the Baba countdown on and he says it has begun, Raina gets inside the line and gently glances it off the hips, fine leg is too wide and an easy 4, only 11 needed now, lots of celebrities in the crowd are heaving a sigh of relief.Mitchell Johnson [7.0-0-31-0] is back into the attack

INDIA:39.1  Lee to Raina, FOUR!!, now Raina has been injected with a huge dose of self confidence after that last Yuvraj shot, rocks back and smashes the pull through mid wicket, Lee dragged it down and Raina timed it beautifully, they say he is not a good player of the short ones, but on these placid Indian pitches, he can be pretty effective
INDIA:38.6  Tait to Yuvraj, FOUR!!, Yuvraj has pasted that to the deep point fence, short and wide outside off, Yuvraj went deliberately up and over point, one bounce over the ropes, Tait can't believe how hard Yuvraj hit that, he walks back in despair, cracker jack of a shot from Yuvraj and the crowd find their voice again

The famous whip-lash square cut with Dhoni rising onto his toes to crack that short and wide delivery outside off, he went at it, but could not get it up and over the man. To the right of Pup and he latched on. That was flying, but Pup won't drop those. Now the game has shifted back in favor of the Aussies. They are all smiles now. The crowd's voices and a billion voices in India have been muted. Pressure game from now on. Dhoni c Clarke b Lee 7(8) [4s-1] Lee to Dhoni, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:37.2  Lee to Dhoni, no run, a wild hoick as the pressure has got to Dhoni, the ball reverses in and goes in between the bat and pad gap, poor shot from MS under the circumstances
INDIA:37.1  Lee to Dhoni, no run, that's the difference between a Mahendra Singh Dhoni and a Gambhir, MS knows where the ball is, but mind you, another brain explosion from both, Dhoni edged it onto his back pad, the ball nearly fell on the leg stump, Dhoni looked at Yuvraj and wanted the single, Lee rushed across in a flash and almost caused another run-out, Dhoni and Yuvraj in the end are safeBrett Lee [5.0-0-20-0] is back into the attackLee is rewarded for that magnificent piece of fielding by getting a call from his skip to bowl.
INDIA:36.6  Johnson to Yuvraj, no run, solid forward defence to end, back and across, before leaning forward to block
INDIA:36.5  Johnson to Yuvraj, 2 runs, again the front leg comes far too across, but since Yuvraj is in such fine nick, he can lay bat on that, Johnson knows that if Yuvraj misses he is in with a shout for LBW, instead a fabulous dive from Lee to his left saves a couple of runs for his side, magnificent stuff from Lee
INDIA:36.4  Johnson to Yuvraj, FOUR!!, Yuvraj has made up for that poor shot the previous ball with a magnificent on drive, the full face of the bat presented, high front elbow, high back-lift and as the ball met the bat, it made a sweet noise, mid on is too straight and had no chance, perhaps the shot of the day so far
INDIA:36.3  Johnson to Yuvraj, no run, fishing and missing, no foot-work from Yuvraj, not back and across, so does not get in line with the length ball outside off, throws his bat and hopes to connect, he connects thin air in the end

INDIA:33.2 David Hussey to Yuvraj, out Gambhir Run Out!! Major Brain melt down from Gambhir and he is gone. Yuvraj is absolutely seething out there. Unbelievable stuff from Gambhir, he could have been run-out 2 times and the third time he is gone. Third time lucky for the Aussies. The ball went wide of slip, White misfielded it, Gambhir was running down the wicket like a headless chicken as Sidhu would say. White picked it up and threw it back to David Hussey who did the rest. Aus are back in this and it's the sheer ridiculousness of Gambhir that has put India in this state. Gambhir run out (White/David Hussey) 50(64) [4s-2] David Hussey to Yuvraj, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!
INDIA:33.1  David Hussey to Yuvraj, no run, wrong end and both survive, mayhem between Yuvraj and Gambhir and the throw went to the wrong end, it was tapped to the left of the bowler, Gambhir wanted, then Yuvraj wanted, in the end both were safe as the throw came to Yuvraj's end, what a mess that would have been and Yuvraj isn't happy with GambhirDavid Hussey [3.0-0-10-1] is back into the attack

INDIA:32.4  Johnson to Yuvraj, no run, Punter has missed a run-out chance, a rare sight as rare as seeing the Super Moon, Ok, I exaggerated that a tad, it was flicked to him at short mid, he fumbled, that gave Gambhir the chance to spot a chance for the single, Punter threw, missed, Gambhir had given up, big moment in the game that

Once again this game takes a turn just when Kohli and Gambhir were doing it easily. Yuvraj comes in as the drinks trolley leaves the ground. He has been in superb nick right through-out. Can he carry India home today?
INDIA:28.3  David Hussey to Kohli, out Caught by Clarke at short mid wicket!! What a wicket that is for David Hussey and Australia. Against the run of play a wicket has fallen and this pulsating game takes another twist. Ian Chappell was saying that India were cruising and now they are not. Rank bad ball, a juicy full toss, so juicy that Kohli could have hit it anywhere he would've liked to. His cross batted hoick finds Pup who takes a smart catch. David Hussey and Punter can't believe their luck. Kohli walks back still thinking where that ball might have landed if he had connected properly.

They are not as cheerful as they where when SRT was there. But each and every run is being greeted with warm applause from the Motera crowd.This is what Saurabh Somani has to say: If you've ever wanted to watch a practical demonstration of the pendulum, watch a cricket match in Indian stadium in the moments before Tendulkar gets out. Massive din when he bats. Pin-drop silence when he departs.

Tait satisfied all those and he gets the biggest player in the opposition out. Short of length delivery outside off, Tendulkar tried to punch it on the up and edged it. Regulation take for Haddin. That bounced a tad and that caught the edge. Once again Tendulkar walked. Game on folks. No 49th ODI ton or 100th international ton today. Blame it on me, I jinxed it. Tendulkar c Haddin b Tait 53(68) [4s-7] Tait to Tendulkar, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Drama, heavy drama.  Tendulkar has edged one and is walking off. The umpires are checking whether it is a no-ball.

Good luck getting past it. We need to get him soon!Tait back on. He will get reverse for sure.
INDIA:15.6  Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run, Tendulkar's day so far and it continues to be, a much better fielder than Krejza would have made a great attempt to catch it at third man, Tendulkar tries the cute little upper cut, this one he gently guides it, Krejza running in from third man, misjudged it and the ball fell on the bounce to him, an athletic effort was needed, he gets up and signals that he might have lost it in the lights

A time for me (Srivathsa) to take a mini breather. India have done well so far on this slow and low wicket with Tendulkar guiding the chase expertly. Hate to put the commies' curse on him, but he looks in great nick and is in line to get his 49th ODI ton - which would give his 100th international ton. The players have finished their drinks and we are all set to go. Sachin is a run away from getting to yet another peak - 18000 ODI runs. Needless to say, Punter is second on the list and is miles behind him.

INDIA:12.4  Watson to Tendulkar, no run, impact outside off as Tendulkar prodded forward to defend, Watson and Punter appealed with all their force, Gould gave it not-out and the original decision would've stood even if Aus had taken their review, in fact Punter yelled at Watson and asked him, Watson said it was outside off, so Punter cooled down

INDIA:12.2  Watson to Tendulkar, 1 run, Tendulkar expected that bouncer, went deep back into his crease, rode the bounce and hooked it down to Tait at deep square, kept it along the ground which Sehwag failed to do. That's the difference between the all-time best and one of the best
INDIA:12.1  Watson to Tendulkar, no run, fuller length delivery on off stump, Tendulkar is creaming them beautifully now, driven hard back at Watson who bends down low and stops itComing back to the catch that was referred upstairs, Saurabh Somani, who is at the venue, says: The crowd thought Ponting had claimed the catch.

More VVS style and panache in that shot
INDIA:10.6  Watson to Gambhir, no run, Gambhir came down the track, in his trade-mark style whipped it, Punter standing at square leg, charged forward and dived full length, but could not scoop it up, on the bounce, just bounced. Superb effort, 200 marks for the effort. The crowd love it when Gambhir stays on the crease.Ponting has taken a diving full length catch, he is not sure, so he wants Gould to go upstairs. Tendulkar goes up to Erasmus and has word. It's an umpire review. Initially it looked like Ponting was signalling that it was not-out, then looked at Gould and wanted him to go for the third ump's call as he was not sure. It has bounced in front of a flying Punter. Gambhir will survive. This edge of the seat thriller continues to ding-dong.

INDIA:9.4  Johnson to Tendulkar, no run, Tendulkar was drawn into the drive, angled across him on a fuller length outside off, he wanted to drive, then left it alone, Tendulkar isn't happy with the ump for not signalling that a wide, it was close, not close enough

Surprise bouncer from Watson, bent his back and produced good disconcerting bounce off the deck. Sehwag was in no position to hook, in the end a lame top edge goes spiralling up in the air and Mr. Cricket settles under that easily. End of Sehwag who for some strange reason looked very nervy today - his body language was of a man who was consumed by self doubt.

Sight-screen issues. Sanjay Manjrekar says that this is not one of Tendulkar's favorite grounds - because he has had trouble with the sight-screen before as well. Ricky goes up to Tendulkar and asks what the issue is. There are lights above the sight-screen which is apparently causing Tendulkar some discomfort.

INDIA:3.3  Tait to Sehwag, wide, down leg
INDIA:3.2  Tait to Sehwag, no run, superb delivery, either you bowl a short delivery that should be below the head of Sehwag or a yorker, Sehwag gave it away too quickly, moved to leg and Tait fired it in, following him, Sehwag did well to yank his head out of the way and leave that
INDIA:3.2  Tait to Sehwag, no ball, the crowd roar, front-foot no-ball, free hit coming up, 51st no-nall of this WC, a short delivery and Sehwag ducked under that, the field can't change too.
INDIA:3.1  Tait to Sehwag, no run, fuller length delivery outside off, Sehwag stands tall and thumps it straight to the fielder at mid off, hit well, but can't find the gapThe adrenaline is racing here in the office. So I (Srivathsa) along with Realtime Thiru who is on scoring, once again are the trusted duo who are bringing it to you. Don't go too far. This could be one of the all time great WC games.
INDIA:2.6  Lee to Tendulkar, no run, pitched up and moving away outside off, Tendulkar sees that well and shoulders arms
INDIA:2.5  Lee to Sehwag, 1 run, a catching man is there for Sehwag, behind square leg, that's the ploy, target Sehwag on his ribs, Sehwag though gets inside the line and shuffles across a tad to play it softly and down into the turf, past Mr. Cricket at that position
INDIA:2.4  Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run, a bouncing short of length delivery outside off, is punched with the bottom hand taken out off the blade, Tendulkar softened the impact, it was in the air, but no gully and it races down to third man for a single
INDIA:2.3  Lee to Tendulkar, no run, fuller length delivery on off stump, Tendulkar gets forward and tries to cover drive, the bat face turns as he looked to play that, mistimed back to Lee
INDIA:2.2  Lee to Sehwag, 1 run, back of a length and on the middle and leg stump line, Sehwag whips it past a diving square leg man
INDIA:2.1  Lee to Tendulkar, 1 run, Sehwag has just passed a fitness test in the morning to play in this game, Tendulkar does not mind it one bit and pushes it wide of Punter at short cover, a well judged single and Sehwag had to scurry, which he did
INDIA:1.6  Tait to Tendulkar, 1 run, it would have been a wide had Tendulkar left it alone, short and wide outside off, Tendulkar chased it, reached out and the bottom edged cut went down to third man, brings Tendulkar the strike it will be Lee who he will be facing
INDIA:1.5  Tait to Tendulkar, no run, Tait gives Tendulkar the stare after the short delivery whizzes past Tendulkar's head, who swayed out of the line and left everything in the way, dropped his gloves and left it alone
INDIA:1.4  Tait to Tendulkar, no run, solid forward defence from Tendulkar, head over the ball and meeting it with a high front elbow, it was on a fuller length and was heading to off stump
INDIA:1.4  Tait to Tendulkar, wide, way outside off and that is an erratic delivery from Tait
INDIA:1.3  Tait to Tendulkar, no run, cut and a miss, surely the pulse of Tendulkar is racing
INDIA:1.2  Tait to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, Tendulkar is looking to take on Tait and be positive out here, might be the adrenaline is racing, short, wide and outside off, Tendulkar looks to repeat the Centurion 03 shot against Akhtar, this time the extra bounce of Tait takes the top edge and flies over the slip cordon, one bounce over the ropes, beats third man easily, Tait has his hands on his head
INDIA:1.2  Tait to Tendulkar, wide, down leg
INDIA:1.1  Tait to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, Ponting is encouraging Tait even as Tendulkar gets off the mark with a deftly angled steer past backward point, short of length delivery outside off, Tendulkar stood beside the line of the ball and played it with an open face, third man is too fine and he can't cut it off, Punter with all the confidence of the ton behind him, eggs Tait onShaun Tait, right-arm fast, comes into the attack
INDIA:0.6  Lee to Sehwag, no run, a pearler of a delivery, Sehwag was shaping to play the on-the-up punchy drive, the ball landed on off and moved away a fraction off the seam, it missed the edge, although to the naked eye, there was some sort of deflection as the ball went past the bat, since there is not much the third ump can do, without snicko or hot-spot, Sehwag will stay, Kettleborough - the third ump confirms the same and the original decision stays. The crowd breathe a huge sigh of relief.Drama here. Aus and Lee have gone for a review. Original decision is not-out. Mike Hussey thinks and says that he did not hear anything. It has gone upstairs. Remember that there is no snicko or hot-spot, so the third ump has to go by whatever he can hear on the stump mic camera. Still looking at various angles. Not-out is the call. Australia have lost a review. Sehwag survives.
INDIA:0.5  Lee to Sehwag, no run, short and wide outside off, pacy delivery too, Sehwag went for the flashing upper cut and missed, too quick for Sehwag and too quick to catch the edge
INDIA:0.4  Lee to Sehwag, no run, Lee goes wide of the crease and angles one in, Sehwag pushes it from the crease to mid on
INDIA:0.3  Lee to Sehwag, FOUR!!, Watson's expression says it all, lovely cover drive, on the up, stand and deliver stuff, like Dilshan does, fast hands, just leant forward and knifed it on the up, Sehwag is away and so are India, Watson shakes his head and cannot believe that it has gone to the fence
INDIA:0.3  Lee to Sehwag, wide, looked to have clipped the thigh, Lee and Australia went up for a caught behind appeal, but Erasmus gave it as a wide, looked to have clipped the thigh guard
INDIA:0.2  Lee to Sehwag, no run, the leading edge, but it dribbles back to Lee, Sehwag tried to close the face of the bat too early, but since he played it softly, it didn't carry back to Lee, who threatens to to throw it back at Sehwag, but doesn't
INDIA:0.1  Lee to Sehwag, no run, not 6 in a row, perfect delivery from Lee, pacy back of a length delivery on off and middle, Sehwag stands tall and punches it down to mid onSehwag and Tendulkar are at the crease. Sehwag is on strike. Lee will open the attackWe are all set for the Indian chase. It will be a pressure chase, let me tell you, whenever India have chased against Australia in ODIs (barring the odd occasion), it is the latter who has won most times in ODIs. This being a knock-out game, will bring it's own added weight of pressure on the Indian batsmens' shoulders. If they are to prove that they are indeed the best batting side in this World Cup, then they must fancy chasing this target down.Shafiul Islam, James Anderson, Boyd Rankin, Mudassar Bukhari and Dale Steyn. You know what I'm talking about right. Will it be 6 in a row? We'll know soon as he is on strike against Lee. A couple of slips for Lee as well.Lee v Tendulkar. Mitch v Sehwag. Let the battle resume. There is a small matter of the express pace of Tait to contend for the Indians as well. Johnson has already started the mind-games before the game by telling the media that he is going to target the rib-cage of Sehwag. Will that ploy work out? Lee v Tendulkar has been always an enthralling battle. Both true champions and so likeable gentlemen too. Will Tendulkar get his 100th international ton? Lots of things in store. The whole of India will be glued in in front of their television sets.Zaheer: The old ball and the slower one is working well for me. One of those things going your way. The surface was breaking up a bit, the umpires were careful about it. It was a dry wicket and could have broken up early. I was planning to bowl around the wicket anyway. It is a par score. We have to bat well and keep our nerves, one side of the wicket is turning. We have to bat sensibly and build partnerships to chase it down.Wonderful work in the field by Raina too, it must be said for he kept on diving and cutting off the sharp singles. He must have saved at least 20 runs. So already he is +20 without even batting. This game has followed the pattern that the India v Australia game in the 1996 World Cup, when Mark Waugh made a ton. The end result: Australia won a close game. Will today be the same? We'll find out when we come back for the Indian chase.A couple of things about Dhoni and Ponting: Dhoni's captaincy which has come under severe criticism in recent times, did a superb job - always attacking, keeping a short leg and a slip for the spinners and constantly rotating his bowlers. In fact during one phase of play, at a stretch of 4-5 overs, he gave his bowlers one over spells. The bowlers complemented him well, by not giving away easy runs. Ponting on the other hand, looked focussed, determined and never smiled even once through-out his innings. That shows how much he was in the zone today.The finish: Ponting was joined by David Hussey and they played sensibly, with the latter being the aggressor. Runs came at a fair pace, but credit must be also given to the Indians for bowling well, with Zaheer being once again outstanding. Ponting got to a ton, his 2nd consecutive one against India in a World Cup game and his first after 18 ODI innings. The crowd did not boo him and gave him a warm applause as he walked back after getting out. Australia ended up at 260, which is a highly competitive score on this low and slow wicket. It will get even slower and India have to bat out of their skins if they have to win this - especially since it is a pressure game and all the pressure will be on only one side. Ponting at his best: Once he got past 20, the Ponting of old who used to torment the Indians came back and he played a sublime innings. The glorious lofted inside out hit over cover to the spinners was a prominent shot throughout his innings and he played the spinners with complete ease - playing late, with soft hands and nurdling, nudging it into the gaps. And to consider all this after he was designated as someone who can't play the spinners when he flopped miserably way back here in 1998.Ding-Dong battle: It's been like a chess game. Not like a cricket match. Both sides not giving an inch to each other from ball one. The Aussies came out with a set plan in not giving away wickets early on to the spinners even as India went and opened the attack with Ashwin. Watson belted a few, before he perished to Ash. That's when the man for the big occasion came in - Ponting - under severe stress, with all sorts of rumors circulating about his impending retirement. The crowd at Motera would've done well to keep quiet when Ponting came in, instead they booed him loudly and that would've only stirred up the fighter in him even more. He took his time early on, and then showed his true class.4

Dhoni is moving his fielders, he has been pretty active today, while some things have worked for him pretty well, some haven't.

AUSTRALIA:38.1  Yuvraj to White, no run, White leans forward, the ball goes off the thickish outer half of the bat wide of the man at silly pointZaheer is getting some treatment near the boundary ropes from the team physio.

The terrific guy that he is, he has not pointed that out once to me. Anyway here is the man.That's drinks. Australia have played superbly so far, taking calculated risks and not gifting their wickets away with rash stroke-play. It seems that they have come into this game with a sound strategy and a fixed target in mind. They know that the pitch is spinning, turning and bouncing and have negotiated the spinners well so far.

AUSTRALIA:9.6  Ashwin to Watson, out Bowled!! The humongous hitter is gone. Sometimes your strength can be your biggest weakness.

Watson is on strike. Ashwin will open the attackAlright, grab some lunch and lock yourselves in front of your televisions. It's a spinner who will be starting off proceedings. Ashwin will be the man who will bowl the first over. He walks up to Yuvraj and has a word with him. It will be me (Srivathsa) who will be taking you through till the first drinks break. Get, set and go!The Indian team are in a huddle, MS is saying a few words to his mates. Tom Moody on air says that Australia always play the big games well, they will be up for it. He says they have 'smelt it, felt it and done it before.' He also reckons that the Indian side have a lot of self belief and the inclusion of Sehwag is a massive boost for them. The Aussie openers walk out. Watto and Haddin have a word with each other.National Anthems time: A magnificent atmosphere at the Motera as the players walk out with little kids in tow. First up is the Australian one - 'Advance Australia fair' and then the Indian one. As it ends, a huge roar goes up around the ground and the players walk off to get ready.Ponting talk: Lots of speculation regarding Ponting, apparently Cricket Australia have told him to be mentally prepared and get ready for an official press conference - where he will announce his retirement or else he will get the sack. Ponting, though has rubbished the claims and says he is still eyeing the 2013 Ashes. Whatever the rumors circulating around him, he has refuted those claims and says he is up for it. We will see today - he is a big match player and don't be surprised if he turns it on - as he so famously did against India in the 2003 World Cup final.Monstrous game of the World Cup coming up. It can't get bigger than this. India v Australia - World Cup quarter-final. Win - you meet Pakistan in the semis, lose and you go home. I've never been so excited before a cricket game - maybe the India v Australia World Cup final in 2003, but that was way back.Teams:India (Playing XI): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf PatelAustralia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, Michael Hussey, David Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Jason Krejza, Brett Lee, Shaun TaitBig change: Put the rumours aside, Sehwag is playing today.MS Dhoni: It looks like a good track to bat on, would have liked to bat first. Unless you don't think about pressure, it won't get to you. We should not take it as a pressure game, we need to think it as another opportunity to prove ourselves. Quite ready for the game. Yusuf Pathan is out and Sehwag is back in.Australia have won the toss and elected to batRicky Ponting: We are going to have a bat, the wicket may slow up as the game progresses. It is an exciting game for both teams, we have been looking forward to this from a long time, exciting to see what the day holds. Looking at the history here, 250+ will be a reasonable score. Batting was poor in the game against Pakistan, David Hussey is back in place of Steven Smith.Ravi Shastri tests his voice box for the umpteenth time, the two captains are out for the toss.Pitch report: The wicket is pretty dry, there will be some turn in offer for the spinners. There is an even grass cover, the wicket will probably be on the slower side. There are bare patches at one end which will bring the spinners into play. Seamers won't have much bounce and carry and it is a good batting wicket. The team that wins the toss should look to bat first feels Sourav Ganguly.The Numbers' game: In World Cups, India and Australia have played each other nine times. Australia has won 7 and India have won 2. However, in the knock out stages of ICC events, they have met 4 times where India have won thrice and the Aussies, once. At Motera, they have played twice, both have won 1 game each.Weather update: Max temp: 37 deg. It is hot and dry, no chance of rain.India's weakness is their bowling, the Aussie middle order is not in great touch, and this is the time for both teams to step up and make it count. There is no margin for error, a loss and you are out of the tournament and it can be said without the slightest of doubts that a thriller ride awaits. The weather and the pitch will attract more attention than any cricketer (apart from Sachin Tendulkar though), weather update coming your way.Yuvraj Singh: The first shot which I played against West Indies, the pull off the backfoot, gave me a lot of confidence. When I can play shots like those early in the innings, I know that I'm in there to score more. When I wasn't scoring runs, my parents supported me. Sachin played a very important role in motivating me, he kept advising me like an elder brother. We have played Australia many times before, and we know that they will pepper us with short balls, we are up and ready for it.There are only two people who have done this before for India - Mohammad Azharuddin and Sourav Ganguly. I'm talking about leading India in a 100 ODI games. Here's another one to the list. It is MS Dhoni's hundredth match as a captain. He has won 56 games, lost 35, tied 1 with 7 games producing no results.It is bigger than a Federer - Nadal clash at Wimbledon, it will be more exciting than a Manchester United - Chelsea game at Old Trafford, and it surely would involve more nerves than any game in this World Cup so far; it is Dhoni's India taking on Ricky Ponting's Australia in the all important quarter final at Ahmedabad. There is one thing that Sachin Tendulkar doesn't have in his kitty, a World Cup win; Ricky Ponting can be the only captain to lead his team to 3 World Cup wins; but only one person can get there. Will it be Sachin Tendulkar or Ricky Ponting who will have the last laugh by the end of the day?All said and done folks, this will be an epic game and it will be me - Ajith - bringing you all the action along with Sid V and Srivathsa. Stay locked in to your computers, we'll be back with more and more updates..by Saurabh SomaniThe quarter-final stage was supposed to be when the real cricket began in the 2011 World Cup, but of four matches, three have teams that are clear favourites. Pakistan have already demolished West Indies, and South Africa look much stronger than New Zealand, while Sri Lanka seem too formidable a proposition while playing at home against England. The only match that has a more-or-less even feel to it is - for better or worse - India versus Australia. The overwhelming crowd favourites against the defending champions. The best batting line-up assembled versus the bowling attack with the most strike power. And then there's the small matter of history. As everybody who subscribes to a newspaper, has a television or logs on to the internet knows by now, March 23rd 2003 was the last time India and Australia met in a World Cup match and that was the final. Almost eight years to the day, India has a chance to avenge that loss.India: The captain has categorically stated that the fielding cannot be improved. The bowling was seen as the weak link, but has been expected to improve. India's bowlers made short work of the West Indies after a poor start, but whether that was because of a poor opposition or better bowling will be better answered when they are up against Australia. The batting was expected to carry the side through, piling on enough runs to cover for inadequate fielding and erratic bowling, but the batting itself has been none too reliable with 29/9 being the figures etched in permanent marker. Perhaps India can try taking the batting power-play earlier than the 30th over, and more importantly not aim for the stars when they take it. It is better to score 30 runs in those five overs without losing a wicket than aim to score 50 and lose 4. It also pays to use the batting power-play strategically, since it will involve the captain throwing the ball to his best bowler (most likely Brett Lee for Australia) and India can use up Lee's overs at a time when Ponting would not necessarily want to bowl Lee.
The fitness of Virender Sehwag is India's major selection headache. If he does not recover from his knee inflammation in time, India is likely to go in with the same side that beat West Indies. If he does recover, the man to be axed looks likely to be Yusuf Pathan. It would be a harsh call on Yusuf, since it is expected that he will fail a few times, but deliver big when he does click. Raina is likely to be included in the eleven, and given his well-documented weakness against the short ball and Australia's abundance of men who can use it, taking Raina over Yusuf might not be the best move.Australia: Australia's remarkable unbeaten streak was ended by Pakistan, and in a curious way it might have done them some good. They no longer have to worry about keeping the streak alive, and even if it was weighing them down only subconsciously, that worry no longer exists. Their batting frailty was exposed by Pakistan's well oiled bowling attack, and though the Indian attack is hardly as menacing, the fact that the pitch is likely to be a turner means Australia's batsmen will be severely tested once again. Michael Hussey was to be a bulwark against the middle-order frailties but he has come in from the cold and everyone needs a little time to adjust to new conditions - time which unfortunately for Hussey, is not there now that the knock-outs are here. Australia's openers consequently carry a huge load and it is almost imperative that they give a good start. The bowling will need to be on target like never before, since if Tait or Johnson err too much they are likely to leak runs by the floods against the Indian batting. Australia comfortably outscore India in the fielding stakes, but the two sides comparative spin-bowling options even things out. Jason Krejza has improved considerably from when he first toured India, but he'll be bowling to the best players of spin in the world, and when Shane Warne himself came up short, Krejza will need something special to succeed.
Australia are likely to stick to the same eleven that lost to Pakistan, with the only debate being whether Cameron White will retain his place or not. If he doesn't, David Hussey will be the man to replace him, and that wouldn't be too bad a swap. Australia have looked like the world beating teams of the past when their pacers are on fire, but the key difference is that the current lot of pacers fire a lot less often than their predecessors. The link to the great era of bowling is Brett Lee - and he is clearly the leader and the heart and soul of the attack. Australia will need another command performance from him to rattle India's top-order.Key Numbers:Everyone will be firmly focused on the Number 99 for this match, but for the Australian team, there is a series of numbers that is even more worrying. They are: 10, 28, 12, 36, 7 and 19. They don't form some obscure math puzzle - those are the score of Ricky Ponting in the 2011 World Cup. He has been the fulcrum of Australia's batting and they look a different side when he is on song. However, the opposite also holds true and Australia's batting woes are mirrored in his struggle for runs.Battles within Battles:Ricky Ponting vs Harbhajan Singh: They both make no secret of the fact that they will never be on Christmas Card Exchanging Lists. Ponting's lack of runs in India was in many ways a direct result of his being unable to handle Harbhajan - especially in Tests. Both have seen better days as cricketers. Both are fighters who don't back down an inch. Both have - at some point in their careers - mastered their respective crafts. Is it any wonder that their face-offs have been as compelling as they have?Virender Sehwag vs Aussie pacers: Sehwag averages over 35 in ODIs and has a strike rate of 104. Against Australia, his average is below 23, while the strike rate falls to 90. Clearly, the Aussies have had the better of the Delhi dasher. The beautiful thing about Sehwag's batting, however, is that the past seldom matters. Heck, the previous ball seldom matters to the man. If he plays, his first agenda will be to get India off to a flying start. If he makes his second agenda that of correcting his career figures against Australia, then the Ahmedabad crowd might not even mind if they don't get to witness his opening partner score a hundred.Clarke and Hussey vs Indian spinners: Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey may well hold the key to a good Australian batting performance. They are among the side's better players of spin, and if the middle overs can be controlled by them against Harbhajan, Ashwin and co, it will go a long way towards taking Australia to safety. conversely, if they fall early, the rest of the batting will be much more prone to caving in to the spinners' wiles.Captain Speak:"People have been talking about short-pitched stuff a lot. It's not new to us. It always follows us. Wherever we are, the shadow of short-pitched deliveries can be seen. So I don't think it's a new strategy. Definitely they have got good fast bowlers. But not to forget, we have won a test match at Perth and the last time we won at Durban." - MS Dhoni is not too bothered about the short pitched stuff.
"It looks like every few weeks now I'm having to answer that question [On whether his retirement was imminent]. I'm enjoying it as much as ever." - Ricky Ponting lays his retirement reports to rest - for now.Teams:India (From): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni(w/c), Yusuf Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Piyush Chawla, Ashish Nehra, Suresh Raina, S SreesanthAustralia (From): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, Michael Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Jason Krejza, Brett Lee, Shaun Tait, Callum Ferguson, David Hussey, John Hastings, Tim PaineLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
