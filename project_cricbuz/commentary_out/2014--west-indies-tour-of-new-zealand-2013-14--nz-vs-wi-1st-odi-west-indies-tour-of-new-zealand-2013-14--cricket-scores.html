WEST INDIES:1.5  McClenaghan to K Powell, out Bowled!! McClenaghan has got it right. This was a good length ball that pitches on off and comes back, Powell makes a poor judgement as he shoulders arms to that and has his middle-stump knocked back. Just the kind of start that New Zealand required. K Powell b McClenaghan 4(5) [4s-1] McClenaghan to K Powell, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Mills will open the attackThe players are all out in the middle. Mills to start proceedings. Here we go....Welcome back for the run-chase. The Kiwi bowlers have to bowl out of their skin to defend this target. The new ball will be the key, if the West Indies batsmen survive that period then it should be easy for them to reach the score.The pitch has something in it for the fast bowlers. There is that extra bounce which troubled the batsmen, so it will be interesting to see how the West Indies batters go about in the run chase. Join us back in a short while for their innings.....West Indies have at last turned up on the tour. They got off to a brilliant start after electing to bowl. Ryder and Guptill didn't get going on their comebacks as they were snapped up by Rampaul. The in-form Taylor was done in with some amazing bit of work from Holder. Brendon McCullum was the only batsmen who looked comfortable at the crease as he got his fifty and went past 5000 ODI runs, before being given out LBW. His elder brother Nathan hit some lusty blows to get them past 150 and was involved in a good partnership of 44 runs with McClenaghan. The West Indies bowlers were led by Rampaul who got things going with two wickets at the start and was well supported by Holder and Bravo.4

Here we go with the first ball.....Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Kieran Powell, Johnson Charles(w), Darren Bravo, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo(c), Narsingh Deonarine, Darren Sammy, Denesh Ramdin, Sunil Narine, Jason Holder, Ravi RampaulNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), James Neesham, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Mitchell McClenaghanWest Indies have won the toss and have opted to fieldWith so many players returning returning it will be interesting to see the team compositions of both the teams. Toss and teams coming up in a short while.....Hello and welcome to the Boxing Day ODI at Auckland. Both teams have some short form specialists coming in. The visitors will be led by a Dwayne Bravo who they will look up to turn things around after a poor Test series. There is also Simmons, Charles and Ramapaul coming in. But, they will feel the absence of Gayle and Pollard who are out injured. The hosts have the hard-hitting left-hander Jesse Ryder returning to International cricket after two years. Even the availability of Martin Guptill makes them a stronger team on paper.Preview by Gokul GopalAfter a dismal showing in the Test series, West Indies will be hoping for a fresh lease of life when they face New Zealand in the first of the five-match ODI series at Eden Park in Auckland. The visitors, who lost the three Test series 0-2, will be looking for improvements while the hosts will be eager to extend their winning run and continue their domination.New Zealand: Ross Taylor superb batting performance was the highlight for New Zealand as they faced little problems in clinching the Test series. Now that the stage shifts to the 50-over format, New Zealand have adequate resources in their batting department to put the Caribbean bowlers under pressure. While Taylor and Brendon McCullum are the key batsmen in the Black-Caps line-up, the return of Jesse Ryder and Martin Guptill at the top of the order gives the home team an added strength. Kane Williamson, Corey Anderson and Jimmy Neesham are capable match-winners as well while the experienced Luke Ronchi completes a power-packed batting order. New Zealand also have batting options in Adam Milne and Colin Munro, although it is unlikely that they will get a game.As far as New Zealand's bowling is concerned, Kyle Mills and Mitchell McClenaghan are the frontline seamers while all-rounders like Anderson and Jimmy Neesham can also do a good job with the ball. Nathan McCullum's handy off-spin lends variety to the New Zealand bowling unit. All skipper Brendon McCullum will be hoping for is that the bowlers find the right line and lengths and keep pegging away at the West Indian batsmen.West Indies: Apart from their lack-lustre showing in the Tests, the absence of three key players will hurt West Indies. Skipper Dwayne Bravo will have to lead from the front while the likes of Kieran Powell, Johnson Charles and Darren Bravo will also need to step up and perform. West Indies also have Lendl Simmons and Chadwick Walton, who are immensely talented batsmen. However, all the batters need to contribute as a unit, show the necessary application in building partnerships and not fall apart like they did in the Tests.Tino Best and Ravi Rampaul are the main pacers in the Windies line-up while the visitors can also go to Dwayne Bravo and Darren Sammy to deliver with the ball. Jason Holder is another option that the West Indian management will be looking at. In the spin department, West Indies have Sunil Narine as the leader of the attack while left-arm spinner Nikita Miller and part-timer Narsingh Deonarine are the other options.Team News: Ryder's return to the New Zealand side after a gap of nearly two years, will be a big boost to the New Zealand team, as would be the availability of Guptill. With the series against India coming soon, both Ryder and Guptill will be looking to make their presence felt. For the West Indies side, seven ODI specialists have been added to the squad, but injuries to key players will be a blow for them ahead of the ODI series. Marlon Samuels had to fly back home after suffering a wrist injury to join Chris Gayle and Kieron Polland as the absentees. Their absence gives some of the lesser experienced players an opportunity said coach Ottis Gibson, who will be hoping that they make it count.Numbers:34: The number of runs Brendon McCullum requires to become the third New Zealand batsman after Stephen Fleming and Nathan Astle with 5000 or more ODI runs.15: The number of runs Kyle Mills requires to become the fourth New Zealand cricketer after Richard Hadlee, Chris Harris and Chris Cairns with 1000 or more runs and 100+ wickets.Quotes:We'll start on the same level come Boxing Day. We know the West Indies have different players and so do we: Brendon McCullum.We're more comfortable in the shorter forms. It was a disappointing Test series but hopefully the guys have put that behind them: Dwayne Bravo.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Jesse Ryder, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Brendon McCullum(c), Luke Ronchi(w), Corey Anderson, Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Kyle Mills, James Neesham, Adam Milne, Colin MunroWest Indies (From): Johnson Charles(w), Kieran Powell, Darren Bravo, Kirk Edwards, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo(c), Denesh Ramdin, Darren Sammy, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Jason Holder, Tino Best, Chadwick Walton, Narsingh Deonarine, Nikita MillerLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
