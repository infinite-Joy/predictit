Mahela Jayawardene is on strike. Brett Lee will open the attackRight, the players are back onto the field. Mahela will take strike and Lee will bowl the first ball. Should be an easy win for Lanka, going by what their openers did in the previous match. But...Sri Lanka hold the upper hand at the innings break and will be confident of chasing this total down on a slow wicket. Do join us shortly for the run chaseSo Australia's innings comes to an end three balls before the quota of fifty overs and it wouldn't be unfair to say that Sri Lanka really dominated that session of play. The hosts started off quite steadily and were looking oncourse to getting a score well above 250, but a couple of quick wickets in the middle overs led to a miniature collapse. Australia were quickly reduced to 134/5 owing to some good bowling by Herath and Maharoof. In fact Maharoof's slower delivery was almost unplayable today as most batsmen failed to pick it up. At the end Brett Lee and McKay soldiered on and somehow managed to drag Australia's score to a respectable 231.4

It has been fun to captain this side. We did not defend well in the last game and we have worked out on that. Wade and Warner will open. Lyon and Forrest come into the team instead of Pattinson and Clarke. We are looking forward to a great game.Mahela: We will bowl first, our combination makes us better chasers. Dilshan gives the perfect balance to our team. We always go into the middle believing that we can win against any team. We will go in with a positive attitude.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report:  It is a much warmer afternoon today. The pitch looks a lot drier. It will be difficult to chase on this track. The pitch will be a lot slower and the bounce will become inconsistent as the match wears on. Batting first should be ideal for the team winning the toss. The experts feel that both teams will look to add some extra spin options.Hello and Welcome to the live coverage of the third final of the CB series. The teams are even at 1-1 in the best of three finals and this match is likely to be as exciting as the first two, and the rest of the tournament. Clarke and James Pattinson have been ruled out for Australia, Shane Watson will captain them today. Nathan Lyon will debut for Australia. Stay tuned for the toss and pitch reportPreview by Karthik LakshmananThe roller-coaster ride called the CB series is finally coming to an end, and fittingly, the two best teams have stretched it till the last game possible. Twelve league games plus a best of three finals seemed too lengthy when it started, but the quality of cricket and the nail-biting finishes has sure made the tournament a thourough entertainer. It is all coming to an end though, and aptly, it's a battle of equals as Australia take on Sri Lanka at Adelaide. The two teams have a lot of similarities - their openers are in form, the bowling attacks look slightly weak, and both are plagued by injuries to key players. Sri Lanka: A month back, not many gave Sri Lanka a chance to do well in the tournament. They came into the series after a string of losses which led to changes in leadership including the captain and coach. The first two games did nothing to change that perception either - Sri Lanka competed, but failed. But a thrilling tie with India proved to be a turning point, as the Lankans finished the league stages losing only one more game. The fact that the Sri Lankans have been the best team in the tournament is there for everyone to see - their victories have been convincing, and losses, marginal. The trend continued into the first final as well - they almost made an unbelievable fightback to make what seemed an easy win for Australia a tight finish at Brisbane, and drew level at Adelaide after thrashing Australia with an eight wicket victory. Sri Lanka's big wins have been made possible by their top order, which starts with their captain. Jayawardene, Dilshan, Sangakkara, Chandimal and Thirimanne have been in excellent form and have made runs consistently. They rely a lot on the all-rounders, and despite injury blows to Perera, Maharoof and Angelo Matthews, the replacements seem to be doing a decent job. Tharanga in particular adapted well to his new role in the lower-middle order, which lessens the problems for the visitors. The problems for Sri Lanka have been their bowling. Their lead bowler Lasith Malinga has been inconsistent, but seemed to hit a good rhythm in the previous game. A bowling attack which relies a lot on medium-pace all-rounders, Sri Lanka do seem to miss the likes of Perera and Matthews, but the slow pitch at Adelaide suits their spinners, as was evident in the last game when Dilshan opened the attack. Sri Lanka dropped quite a few catches in that match, and will look for one final disciplined show in the same venue. Australia: Like their opponents, Australia too have a lot of injury worries, which starts from their captain. Michael Clarke rushed his comeback and made a century in the last game, but has been ruled out of the final clash (and the West Indies ODIs) because of a hamstring injury. The other casuality is fast bowler James Pattinson, who has been ruled out with a glute muscle strain. David Warner has a groin strain, but managed to score back to back centuries despite that. He has found good support from the other top order batsmen, but Australia will miss Clarke's batting more than his captaincy. The middle order - led by the Hussey brothers - has been in fine form too, but Australia will expect a bit more from Watson's bat. Australia's bowling attack has a good balance - Lee provides pace, while the likes of McKay, Christian and Watson provide medium pace options. Add to this a left arm spinner, and the hosts have a well balanced and varied attack. But the wicket at Adelaide is more suited to teams from the sub continent, and as they found out in the previous game, Australia need to do the damage with the bat more than the ball. Final word: It has been a lengthy but enjoyable tri series, which has done a lot to reinforce the interest in the 50 over format. Sri Lanka have been the best side so far, but Australia are not far behind either. It's hard to predict who will win, all we can hope for is one final thriller.
