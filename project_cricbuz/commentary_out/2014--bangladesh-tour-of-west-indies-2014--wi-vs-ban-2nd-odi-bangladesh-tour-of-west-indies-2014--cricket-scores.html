J Holder will open the attackWelcome back.. The players are out in the middle and we are set for the run-chase...At the toss, skipper Dwayne Bravo said anything around 250 would be good on this surface and I guess he'd be happy to see 247 on the board. Though Kirk Edwards' off pole went cartwheeling early on, Chris Gayle played well to score a 50 after 10 ODIs. Darren Bravo got his eye in and he too registered a fifty. Though Denesh Ramdin failed to convert the start, Kieron Pollard hit some lusty blows to up the ante. Lendl Simmons struggled throughout and Mortaza's final over, in which he got two wickets without conceding a run, put the brakes on the scoring and West Indies have finished 10 runs shorter than what they would have probably got. Mortaza was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets, Al-Amin picked up two but he was expensive, while Gazi and Mahmudullah bagged one each. Take a break and join us back for what promises to be an interesting second half.4
