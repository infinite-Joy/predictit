Gunathilaka then found an able ally in Kusal Mendis to engineer a 100-plus stand for the 2nd wicket before rain interrupted play. After 2 hours of waiting, the game resumed and so did Sri Lanka's aggro approach. The duo, however, departed in quick succession as Rashid rediscovered his rhythm. Despite the unfriendly conditions, the leggie bowled with a lot of guile and character. Thereafter, Chandimal came in, nudged and nurdled before unleashing along with the skip.

SRI LANKA:36.4 Willey to Chandimal, out Bowled!! Timbah! A crucial moment in the game.

SRI LANKA:28.5 Moeen Ali to Mathews, 1 run, full toss and Mathews has missed out, he was early into the swing to the leg-side, gets a leading edge that loops over backward point. That should have been put into the stands
SRI LANKA:28.4 Moeen Ali to Mathews, SIX, this was what he was looking for on the first ball of the over. Crouched a bit to get under the off-break and once he got underneath it, he nailed it over cow corner for a maximum

SRI LANKA:28.2 Moeen Ali to Mathews, 1 run, pushed through on off, eased off the back foot to long-on

SRI LANKA:26.5 Moeen Ali to Mathews, 1 run, Moeen Ali might have got away with one. A nice juicy full toss, Mathews had prempted the sweep, hits it hard and straight to deep backward square. Plunkett does well in the deep
SRI LANKA:26.4 Moeen Ali to Mathews, 2 runs, flatter and on the stumps, flicked away between deep backward square and deep mid-wicket for a brace. That was placed to perfection

SRI LANKA:23.2 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, out Caught by Moeen Ali!! Rashid at it again. Second wicket for him and the set batsman has to depart. It was cleverly bowled from the leggie. He saw the batsman giving himself room, hence followed him with a quicker, fuller one, Gunathilaka didn't have the room to free his arms and ends up scooping it wide of mid-off. Moeen Ali had a fair bit of ground to cover, he does so with ease. Gunathilaka c Moeen Ali b Adil Rashid 62(64) [4s-7]Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

SRI LANKA:22.1 Moeen Ali to Chandimal, SIX, fabulous shot! This is how you should play an off-spinner. Dances down the wicket, gets right to the pitch of the ball and smokes it with the turn over deep mid-wicket. Went all the way into the crowd

SRI LANKA:20.6 Moeen Ali to Chandimal, 1 run, twirls his wrists and nudges it to deep mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:20.5 Moeen Ali to Gunathilaka, 1 run, that will go down as a chance. It was a tough one and Moeen Ali did well to get a hand. Gunathilaka once more moved to the leg-side and drilled the drive to the right of the bowler, Ali dived and got more than a finger to it. However, it was hit hard and he couldn't hang on
SRI LANKA:20.4 Moeen Ali to Gunathilaka, 2 runs, touch short in length and just outside off, Gunathilaka waits for the ball to arrive and carves it past the backward point fielder. By the time sweeper tidies up the duo come back for the second

SRI LANKA:19.4 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, out Caught by Plunkett!! A fine knock comes to an end via a terrific catch. The duo had come out with a set plan; that is to attack from the word go. The loopy leggie from Rashid which is well outside off, Mendis went down on one knee to sweep it over mid-wicket, the turn took the ball away from the bat and he hit it towards long-off. Plunkett runs forward, dives full length and latches onto it. Made sure the ball didn't pop out as he hit the ground.

SRI LANKA:19.2 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, 1 run, this time Rashid follows him as he makes room, squeezed out to long-on
SRI LANKA:19.1 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, FOUR, nice way to greet Rashid. Backs away to the leg-side, opens up his shoulders, goes up and over mid-off. Even though it was a mishit, he got enough to clear the fielderHales will not take the field and will only bat if required at No. 7. So, that is not good news for England. He is the man in form and they would have counted on him in a shortened game...
SRI LANKA:18.6 Moeen Ali to Gunathilaka, 1 run, fifty for Gunathilaka. A well-compiled knock. A much needed one for Sri Lanka after losing Perera early. Quicker and angled in from round the wicket, punched to long-off

SRI LANKA:18.2 Moeen Ali to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, flatter and on the stumps, tucked away to mid-wicketThe players are all set to resume. Gunathilaka and Mendis will look to carry on their partnership, while England would have regrouped during the break and will come out with new strategies. Revised playing conditions: two bowlers can bowl 9 overs and three can bowl 8. Hales is still not on the field, he hobbled off after running across to stop a ball near the boundary rope. Moeen Ali to continue...16:25 Local Time, 15:25 GMT, 20:55 IST: Good news folks! Game to start at 16:30 local. It will be a 43-over contest and the innings break will be only for 10 minutes. So, after over two hours of rain, we have lost just 14 overs in total. There is news coming in that the game is further reduced to 42 overs.16:08 Local Time, 15:08 GMT, 20:38 IST: Huh! Finally some respite. As mentioned earlier, there's no rain and the groundsmen have decided - It's time to remove the covers. More updates as and when we get it, don't go away...We might start at 16:30 local with a possibility of 40-42 overs per-side game - And all that will be confirmed once the scheduled inspection is done which is at 16:20 local15:45 Local Time, 14:45 GMT, 20:15 IST: All that I can draw from a bundle load of tweets is that - Firstly, it ain't raining now but, but... The conditions are murky prompting the groundstaff to keep the covers and some of the crowd have started to leave the ground. F-R-U-S-T-R-A-T-I-N-G times. And guess what! M(ahela) J has just tweeted "Still raining"BBC just tweeted: "Still a bit drizzly, and the outfield is greasy. Umpires will have another look as soon as the rain stops."15:13 Local Time, 14:13 GMT, 19:43 IST: Sit back, have a cuppa and keep praying. We've reached that point of time where we start losing overs...14:41 Local Time, 13:41 GMT, 19:11 IST: The drizzle-mizzle continues...As if that wasn't enough, there are some dark, thick clouds hovering around making it look more ominous.14:19 Local Time, 13:19 GMT, 18:49 IST: The umpires finally had enough. The players are being taken off and the covers are coming on. The big hover cover is sliding over the playing surface. Hopefully, it will stop and we will resume soon. However, remember it has to stop completely for the umpires to bring the players back on the field.
SRI LANKA:18.1 Moeen Ali to Kusal Mendis, FOUR, expertly done. Moeen Ali pushes it through as he is not able to grip the ball, Mendis waits and steers it late past short third man, raced away across the wet outfieldThe drizzle has got heavier, but not heavy enough for the umpires to stop play. We will continue as of now..

SRI LANKA:17.3 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, FOUR, an acrobatic dive from Plunkett almost saved four for England. Flighted outside off, Mendis drives it hard and to the left of long-off. Plunkett did all the hard work of getting there, but the dive and momentum of it takes the ball along to the rope
SRI LANKA:17.2 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, 1 run, worked away with the turn to square leg
SRI LANKA:17.1 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, top edge and safe. Slider on the stumps, Mendis crouches low to pull, doesn't expect it bounce much and hence gets a fat edge and luckily it lands safely near short fine legTime for a drink. After that early hara-kiri (Kusal Perera's run out) it has been classy and flashy from Sri Lanka. Classy courtesy Kusal Mendis' awe-inspiring strokes. Flashy because Gunathilaka has been edgy at times. Running between the wickets has been the only area of concern
SRI LANKA:16.6 Moeen Ali to Gunathilaka, no run, confusion and Kusal Mendis would have been a goner had there been a direct hit. Gunathilaka taps this to cover-point and both instantly decide on a quick single, sees the fielder swooping in and then Gunathilaka yells "no." Kusal Mendis rushes back and puts in the dive, the throw wasn't that accurate either
SRI LANKA:16.5 Moeen Ali to Gunathilaka, no run, pushed through, a tad quicker on leg-stump, Gunathilaka negates it into the leg-side

SRI LANKA:15.6 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, FOUR, oh lord! This man has been batting like he owns the ground, like he owns every moment, like he owns every delivery coming at him. Such confidence, tossed up just outside off - Mendis sinks to one knee and loft-drives it up and over extra cover, played!
SRI LANKA:15.5 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, no run, the leggie that spun away late, Mendis flashes it straight to backward point
SRI LANKA:15.4 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, no run, flat and straight, driven back

SRI LANKA:14.6 Moeen Ali to Kusal Mendis, FOUR, short again and this has been punished. Had enough time to dance back and blast the pull through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:14.5 Moeen Ali to Kusal Mendis, 2 runs, plenty of width on offer, Mendis sits back and cracks the cut to deep backward point. 100 up for Sri Lanka. Hales seems to be in some discomfort as he wobbles to field the ball
SRI LANKA:14.4 Moeen Ali to Gunathilaka, 1 run, full and dipping in at the toes, tucked along the ground through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:14.3 Moeen Ali to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, too straight and that's been helped away towards long leg
SRI LANKA:14.2 Moeen Ali to Gunathilaka, 1 run, flatter at 56mph, Gunathilaka opens the bat face and smothers it towards cover
SRI LANKA:14.1 Moeen Ali to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, shortish on middle, pulled and Roy could only take the pace off that at short mid-wicket. Couldn't prevent the single thoughMoeen Ali, right-arm off break, comes into the attackStrong breeze coming across the ground as Moeen Ali prepares to bowl...
SRI LANKA:13.6 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, and Mendis continues to impress - A half-century and a well-deserved one for him. Floated straight, Mendis stays legside and gets inside the line of the delivery to drive it down to long-off. It's been all classy from this bloke
SRI LANKA:13.5 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, 1 run, spinning in around the pads, Gunathilaka clips to mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:13.4 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, quicker one just outside off, Mendis drives and slots it through extra cover
SRI LANKA:13.3 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, 1 run, flicked off the pads behind square
SRI LANKA:13.2 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, FOUR, SL having nothing to lose. They certainly seem to have come with a plan and a positive one. Not sparing anything that's average or below - Short one and Gunathilaka had enough time to rock back and murder the pull through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:13.1 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, FOUR, that's a gimme. Slow, short, wide - Gunathilaka leans on his back leg and spanks the drive through the covers. No chance for the man in the deep
SRI LANKA:12.6 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, no run, blocked
SRI LANKA:12.5 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, 1 run, just an action replay of Perera's dismissal. The only differences were, the fielder didn't hit the stumps and Willey was the fielder. Would have been close had that hit, the duo think about sneaking an overthrow but decide against it
SRI LANKA:12.5 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, wide, looks to angle it in, the bouncer that is, Gunathilaka doesn't bother
SRI LANKA:12.4 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, 2 runs, fraction short and wide, Gunathilaka opens the bat face at last instant and directs it down towards third manPlunkett switches to round the wicket now
SRI LANKA:12.3 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, 88mph, short and rising around hip height, Mendis tickles it to square leg and rushes for a single
SRI LANKA:12.2 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, no run, on and around off this time, bunted into the pitch
SRI LANKA:12.1 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, no run, the machinery stuff continues from Liam Plunkett, 84mph short of length on middle and leg. Smothered away towards mid-on
SRI LANKA:11.6 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, lots of air on this legbreak, slapped away square on the off-side
SRI LANKA:11.5 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, no run, looks to drive straight but the away turn meant, it skewed off the inside half towards mid-on
SRI LANKA:11.4 Adil Rashid to Kusal Mendis, no run, slightly short and spinning away, Mendis opens up slightly and goes too hard on the drive. And hence the timing's messed up and chopped into the covers
SRI LANKA:11.3 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, 1 run, nudged away towards mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:11.2 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, FOUR, nice and sensible from Danushka Gunathilaka. Saw mid-off was inside the ring, jumps down the pitch like a bull in pamplona and lofts it straight, got to the pitch and placed it over the fielder
SRI LANKA:11.1 Adil Rashid to Gunathilaka, no run, drifting in straight, Gunathilaka stays in his crease and blocksAdil Rashid, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackTime for some spin. Rashid, the leggie, has been in good rhythm of late
SRI LANKA:10.6 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, 1 run, drops this short of length delivery at his toes and sees his partner sprinting. Run Gunathilaka run...easily done in the end
SRI LANKA:10.5 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, worked into the mid-wicket pocket
SRI LANKA:10.4 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, no run, what is Liam Plunkett upto? "This fellow has been running in and just bowling like a machine" wonders my colleague Ramakrishnan. Good length on off, no rythm, blocked
SRI LANKA:10.3 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, 1 run, hangs back and angles it towards the gully region and squeezes a quick single
SRI LANKA:10.2 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, opens the blade and taps it past backward point, sensible stuff from Mendis
SRI LANKA:10.1 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, FOUR, that ball has four written all over it, the moment it left the blade, the moment Mendis decided to lean on his front foot and stroked the drive. Scorched through the covers, nuff said
SRI LANKA:9.6 Woakes to Gunathilaka, FOUR, overcompensates and bowls a dross, down leg and that's been tickled past a diving short fine. Adil Rashid's the fielder
SRI LANKA:9.5 Woakes to Gunathilaka, no run, back of a length drifting towards top of off, Gunathilaka is early into his pull stroke. Misses and is pinged around his thigh
SRI LANKA:9.4 Woakes to Gunathilaka, no run, slanted in late off a good length, Gunathilaka wrists it towards mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:9.3 Woakes to Gunathilaka, no run, length outside off, punched defensively into the off-sideThere's lot of fuss about rain and the groundstaff...So you know what's coming

SRI LANKA:8.4 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, no run, pacy full ball outside off, driven straight to mid-off
SRI LANKA:8.4 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, wide, first bouncer of the day and that's arrowed down the wrong line, too high may be. Mendis ducked days early
SRI LANKA:8.3 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, 1 run, tucked off the pads towards deep backward square
SRI LANKA:8.2 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, leg byes, 1 run, slanted into the pads, a stifled appeal for leg before but that's comfortably sneaking down leg. The duo pinch a leg bye as the ball rolls slowly towards cover
SRI LANKA:8.1 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, no run, chopped and another day it would have gone onto hit the timbers. Mendis was too far inside the crease and he wanted to push this into the off-side perhaps. Played it a little too late and hence the edgeThe drizzled has eased as of now. It's breezy...
SRI LANKA:7.6 Woakes to Gunathilaka, no run, attacks the stumps, played back
SRI LANKA:7.5 Woakes to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, "no swing no seam" yelps Nass. as Mendis tickles a length delivery around the corner

SRI LANKA:7.2 Woakes to Gunathilaka, no run, defended modestly towards short coverKusal Perera is seen sitting and staring - In the dressing room obviously - Looks like a schoolboy who missed out on a picnic bus. Tell you what! Run out is the worst feeling and if you're an opener, there's nothing worse
SRI LANKA:7.1 Woakes to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, hits the deck hard on a short length, Mendis drops it into the pitch on the leg-side
SRI LANKA:6.6 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, no run, length outside off, no shot offered
SRI LANKA:6.5 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, no run, a silky drive towards cover but hang on! What's happening out there? Gunathilaka's bat is broken? Oh, what! Yes, it loooks kinda out of shape, the toe to be precise. The sub is on the field with a set of new blades. Okay! Gunathilaka is doctoring a couple of them now, finally picks one and practices a few shadow strokes. We are ready to go...
SRI LANKA:6.4 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, FOUR, poor bowling this from England. This has been the umpteenth ball that has been sparayed on the pads, Gunathilaka flicks and he just had to beat short fine. Did so by some distance...
SRI LANKA:6.3 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, no run, angled away on goodish length, Gunathilaka lifts his bat and lets it goThe drizzle is getting heavier as both umpires have a look at each other. We might be off soon, MIGHT
SRI LANKA:6.2 Plunkett to Gunathilaka, no run, legstump-ish lines, flicked straight to short fine
SRI LANKA:6.1 Plunkett to Kusal Mendis, 1 run, bowls a cross-seam delivery first up, easy peasy for Mendis who clips square on the on-sideLiam Plunkett, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackRight then! Here's Plunkett, only one slip

SRI LANKA:5.5 Woakes to Kusal Mendis, no run, stays in his crease and drops it at his feetMorgan has a chat with Woakesey. Might be regarding the field placements
SRI LANKA:5.4 Woakes to Kusal Mendis, FOUR, and now he follows it up with a classy straight drive. On the stumps and Mendis just had to put bat to ball, he did so with sheer confidence and the timing did the rest
SRI LANKA:5.3 Woakes to Kusal Mendis, FOUR, jeez! Mendis is in some mood to punish the bad deliveries - Not letting that go scot-free. Good length but wide enough for Mendis to punch it past point, timing at its very bestPlunkett, the bearded bloke is off the field. Might have been off for a casual break.

I hate to inform this - Today will be one of those days fellas! RAIN-WAIT-RAIN-WAIT. Will be a test of our patience and groundsmen's mopping up skills. So, you better be prepared for a shortened game. The latest we are hearing is: 18:15 local is the cut-off time for a 20-over gameTeams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Seekkuge Prasanna, Upul Tharanga, Dasun Shanaka, Farveez Maharoof, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan PradeepEngland (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Adil RashidEngland have won the toss and have opted to fieldAfter putting up back-to-back ordinary performances in the last two ODIs, where the entire top order ended up getting starts but failed to carry it forward, they would need to pull up their socks to put up a fight against an inspired England side. On a ground where they've enjoyed reasonable success in the past, let us hope that the dark clouds stay away and give us an entire game. Well, the good news is that the drizzle has now given way to sunshine and the covers are off the ground to make way for the two captains at the toss..Hello and a very warm welcome to our coverage of the fourth One Day International from The Oval. On a day the ICC big wigs meet in order to discuss the relevance and the future of ODIs, let us hope that we end up getting a contest worthy of a probable decider, or a contest at least given how gloomy the skies are out there in London. After being one down in the series, the Lankan hopes rest on today's contest in order to keep their hopes alive of getting a sweet result on a pretty bitter tour so far. Preview:Three One Day Internationals (ODIs), and three different outcomes - a tie, an England win and a washout. As England and Sri Lanka gear up for the penultimate ODI of the series, at the Kia Oval in London, it's a do-or-die situation for Angelo Mathews's team. After an underwhelming performance in the Tests, Sri Lanka were expected to put up a better performance in the shorter formats of the game, arguably their better suit. After three games, they find themselves 1-0 down, after they were comprehensively beaten by a record 10-wicket margin in the second game at Edgbaston. Wednesday's (June 29) game presents them one final opportunity to keep their hopes of a series win alive.While England have already secured the 'Super Series', there's a lot to play for in the fourth match. A win will confirm the ODI series for them, adding another feather to the cap for a team that's being hailed for its 'aggressive cricket', with Michael Vaughan, the former England captain, even suggesting that the day isn't too far ahead when England would be the world champions in this format of the game.Morgan has emphasized on continuity and that's exactly what the hosts will aim to achieve at The Oval. The batting has been solid, with openers Jason Roy and Alex Hales amongst runs. Barring the first ODI, the middle-order hasn't been tested much while the bowling has been disciplined, with spinner, Adil Rashid, being particularly impressive.The weather interruptions apart, the hosts have been performing at a notch higher when compared to their opponents. Sri Lanka have struggled at the top, with Kusal Perera and Danushka Gunathilaka barely managing to register a decent start. It has invariably put the middle order under immense pressure. Dinesh Chandimal and Mathews have responded well, but there's a shaky feeling to the late middle order, despite the runs from Upul Tharanga's bat. While the batsmen haven't helped their cause, the bowling and fielding has been largely untidy, barring the first ODI in Trent Bridge.The think-tank has tinkered around with the batting line-up. Seekkuge Prasanna has been used as a floater in the middle, but barring his 28-ball 59 at Trent Bridge, the ploy hasn't worked much. Dasun Shanaka and Suraj Randiv have been rotated around, again with little reward. Still searching for a settled combination, the visitors can't afford to twiddle around any further. There is also the small matter of the International Cricket Council (ICC) ODI rankings as well. A win on Wednesday will put Sri Lanka above England in fifth position, while a reverse result will open up a two-point gap between the teams.When: England vs Sri Lanka, 4th ODI on June 29 at 13:00 PM Local Time, 5:30 PM ISTWhere: Kia Oval, LondonWhat to expect: Rain has followed the two teams so far in the ODI leg of the tour and the forecast for Wednesday isn't the most promising one. Heavy rain is expected to sweep the city. It should be a cool and breezy day with temperatures expected to hover at around 16 degree Celsius.Team News:England: On the small Bristol outfield, England dropped Moeen Ali, going for the extra pace option of Chris Jordan. The Sussex pacer might retain his place after an impressive outing as he bowled exceptionally well in the death.Sri Lanka: Upul Tharanga has been Sri Lanka's finisher, but there has been a feeling in the camp that he has been wasted down the order. With the openers struggling, the southpaw might well get a promotion up the order. Prasanna has struggled with the ball and might make way for allrounder Dhananjaya de Silva.Did you know?- England have a 3-2 advantage over Sri Lanka in ODIs at Kennington Oval, with no team winning two consecutive matches here.- After being down at 82 for six in the first ODI, England have scored 476 runs since, losing just three wickets.- The partnerships between Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews in ODIs in 2016 read 93, 88, 64, 82 and 80.- The highest score by anyone from Sri Lanka's current squad at Kennington Oval is 31 by Dinesh Chandimal against Australia in 2013 Champions Trophy.- Eoin Morgan has scored 388 runs in nine innings at Kennington Oval at 55.42 and a strike rate of 110.54 with three fifties.Who said what:'We're building a lot of momentum towards where we want to be. We are being harsh on ourselves and want to be the best' - England captain, Eoin Morgan, isn't just looking at completing a series win against Sri Lanka.Teams:England (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, David Willey, Liam Plunkett, Chris Jordan, Adil Rashid, Moeen Ali, Steven Finn, James VinceSri Lanka (From): Kusal Perera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Seekkuge Prasanna, Upul Tharanga, Dasun Shanaka, Farveez Maharoof, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep, Dhananjaya de Silva, Suraj RandivLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
