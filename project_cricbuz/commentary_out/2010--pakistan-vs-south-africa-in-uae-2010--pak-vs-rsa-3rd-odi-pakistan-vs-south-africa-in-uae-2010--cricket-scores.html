Morkel will open the attackWelcome back. Botha is seen giving his team a pep talk. Can they defend this?It has been a top class effort by Pak. Amla has stood tall amidst ruins to help SA construct a somewhat respectable total. Pakistan looked a completely different outfit on the field today, with Shoaib firing on all cylinders right at the top. He was supported superbly by Riaz and the spinners who chipped in with wickets in the middle, Duminy looked solid for a brief while but once he was gone, the middle order crumbled. de Villiers was extremely unfortunate to have been given out stumped while replays confirmed that his backfoot was planted well inside the crease while the bails were clipped off. Afridi was imaginative in his captaincy and did well to keep shuffling the bowlers and not let the batsmen settle at any point in time. Can Pak chase this down with ease or will they be made to sweat it out. Join us at 8:40 PM IST for the chase.4

We are just a few minutes away from the start of play. Stay tuned..Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Farhat, Younis Khan, Asad Shafiq, Fawad Alam, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Zulqarnain Haider(w), Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib AkhtarSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, David Miller, Albie Morkel, Johan Botha(c), Morne Morkel, Juan Theron, Lonwabo TsotsobeBreaking News: Makhaya Ntini has retired from International cricket.Botha: Hopefully we can put the 2nd ODI behind us and perform well.

Razzaq was brilliant in the 2nd ODI, hopefully he will perform well in this game as well. Farhat comes in today.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to fieldHello and welcome to the live coverage of the third ODI between Pakistan and South Africa coming to you from Dubai. After a cliffhanger at Abu Dhabi, Pakistan would be brimming with confidence, but the Proteas would like to believe that they can beat Pak if they play to their potential. Stay connected for the toss and team updatesby Vishaal LoganathanIt may have taken Pakistan a while to get back to winning ways, but when they did win it was nothing short of spectacular. While the victory may not have nudged them into the favorites category, it certainly would have showed the world how capable they are of turning a match on its head when it seems all but over. Well, the win in Abu Dhabi was thanks mostly to the brilliance or belligerence, I must say, of one man, Abdul Razzaq. He ensured he gave his country something to cheer about by carrying his team to victory from an almost impossible state.The victory showcased many of Pakistan's characteristics; the number of quality match winners in the side, their never-say-die attitude and their ability to bounce back strongly when they seem down and out. After a long time, the batsmen came out trumps as the Pak bowlers struggled against the Proteas' batting. The bowling was undone by some good work by Ingram and Amla but they did very well to pick up wickets at regular intervals at the end to restrict South Africa to less than 300. Battingwise, the likes of Afridi, Alam and Hafeez contributed with valuable cameos, but they will be disappointed after they were unable to convert the victory into a more comfortable one.For the Proteas, it might turn out to be case of how soon they get over the Razzaq onslaught. Just when it seemed like they had another win in their bag, Razzaq snatched it away with an innings of a lifetime. They didn't do much wrong and were in the game till the very end, and if it weren't for the Pak all rounder they would've been 2-0 up in his series.Their batting did brilliantly to post a power score, with Ingram and Amla top scoring. Ingram has been a terrific find for the Proteas, and he displayed again why they need him at the World Cup with a superb century. Their bowling too was on track until Razzaq chose to start going on the counter.Albie Morkel is one South African who'd want a much better showing after not clicking with the bat and then being mauled by Razzaq when bowling. He had given away 52 runs in less than 5 overs including the last one of the match in which Razzaq smashed 2 sixes and a four.The victory for Pakistan has certainly added more spark into the series now, and many would follow this match at Dubai keenly. Pakistan fans would certainly be hoping that the victory was no flash in the pan while the Proteas will want to put the defeat in the second ODI behind them and get back into groove as quickly as possible.Teams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Shahzaib Hasan, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Fawad Alam, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Zulqarnain Haider(w), Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Abdur Rehman, Asad Shafiq, Imran Farhat, Tanvir Ahmed, Umar Akmal, Umar GulSouth Africa (From): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, David Miller, Johan Botha, Morne Morkel, Juan Theron, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Albie Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Charl LangeveldtLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
