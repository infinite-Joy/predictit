Win the toss and bowl first," says Jonty RhodesNetherlands have won the toss and have opted to batAlready burdened with the crumbling team management and political situation, today's match against Netherlands provides Zimbabwe the final opportunity to save face and stay alive in the tournament. They began their campaign on a jittery note, losing their warm-up games. Their first game against Ireland was a last ball thriller. Despite fighting back with a sensational bowling display, a missed run-out chance on the final ball cost them the match. On the other hand, Netherlands are currently at the no. 1 position in Group B. They achieved an easy victory over UAE on Tuesday and also have a better run-rate to boot. A win here will put them in an even stronger position to advance towards the main draw. Can they beat Zimbabwe and edge ahead? Or is there still some fight left in Zimbabwe? Let us find out. Hello and Welcome to the 7th match of the qualifiers between Zimbabwe and Netherlands at Sylhet.
