Pakistan would have had a satisfying lunch and will look for some desserts from the Bangla bowlers. Will Bangladesh have other ideas?Unpredictability is the name for Pakistan, and we saw it in this session of play. The bowlers did well to restrict Bangladesh to a modest 91. One thought that it will be an easy chase for the visitors, but they have contrived to make even easy chases look difficult at times. There would have been a flutter in their heart when they slipped to 44/4, but Misbah was cool as a cucumber and he has been joined by the pugnacious Umar Akmal. There is still some more work to be done, 34 runs to be precise and they would hope to achieve it without any more dramas. Join us at 17:10 IST for what should be a short session of play.

Will Pakistan finish this one before the supper break?Right, I, Sid V, am off the comm box. Pradeep will take you through for the Pakistan chase.Afridi has continued from where he left off in the UAE. His seventh five wicket haul has destroyed the Bangladeshis. The decision to employ Hafeez at the start was a master-stroke from Misbah as he sent back the dangerous Tamim Iqbal for a duck. The rest of the top order collapsed like a pack of cards. Shakib and Nasir Hossain strung a partnership but once Nasir departed, the lower order offered little resistance. Join us in a short while for the run-chase.Afridi: I enjoy doing something for the team. I love to improve and learn a lot. I started my career as a bowler and I am taking good advice from Rameez. The coaching staff are backing me and I enjoy taking their advice. For the last 3-4 years, I have been the top wicket taker from my side and I feel happy. Every game is a new game for us and we have to focus on each and every game. After retiring from Tests, I am enjoying playing T20s and ODIs.3
