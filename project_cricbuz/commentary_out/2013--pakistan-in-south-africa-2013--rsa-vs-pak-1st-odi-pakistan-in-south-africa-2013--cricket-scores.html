Umar Akmal didn't grab the ball but it ricocheted onto the stumps off his gloves just in time to have Smith short. The batsman makes room and again tries to cut, he drags his back foot outside the crease and in the process of trying to get back, he lifts the foot and that is when Akmal's fumble dislodged the bail. The umpire had a long look and ruled in favour of the visitors. So Hafeez continues to enjoy bowling against left-handers. Graeme Smith st U Akmal b Hafeez 12(16) [4s-2] Hafeez to Graeme Smith, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!Third umpire called for a stumping check. Well, has he managed to drag his foot back in time?

Graeme Smith is on strike. Junaid Khan will open the attackTwo slips in place.Welcome back for the chase.It looked like Pakistan were going to be bowled out under 150-160, but debutant Bilawal Bhatti and Anwar Ali combined really well for the 8th wicket to share a 74-run stand and help their side get a respectable score. The top-order once again collapsed to some good bowling from South Africa. Nasir Jamshed and Ahmed Shehzad got off to a very sedate start, but Dale Steyn found the outside edge of Jamshed to open the floodgates. None of the batsman in the top-order were willing to spend time and the visitors were reduced to 131/7 in the 36th over. But since then, Ali and Bhatti played sensibly and accelerated towards the end to bail Pakistan out of trouble. Steyn and Morkel bagged three wickets each while Kallis, in his comeback match, grabbed two. South Africa should chase this down quite easily but you never know what will happen in this funny game. Join us back for the second innings in a short while.4

First the riveting action from the Ashes, then the India v West Indies game that has just started and now South Africa lock horns with Pakistan in the first of the 3-match ODI series. The Proteas thrashed Pakistan 4-1 back in the UAE just recently and are pretty confident to do well in their own backyard as well. Pakistan's batting is something to look out for. Captain Misbah-ul-Haq is under serious pressure after all those losses. Critics are already calling for his axing as the results are not coming Pakistan's way. The Mohammad Hafeez-led Pakistan shared the T20I series 1-1 a few days ago and the side will look to take some positives out of that and do well in the 50-over format. Can they turn the tables around this time? Let's wait and see, hello and welcome for the first ODI in Cape Town. It would be interesting to see the playings XIs of both the sides. Stay tuned for the toss, it's all coming your way shortly.The Preview, by PradeepPakistan and South Africa will be up against each other once again, for the 12th time this year as the first ODI kicks off at Cape Town. Call it an overdose, both teams know that the more number of ODIs they play, the better it is with the 2015 World Cup coming round the corner. The 3 ODIs are more vital for Pakistan rather than the hosts, this will be their last opportunity to play on surfaces that resemble the surfaces on which the World Cup will be played.Things are interesting from the hosts' perspective as well. Jacques Kallis, who last played a One Day match against New Zealand on February 29th, 2012. The versatile all-rounder has been closely monitored by the team management ever since the legendary all-rounder expressed his desire to feature in the 2015 WC. Kallis has won almost all the prizes that Test cricket offer, but he knows that his place amongst the echelons of cricketers can be sealed only by winning the big slice of cake that cricket can offer, the Cricket World Cup.Cape Town is also the home city of Kallis, and it will be only appropriate that the home town makes his comeback into the shorter format of the game in front of his supporters.South Africa: While the ODI series against Pakistan was arranged in haste, South Africa know that these three games will help evaluate their position ahead of more difficult series coming up against India and Australia. They just beat Pakistan by an impressive 4-1 margin in the just concluded ODI series at the UAE, and will start firm favourites. With the addition of Kallis, the hosts suddenly look extremely strong in all the departments of the game. Graeme Smith, who missed out of the ODI matches with a head injury, is also back into the reckoning. With the batting loaded with heavy-weights, the hosts should be considered as the massive favourites.With Dale Steyn back to his peak form in the UAE ODIs, the bowling attack looks incisive and threatening. Lonwabo Tsotsobe and Morne Morkel have formed an excellent support cast. Pakistan struggled against the spin of Imran Tahir who has quickly established himself as the lead spinner. Add to their superlative fielding. South Africa have all the bases covered as they head into their home season.Pakistan: The visitors halted their six match losing streak by beating the Proteas in the second T20I at this very ground. With the World Cup closing by, the visitors will recognise these matches as valuable match practise in overseas conditions. Pakistan's problem has been their lacklustre batting in recent times. Shoiab Maqsood played only 2 ODIs and he was the most impressive of the Pakistan batsmen, notching up 2 fifties. Ahmed Shahzad and Misbh-ul-Haq were consistent, but the rest floundered to deceive.The likes of Umar Akmal and Umar Amin struggled, but the team management has shown their faith by retaining them in the squad.If the batting combination looks hazy, bowling continues to remain Pakistan's strong point. They will however miss the services of lanky pacer, Mohamad Irfan, who has left out after suffering a hip injury during the T20I series in Dubai. In his absence, the onus will be on the shoulders of Junaid Khan and Sohail Tanvir. Spin is Pakistan's forte and the combination of Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez can cause damage to the hosts.Pitch and Conditions: A sunny day is forecast for Cape Town and conditions should be warm and player friendly. The wicket at Cape Town is usually very good for batting.Quotes:There is no substitute for the experience he brings to the game - JP Duminy has welcomed the return of Jacques Kallis to the South Africa line-up.It's always great to do well for Pakistan and that I was able to contribute to the victory. Misbah is here and Shafiq is here so hopefully it all remains the same for the ODIs - Mohammad Hafeez, after Pakistan won the 2nd T20I.Teams:South Africa (From): Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Vernon PhilanderPakistan (From): Nasir Jamshed, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Saeed Ajmal, Abdur Rehman, Sohail Tanvir, Junaid Khan, Anwar Ali, Bilawal Bhatti, Asad Shafiq, Umar AminLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
