He has two slips in placeWelcome back..The New Zealand bowlers pulled things back after the dismissal of ABD, Southee and McClenaghan were excellent at the death. They varied their pace and used the slower ball bouncer to good effect. Vettori was once again at his wily best, giving away just 41 runs in his 10 overs. It is now upto the home team batsmen to chase this down and level the series. Join us in a short while to find out whether New Zealand draw level or South Africa win the series....New Zealand will be happy with the final score. At one stage it looked like South Africa will get 300 or more. They took the last 7 wickets for 48 runs. Amla and de Kock gave the visitors another solid start. Faf continued his rich vein of form after QdK's dismissal. He along with Amla added 113 for the 2nd wicket. ABD came in and played a cameo, but it was the Amla who held the innings together. The opener brought up his 16th ODI hundred and it was one of his hard fought knocks.4

David Miller has replaced Ryan McLaren. They have opted to strengthen their batting department.Two changes for the hosts. Mitchell McClenaghan and Tim Southee are in place of Nathan McCullum and Kyle Mills.New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to fieldA rusty New Zealand were no match to the efficient South Africans in Mount Maunganui's debut ODI on Tuesday. A fine 99 from wicket-keeper batsman, Luke Ronchi, helped New Zealand finish with 230 all-out. That score wasn't enough though, with AB de Villiers and JP Duminy, adding an unbeaten 139-run stand for the fifth wicket to seal victory. The two teams face-off once again at the same venue. A win will help South Africa clinch the series. On the other hand, New Zealand must play out of their skins to take this to the decider in Hamilton. Toss and team updates in a while..PreviewAfter suffering a crushing defeat in the opening game, hosts New Zealand will be looking to bounce back strongly and restore their pride. South Africa will be hoping for nothing less than continuing their good form. The series acts as a build-up to the World Cup and thus holds importance for players from both sides.New Zealand:Luke Ronchi's 99 was the highlight of the first game. His good form came as a huge morale-boost after the top order collapsed. New Zealand will need their big guns to fire and the batting department will definitely have to up their game.Tim Southee's return from injury adds some teeth to the attack. The bowling strength and variety has been one of the biggest assets for the Kiwis in the past couple of years. If everyone is in form then Boult, Southee, Vettori and Nathan McCullum will prove to be more than a handful for any batting line up in the world. The hosts will want their key performers to gain some confidence by doing well against a strong South African unit.South Africa:The Proteas will go into the World Cup as one of the favourites and it is no surprise that they put up a strong show in the first ODI. The batting unit has a perfect blend of youth and experience while the bowling department consists of some of the finest bowlers of the generation. South Africa will be using the series to test out the best combination ahead of the big tournament. The likes of Vernon Philander and Rilee Rossouw will be keen to seal a spot for themselves in the final eleven despite the stiff competition.Already 1-0 up in the series, South Africa will be looking forward to clinch the series as quickly as possible. The added incentive would be that South Africa have a chance to regain their No. 1 ranking in ODIs if they manage a clean sweep against New Zealand.QuotesBeing number one would be great but at the moment we are sticking to a good plan of winning as many as we can and taking each match with the importance that it has - Hashim AmlaTeams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Ryan McLaren, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Aaron Phangiso, Kyle AbbottNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, James Neesham, Dean Brownlie, Brendon McCullum(c), Tom Latham, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Trent Boult, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
