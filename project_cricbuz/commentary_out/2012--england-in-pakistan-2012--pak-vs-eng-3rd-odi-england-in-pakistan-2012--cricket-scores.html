KP would have been run out had it hit, and is not impressed with the keeper for that cheeky run out attempt!Hafeez is back into the attack

ENGLAND:9.5  Ajmal to Alastair Cook, FOUR, gets the cut shot right this time! Ajmal offers width and Cook crashes it between point and short third man for a boundary, that should release a bit of pressure created by the spinners
ENGLAND:9.4  Ajmal to Alastair Cook, no run, tossed up on the off, Cook defends this time
ENGLAND:9.3  Ajmal to Alastair Cook, no run, an appeal for lbw but Taufel says no. And Pakistan don't review it either. Cook misses a sweep, he is hit in line but the ball was just about clipping off stump, would have been umpire's call and umpire's call was not out!Round the wickets
ENGLAND:9.2  Ajmal to Pietersen, 1 run, uses his feet this time and works it to square leg, gets off strike

ENGLAND:8.6  Hafeez to Alastair Cook, no run, almost bowled! The spinners are trying to get him out bowled, once again fires it in fast and lures Cook into his favourite cut shot, he obliges and gets an inside edge onto the pitch, dangerous shot to play but he is surviving

ENGLAND:7.6  Ajmal to Alastair Cook, no run, lovely bowling, gives this a lot more flight and makes Cook defend, ends an excellent over

ENGLAND:6.2  Hafeez to Alastair Cook, FOUR, not the right place to bowl, especially when the field is up. Flat, short and wide outside off, Cook says thank you very much and cuts it between point and covers
ENGLAND:6.1  Hafeez to Alastair Cook, no run, tossed up on the off, Cook pushes it back to himMohammad Hafeez, right-arm off break, comes into the attack

ENGLAND:4.6  Umar Gul to Alastair Cook, no run, again outside off and again left alone, a better finish to the over as far as Gul is concerned

ENGLAND:4.2  Umar Gul to Alastair Cook, SIX, that's a huge hit! That's the way to deal with free-hits. Gul bowls a slow off cutter but Cook reads it well, stands in the crease and heaves it over deep mid wicket, goes some 10 rows into the stands
ENGLAND:4.2  Umar Gul to Alastair Cook, no ball, FOUR, this is almost unbelievable! Another no ball from Umar Gul, and what more, he has given a boundary this time! Full ball outside off, Cook stretches and drives it away from the body, gets it past extra cover for a boundary

ENGLAND:2.5  Umar Gul to Pietersen, 2 runs, Gul goes short but KP handles it well, gets onto the backfoot and pulls it to deep mid wicket for a couple
ENGLAND:2.4  Umar Gul to Alastair Cook, 1 run, almost chopped on! This was neither too wide nor too short for the cut shot but that is exactly what Cook tried, got a thick inside edge that missed the leg stump by a few inches.. Misbah has a look of shock on his face, that was very close indeed
ENGLAND:2.3  Umar Gul to Alastair Cook, no run, better from Gul, switches to the good length stuff and makes Cook defend

ENGLAND:0.6  Umar Gul to Pietersen, no run, a huge appeal for caught behind, but Aleem Dar says no. Pakistan think about a review but decide against it. Excellent ball, but no edge there. Back of length and angled in around off, straightens after pitching and goes past Pietersen as he pushes at it, Adnan Akmal was late in joining the appeal, but that wouldn't have matteredSome problems with the sight-screen..The 2 slips have disappeared as well!
ENGLAND:0.5  Umar Gul to Pietersen, no run, walks down the track this time in typical KP style and flicks it off his pads to square leg, he looks to be in a positive frame of mind today

ENGLAND:0.1  Umar Gul to Alastair Cook, 1 run, good start for both the batsman and the bowler. Gul starts with a length ball right on middle stump, Cook stays back and pushes it softly to mid on, calls for a quick single and gets it easilyAlastair Cook and Pietersen are at the crease. Alastair Cook is on strike. Umar Gul will open the attackWe're back for the chase. Misbah leads the men out and gets them into a huddle. The openers - Cook and KP - follow them. Cook is in terrific form with 2 back to back tons, but his partner needs some runs today. Can he?Which team will be happier during the break? England should be happy for restricting Pakistan, but they were 50 for 4 at one stage! Umar Akmal and Shahid Afridi - both known to be impatient, careless and excessively attacking - played according to the situation, scoring half centuries and taking the team to a decent score. Both of them got out just when Pakistan needed some big hits, but Gul provided them in the end and took them over the 200 run mark. Finn was the star (again!) for England and finished with 3-24 in his 10 overs. 223 is certainly not match winning, but Pakistan's bowlers have a decent score to work with. Join us in 30 minutes for the chase.4
PAKISTAN:49.6  Broad to Umar Gul, out Aizaz Cheema Run Out!! 1 run completed. That ends the Pakistan innings, and their quota of 50 overs. Gul jams this fuller one straight to deep mid wicket, Cheema wants 2 but Gul slipped while completing the first run, the throw went to the keeper's end and Cheema was miles out. 222 is what Pakistan have managed, and I must say that it's a competitive score on this track. Aizaz Cheema run out (Finn/Kieswetter) 5(4) Broad to Umar Gul, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Cheema is run out off the last ball. The batsmen have taken 1 though.
PAKISTAN:49.5  Broad to Umar Gul, 2 runs, catch dropped! But a very tough chance for Morgan. Length ball on the off, Gul throws his bat at it and looks to go straight but mishits it, the ball goes very very very high and over point, Morgan runs back a long way and looks to take it but can't hold on..did well to cover the distance but could not finish the job
PAKISTAN:49.4  Broad to Aizaz Cheema, 3 runs, ha, this is good stuff from Cheema. He has given the strike back to Gul in the best possible manner, flicks this one off his pads, the fielder at mid wicket dives over the ball, the man at deep square has to cover a long distance and the batsmen complete 3 by then
PAKISTAN:49.3  Broad to Umar Gul, 1 run, well bowled and well played, low full toss on the stumps, Gul hits across the line and along the ground to deep mid wicket, just a single!Fine leg is inside the circle. 3 men in the deep on the leg side

PAKISTAN:48.6 Anderson to Umar Gul, FOUR, edged to third man for a four! There are crucial runs in the last few overs. Have to say Anderson was unlucky, he did well to maintain it in good channels around off, Gul pushed at it and got a thick edge which flew inches wide of a diving Kieswetter. Aizaz Cheema on strike for the next over though
PAKISTAN:48.5  Anderson to Aizaz Cheema, 1 run, Cheema does well to rotate strike, pushes this somehow past covers for a singleAizaz Cheema, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:48.4  Anderson to Ajmal, out Bowled!! You miss, I hit. Straight ball from Anderson, Ajmal slogs across the line and misses, it brushes the thigh pad and ricochets to the stumps.

PAKISTAN:48.3  Anderson to Umar Gul, 1 run, flat-batted awat to long off, short ball on the off, Gul stays in the crease and slaps it for a single
PAKISTAN:48.2  Anderson to Ajmal, 1 run, Ajmal escapes twice in 1 ball! Chips this straight ball to mid wicket, it goes tantalisingly close to Swann at mid wicket but falls short, Ajmal goes through with the single and would have been run out had Swann hit the stumps at the bowler's end
PAKISTAN:48.1  Anderson to Ajmal, 2 runs, in the air and safe! Short ball on the off, Ajmal looks to work it to the on side and gets a thick leading edge that stays in the air for a while but lobs over Morgan at backward point, gets a couple of important runsJames Anderson [9.0-0-43-1] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:47.6  Finn to Umar Gul, no run, brilliant ball to end a terrific spell. Completely beats Gul with this one, short of length and nipping away after pitching, Gul was squared up as he tried to work across the line and missed the ball completely, Finn: 10-1-24-3. What a spell, again!

PAKISTAN:47.3  Finn to Adnan Akmal, out Bowled!! Finn ends Adnan's struggle. And I don't think Pakistan will mind this, he was just not able to score today! Length ball on the middle stump, Adnan tried to make room and hit it over covers but missed it completely. 9 off 22 is not exactly what Pakistan wanted at this stage, but Finn has an opportunity to pick up another 4 wicket haul here.

PAKISTAN:47.2  Finn to Adnan Akmal, no run, another dot ball, Adnan is struggling. Jams this fuller one straight back to Finn
PAKISTAN:47.1  Finn to Adnan Akmal, no run, almost a run out! Gul would have been a goner had Broad hit direct. There was no run in this, Adnan defends it straight to mid wicket and Gul, for some reason, charges for the single, he had given up his attempt at recovery but Broad didn't hit direct

PAKISTAN:46.4  Samit Patel to Umar Gul, SIX, what a strike to bring up the 200! That is some hit.. Samit chooses the wrong option - he tries to give the ball some loop, Gul puts a foot forward and bangs it absolutely straight over the bowler's head, these are useful runs
PAKISTAN:46.3 Samit Patel to Adnan Akmal, 1 run, loopy on the off, Adnan Akmal takes a step forward and mishits a drive to long off, he wanted to go inside out but couldn't connect properly

Hafeez is on strike. Anderson will open the attackSo the umpires and players are out in the middle for the start of the match. The light is a little dim, due to the recent sandstorm. England will be bowling first for the first time in this series.Teams:England (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Kevin Pietersen, Jonathan Trott, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Craig Kieswetter(w), Samit Patel, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Graeme Swann, James AndersonPakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Farhat, Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Adnan Akmal(w), Shahid Afridi, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Gul, Aizaz CheemaCook: I would have liked to bat first. We hope to put pressure on Pakistan. We are going in with the same team. Everyone is performing well. We have fielded well and hopefully we can repeat the performance. Pietersen is capable and we have had good starts. It would be great to score three hundreds.Misbah: Younis Khan is ill and Asad Shafiq comes back. The keeper, Adnan Akmal, is back in place of Rehman. Shafiq is in good touch. This wicket spins and we need a regular keeper to handle Ajmal and Afridi. We have some plans for Cook. We have to be positive and put our 100%.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to batThere was a sandstorm early in the morning. However, the wind has died down and the light has improved.Steven Finn has been the man in form with the ball. He has picked up eight wickets in the first two matches. The English fielders have been very good and Pakistan have found the going very tough.Pitch Report: There is a little bit of green tinge on it. The pitch looks firm and it is hard. Nick Knight points out that there are some cracks on the good length area and that will aid the spinners. The pitch might get slower as the day goes on.Younis Khan is not playing for Pakistan today due to an illness. It is a big blow for them.However, after two ODIs, there is a complete change. England have managed to win the two ODIs in Abu Dhabi and are on the verge of a series win. Alastair Cook has been absolutely marvellous with the bat. His two back to back centuries have ensured that he held the England batting together. Bopara has also come back in form and together, they have tackled the spinners very well.Welcome to the 3rd ODI between Pakistan and England from Dubai. When the ODI series started, everybody expected that Pakistan would continue their domination. England have always struggled in the ODI format and on conditions that suited the Pakistani spinners, they were expected to be blown away.Preview by  Shashreek RoyThe series is at its mid point and England find themselves comfortably positioned with an unassailable 2-0 lead. Pakistan now know that it is impossible to win the series from here on, but at the same time they would also be well aware of the fact that any error from their end could see them losing it. Do or die is the message for the hosts now and they need to win the next two matches to try and level this four match series.PakistanMisbah-ul-Haq and his men have failed to match up to the quality displayed by their opponents twice now. Although the hosts did string together a better performance with the bat in the 2nd ODI, they still didn't have enough in the arsenal to take them across the finish line. With two games remaining in the series, Pakistan cannot afford to lose a single game from here and the 'Men in Green' have to find a way to counter the English onslaught.Pakistan did try and change things quite a bit in their second encounter against England and the changes did work to a certain extent. Azhar Ali provided more to the batting than Shoaib Malik courtesy a solid knock of 31, unfortunately though, he got out just went he was looking to go after the bowling. This time around, Ali will want to make more of the opportunity given to him at the number three slot otherwise the temptation to stereotype him as 'just a Test player' will resurface.Abdur Rehmann was quite impressive as far as the economy rate goes, giving way just 36 runs in his quota of ten. The only negative though, from him and the other spinners, was the fact that they weren't able to pick up too many wickets. In fact, Rehmann didn't pick up any wickets at all and unlike last time when the spinner ran riot, picking up seven wickets, this time they accounted for just two. The dearth of wickets allowed England to set a target that was beyond the Pakistanis and that should be a worrying factor for the hosts who have been dependent on their spinners until now.The batting has looked quite shaky throughout the ODI series so far. Not a single Pakistani batsman has scored a half century until now and apart from Misbah and Ali, who has played just the one innings so far, everyone averages below thirty. These problems have been compounded with Mohammad Hafeez's poor form at the top of the order and Younis Khan's struggle at number four. Pakistan will have to pull up their socks in the batting department if they wish to change their fortunes.EnglandEngland's path forward looks quite rosy and one without too many hurdles. They are 2-0 up and don't have to be fearful of a possibility of losing the series, simply because it isn't a possibility anymore. 'The Three Lions' can approach the rest of this series with a positive mindset and could even dream of whitewashing their opponents and returning the treatment that was dished out to them in the Test series.Alastair Cook has been leading from the front so far, courtesy back to back centuries. He has been able to wipe away the memories of the Test series and has played the spinners quite well in the two ODIs to accumulate 239 runs. Ravi Bopara has shown exactly why he should've played in some of those Tests as he has battled the spin with quite a positive approach and has looked to attack the tweakers rather than get bogged down by them.England's batting has looked better than their counterparts but only by that slight margin. Apart from Cook and Bopara, no one has really been very impressive with the willow. Eoin Morgan showed some good signs in the previous match but Kevin Pietersen's woes in the ODI format fail to come to a halt. Pietersen hasn't scored a century since the year 2008 and with the way he's batting now, it doesn't look like he is going to break that jinx very soon. England though, will want him to play a much better innings next time around and will also be eager for Jonathon Trott to bring back the consistency he showed last year. Trott in the series so far has scored just 23 runs.The bowling has been right on the mark from England, owing to a certain Steve Finn who has managed to pick up a four wicket haul in both games. Incidentally the man has also recorded identical bowling figures in the 1st and 2nd ODI. Samit Patel too has been amongst the wickets and to add to that, the English bowlers have been very disciplined in their approach. Not a single English bowler has recorded an average economy of over 5.13 taking both games into consideration. For an ODI those economy rates are a true testimony to the word miserly.Overall though, England have looked better in all facets of the game and will be looking to put together a similar, if not a better performance in the 3rd ODI. If the 'Queen's Men' record a victory in the match, then it would give them a good platform to try out some of the others in their squad.Final Word: England have looked far better in the ODI series than they did in the Tests but some of their batsmen are yet to perform with the willow. Pakistan will be under a lot of pressure to win both the matches from here and will know that they can get through England's batting order, if they get rid of Cook and Bopara early. All said and done the visitors will enter the contest as clear favourites and in all likelihood could carry the momentum forward and seal a third straight victory.
