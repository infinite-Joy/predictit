Panyangara will open the attackOpting to bat on a wicket that looked flat, Zimbabwe were off to a bad start when they lost Coventry and Taibu cheaply. The wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals and it seemed that Zimbabwe would be bowled out for under a 100. However, some good hits from Utseya, Price and Cremer helped Zimbabwe reach 162. Vettori, Mills and Southee were the stars with the ball and were well backed up in the field. New Zealand will be looking to negotiate the Zimbabwe spinners and get to the target comfortably.

Zimbabwe are a tough team. We have had some practice in the lead-up. It does affect us when we have a poor record in the sub-continent. Mills replaces How in the team.Chigumbura: It is a great wicket and we have to post a big score. If we put runs on the board, we will have a great chance. We are targetting every team that comes by. Sean Williams and Chris Mpofu are out and Panyangara and Chakabva come in.Zimbabwe have won the toss and elected to batHello and Welcome to the match between New Zealand and Zimbabwe at Ahmedabad. The Kiwis will be looking to regain some confidence after their walloping at the hands of the Aussies a few days ago. Their batsmen have struggled both against pace and spin in the sub-continent. They will be wanting to turn the tide against a Zimbabwe side who are a confident outfit. The spinners, Ray Price, Prosper Utseya and Graeme Cremer have done a great job for the Zimbabweans, while Taibu has been good with both bat and gloves. It promises to be a very interesting encounter at Motera. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.....Preview by Vishaal LoganathanThis may not be the David vs. Goliath encounter that we have come to see many times over the past few days. New Zealand have endured torrid form off late, being walloped by Bangladesh, India and then Pakistan while Zimbabwe troubles too have not been much less. The African side however, need not look farther than the Ireland-England game for inspiration after the minnows' stunning win against the English. Canada too produced a superb performance to trouble Pakistan. Is another upset on the cards?New ZealandAfter rather disastrous World Cup preparations, New Zealand got off to a flyer, skittling Kenya out for an embarrassing 69 before romping home in just 48 balls. Hamish Bennett was the undoubted star in that match with some hostile bowling. In their next encounter, an emotionally charged battle against Australia, they lost to the rivals. Nathan McCullum was one of the few players to have a good outing with the bat, top scoring with a fifty while the rest struggled to come to terms with the pace Brett Lee and Shaun Tait produced.
Their batting was woefully exposed against pace in that match, and Zimbabwe could do well to use that to their advantage. Their batting on recent occasions has depended heavily on the lower order or individual brilliance, but it would be the ideal opportunity for them to work as a team against Zimbabwe.
Their bowling delivered the goods in emphatic fashion against Kenya but could not repeat the performance against a red hot Australia. They have a good mix of pace and spin to trouble the top teams, but are very inconsistent. Talisman and captain Daniel Vettori has often been the lone fighter for New Zealand with consistent performances and New Zealand will want the others bowlers to contribute too.ZimbabweZimbabwe will come into the game with more confidence than the Black Caps after they thumped the Canadians in the previous match with Tatenda Taibu, Craig Ervine and Ray Price doing the bulk of the damage for the African side.
From the batting front, Zimbabwe seemed to have a settled line up with Brendon Taylor, Tatenda Taibu, Craig Ervine and captain Elton Chigumbura capable of taking the game away from the opposition. They will, however, have a much tougher task against NZ.
Ray Price, a bowler who has a run up that matches menacing fast bowlers at times, is Zimbabwe's most attacking option. The left armer bowls with great discipline and is at his threatening best when bowlers try to go after him. Zimbabwe will be reliant on the spinner to give them quick wickets as they aim to get their second win under their belts.Head to HeadNew Zealand and Zimbabwe have played each other 28 times before and the Kiwis have come out on top on 19 occasions and have been part of a tie once. Zimbabwe have won 7 times. One match was called off.QuotesRoss Taylor: As a batting unit we need to step up and score about 300-330 which is the par score in this tournament. We are all very talented. We are getting out there in the middle and just getting ourselves out. It's frustrating but we know we are not far away from that one good performance.
Ray Price : It is very important for us (the win against Canada). But you try not to think too much of that because in cricket if you think about the results then you forget about what you are supposed to do and control the areas you are supposed to bowl at.
