IRELAND:2.5 Steyn to Stirling, out Caught by de Kock!! It was a peach of a delivery. Actually, Stirling had started to walk, but stood his ground as umpire Martinesz didn't raise his finger. South Africa reviewed it immediately and got it in their favor. It was short of length and shaping away just outside off, Stirling has a feel for it away from the body, the outside edge carries at a good height to QdK. The Snicko showed a big spike and the decision was overruled. Stirling c de Kock b Steyn 9(6) [4s-2]Steyn to Stirling, THATS OUT!! Caught!!South Africa go up for a caught behind appeal and are reviewing it. Steyn is fine with his front foot, it is a legal delivery. Clear outside edge.

IRELAND:0.1 Steyn to Porterfield, no run, good length ball close to the off-stump, Porterfield watches it carfeully and lets it go through to the keeperPorterfield and Stirling are at the crease. Porterfield is on strike. Steyn will open the attackWelcome back.. Ireland have chased down targets of over 280 in their previous two matches. But, this is 400-plus and a more accomplished bowling attack. Can they get anywhere close to this target? We'll find out soon as Steyn steams in.Faf: "We did the basics really well again today and that's what we want to do as a top order. We want to lay the foundation for the guys at the end to have some fun. So, once again, really proud of the boys. It was nice (to bat), obviously hard work up front to get us into position and then when you do get into position, you try and have some fun as well. So nice to do it with Hash (Amla) today. It (pitch) looked a little bit better today and especially, we know as a batting unit we've got some really big power-hitters. Obviously Ireland, from a bowling point of view at the death, not very experienced. So we knew if we get into position to dominate, we could hurt them. Luckily today, it came off. It's great to bat with Hash (Amla), he's such an experienced guy, the best thing about him is the coversion rate. When he gets to 50, so many times he gets to 100. So for guys like myself, it's good to learn from that and then try and be half as good as that."For Ireland, Mooney started the proceedings on a good note. In his first 5 overs, he picked up a wicket and just gave away 9 runs. However, during the final stages of the innings, he was smashed all around and went for 43 off just 2 overs in his second spell. George Dockrell was the only bowler, who gave away less than 6 runs an over. Apart from him, the South Africans took a toll of the other bowlers, especially Sorensen and Kevin O'Brien. Sorensen gave away 76 in his 6 and O'Brien also conceded 95 runs in his 7 overs as well. It is going to be extremely difficult for Ireland to chase this down. But, we have seen funnier things happen in cricket. Join us in a short while to follow the run-chase.du Plessis was deceived by a yorker from Kevin O'Brien and de Villiers came out to bat after him. He started off in his usual manner, racing away to 22 off just 7 balls. However, Andy McBrine sent both Amla and de Villiers back in a space of 3 balls to halt the South African onslaught. After that Miller and Rossouw took the onus of going after the bowling. Both of them thrashed the Irish bowlers to all parts of the park and helped their team go past 400, becoming the first team to score 400 in consecutive games. Both of them finished unbeaten, with Rossouw bringing up his 3rd ODI fifty just before the end of the innings as South Africa recorded the second highest score in World Cup history. South Africa didn't get off to the best of starts, with de Kock failing one more time. Ever since he has come back from injury, he has struggled to get going with the bat. However, like the last game, Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis got together and steadied the ship from there on. Their rotation of strike was great and they made sure that the Irish couldn't bog them down, dispatching the loose ones to the fence. Both of them were together from the 3rd over till the 39th and put on 247 runs for the second wicket. In the process, Hashim Amla (108 innings) became the fastest man to reach 20 ODI hundreds, going past Virat Kohli. du Plessis also soon reached his ton and both of them then tried to accelerate.4
SOUTH AFRICA:49.6 K O'Brien to D Miller, FOUR, it's another edge past the stumps and O'Brien is a frustrated man.

SOUTH AFRICA:49.1 K O'Brien to D Miller, SIX, surely, 400 is a possibility now! Kev offers a juicy full ball, in the slot, Miller waits for it to come and slogs it very high over the mid-wicket boundaryKevin O'Brien [6.0-0-71-1] is back into the attack

South Africa plundered 400+ at the SCG against West Indies, can Ireland keep them down to a low total?Teams:Ireland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, Max Sorensen, George Dockrell, Andy McBrineSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Kyle Abbott, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to batAB de Villiers: Always we get those expectations to perform and I think all the teams at the World Cup, you want to represent your country in a good way and win games of cricket. It's another big opportunity for us to do well today. Hopefully, we will bring out our 'A' game. A couple (Duminy and Philander) are still struggling with niggles, but other than that, we are feeling mentally fresh, that's the most important thing. Really excited to play a good game. We are batting first, looks like a good pitch, just more of the same as we did in the last game, want to set a good foundation upfront, really assess good and communicate well, that's the fundamentals of a good batting innings. We dont't really have a preference, we just had a look at the wicket and had a good feel of the ground, played here not too long ago here against Australia and we feel batting first will suit our play for today the best. Same side this time around. He's (Duminy) not a 100% fit yet, he's batting in the nets, started bowling yesterday, just a little bit too late for us to push him in, don't want to risk him yet, will be probably ready for Auckland.William Porterfield: 'Yeah, it's obviously a nice feeling, but there's a long way to go. We have played only played 2 games, but we are happy with the way we have gone. It's good for the lads to come home the way they did (against UAE). We would have liked to have a bat on this, but we have chased pretty well so far, so long it may continue. Coming down at the back-end, he's (Kevin O'Brien) pretty key for us, struck a bit cleanly at the Gabba, so hopefully, he can continue that. One change, Andy McBrine comes in for Alex Cusack. We wanted an extra seamer at the Gabba and Andy has been performing pretty well for us, to get him back in here, hopefully he can continue with his form he had in the first game. We have come here with the ambition of getting into the quarter-final, we have done pretty well in the first two games, and we just got to take each game as it comes and this is the next challenge now, hopefully, can get two points from this.Pitch Report: 'This is a really good batting wicket. The surface is very dry, there's not much grass, and whatever little there is, it's well rolled in. South African pacers will get some bounce and pace off the surface. For Ireland, their best hope is to take the pace off the ball,' reckons Matthew Hayden.Stats: Dale Steyn will be playing his 100th ODI today. He becomes the 19th South African to achieve the milestone..Weather Report: It's a cloudy day at Canberra and is expected to remain so for the entire duration of the match. At 24 degrees and a humidity of 52%, players should feel comfortable in the middle. There's a light wind blowing across the ground and it should assist the new ball bowlers.Head-to-Head record: South Africa enjoy a 3-0 winning record over Ireland in ODIs. The last meeting was during the 2011 World Cup at the Eden Gardens and it turned out to be a hopelessly one-sided encounter.Pool Position: With 4 points in their kitty, both teams are very well placed in the points table. South Africa is ahead of Ireland on net run-rate although they have played one extra match.The Manuka Oval will be hosting its third and final encounter of the 2015 World Cup. The pitch tends to be on the slower side and the new-ball bowlers have generally enjoyed some swing and seam movement. With long boundaries, the bowler's have had a say as well, although Zimbabwe's bowlers would beg to differ.South Africa aren't taking the Irishmen lightly and is expected to play their full roster of seven batsmen. All-rounder, Farhaan Behardien, explains their plans here: "We want to bat deep and have AB batting in the back end of our innings. The idea of having seven batters is to let AB have the freedom to explode in the end".Ireland know the enormity of the task lying ahead but has refused to be bogged down at the prospect of bowling to AB de Villiers. "'AB (de Villiers) has been in great nick but you've just got to have your own simple plans and look after your own game. The thing is once the bowler lets that ball go, that's as much as he's in control of, and if he can execute whatever plans we've got in place as best he can, if something out of the ordinary happens at the other end, then so be it", skipper William Porterfield said.Here's what the two teams say about this crucial encounterIreland: After two comfortable wins over West Indies and UAE, Ireland are under no illusions as they begin the hard journey. On the positive side, most of the batsmen have found form but the bowling remains a question. Having conceded 275+ in their first two matches, it will be interesting to watch their approach against the free-stroking batsmen of South Africa.South Africa: It has been a roller-coaster ride for AB de Villiers and his men. Doubts were cast on the team after a below par show during their opening win against Zimbabwe and the humiliating 130-run loss to India only served to add fuel to the fire. The match against West Indies couldn't have come at a much better time for the beleaguered Proteas. Having broken several records during their recent ODI series against the same opposition, AB's men broke a few more on their way to a massive 257-run victory. It not only gave them a head start going into crucial fixtures ahead of the quarter-finals, it has also sounded warning bells for the rest of the teams.12:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: After a day's break, the World Cup returns with another huge Pool B encounter. Ireland, undefeated so far, lock horns with South Africa, one of the pre-tournament favourites at the Manuka Oval, Canberra. The race for the quarter-finals has well and truly begun and unlike Pool 'A', it's still pretty wide open in this pool. Before we go further, here's the analysis of the two teams.Preview:Skipper AB de Villiers' looming presence in a powerful South African side has not let Ireland forgo their positive countenance ahead of their Group B ICC Cricket World Cup match clash at the Manuka Oval on Tuesday. It was not bravado with which the Irish exclaimed that they would step on the pitch thinking of a win."If you get any Irish born team, they've got that belief when they come out on the pitch and they're going to scrap right to the last minute," skipper William Porterfield said on Monday. "I don't think we're any different. The mind-set has always been that if we're going out there 11 on 11, we're going out there to win. Tomorrow (Tuesday) is no different."Having beaten the West Indies while chasing over 300, Ireland held their nerves in a tight game against the United Arab Emirates and they are eyeing a quarter-final berth. They have done well to focus on raising their own game, especially their bowling at the death, rather than worry too much about the impending clash with one of the strongest units in the World Cup."AB (de Villiers) has been in great nick but you've just got to have your own simple plans and look after your own game. The thing is once the bowler lets that ball go, that's as much as he's in control of, and if he can execute whatever plans we've got in place as best he can, if something out of the ordinary happens at the other end, then so be it," Porterfield said.Yet, Ireland will need a combination of playing out of their skins and some poor cricket from South Africa to retain their slate clean on Tuesday. While the former can happen, it looks unlikely that the Proteas will let complacency come in the way, especially after a sluggish start to their campaign."We are not underestimating Ireland; we are not taking any opposition lightly," allrounder Farhaan Behardien, fronting for the Proteas at the media interaction said. "We are aware that they have won both games they played. We have done our homework on them but are focussed on one goal and are confident that we can win."South Africa had a near-perfect game against the West Indies, with each of de Villiers' moves clicking and the man himself scoring an unbeaten 162. They will use some of the first-hand information that they picked up at the Manuka Oval when they lost to Australia by 73 runs in November 2014.Skipper de Villiers' will recall that the Manuka Oval track is on the slower side quite like the MCG pitch that they lost to India two Sundays ago. He will be aware that his own bowlers may not find the kind of pace and bounce they relish while Ireland have the kind of bowlers who can pose some questions on such a pitch.It explains Behardien's extended response to a question. "We want to bat deep and have AB batting in the back end of our innings. The idea of having seven batters is to let AB have the freedom to explode in the end," he said. It does look like JP Duminy has not recovered from the sidestrain that sidelined him from the match against the West Indies.The one thing that could possibly have distracted the South Africans was the fire raging in Peck's Valley, south of Cape Town. Bowling spearhead Dale Steyn and the experienced Faf du Plessis are said to have farm houses there. Behardien said the team's strong support structure led him to believe that the fire in Cape Town would not singe the squad.Teams:South Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(k), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Kyle Abbott, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Jean-Paul Duminy, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Phangiso, Vernon PhilanderIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(k), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, Alex Cusack, George Dockrell, Max Sorensen, Andy McBrine, Peter Chase, Stuart Thompson, Craig YoungLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
