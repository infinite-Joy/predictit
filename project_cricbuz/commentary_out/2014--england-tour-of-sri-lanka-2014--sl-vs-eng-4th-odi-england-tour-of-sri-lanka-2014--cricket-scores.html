It should slow down as the games goes on. James Taylor replaces Alastair Cook. I provided some inputs into the team selection. We have picked up a team which we believe would win today.'Pitch Report: 'It is a dry pitch, should get slower as the day progresses. There will be something in it for the spinners. The team winning the toss should opt to bat first,' reckons Russel ArnoldBoth teams have one change.

With bright and sunny conditions, we expect a full 100-overs game.Hello and welcome to the 4th ODI between Sri Lanka and England. This match is being played at Colombo and with the series standing at 2-1 in favour of the home team, the match should be a cracker of a game. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.The home team started the series brilliantly. However, in the last ODI, their bowlers were taken to the cleaners by Moeen Ali, Joe Root and Jos Buttler. Mahela Jayawardene, who opted out of the last game citing personal reasons, is expected to come back into the side. His inclusion will provide the Lankan batting a big boost.In the last ODI, England batters responded brilliantly to pressure and provided them a much needed win. They chased down a total of 236 in 35 overs, after a rain delay of 3.5 hours shortened the ODI. England's captain Alastair Cook is out of this game as his team failed to bowl their overs in time. Eoin Morgan will lead the side in his absence.Teams:England (From): Moeen Ali, Alex Hales, James Taylor, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Chris Jordan, Chris Woakes, James Tredwell, Harry Gurney, Steven Finn, Ian BellSri Lanka (From): Kushal Janith Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Suranga Lakmal, Rangana Herath, Ajantha Mendis, Dilruwan Perera, Lakshan Rangika, Ashan Priyanjan, Lahiru Gamage, Dhammika PrasadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
