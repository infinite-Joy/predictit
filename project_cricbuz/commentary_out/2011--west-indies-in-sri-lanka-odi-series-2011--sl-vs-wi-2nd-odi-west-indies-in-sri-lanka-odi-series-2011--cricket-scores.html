There was continuous rain over the last 24 hours and the ground is covered.Hello and welcome to the 2nd ODI between Sri Lanka and West Indies. Conditions are overcast and there are high chances of rain playing spoilsport. The first ODI was abandoned, will we get a full game today? Stay tuned for the toss and team updates...Preview by Gokul GopalThe weather gods have not been kind to the Sri Lankan and the West Indian sides over the past couple of months and it was no different during the 1st match of the re-scheduled ODI series when the Caribbean side took on the hosts at Colombo. Although the West Indies did get to play a complete innings with Adrian Barath cracking his maiden ODI hundred, the bowlers were denied a chance to acclimatise themselves to the sub-continent conditions ahead of the World Cup. A downpour during the interval drenched the Sinhalese Sports Club and prevented Sri Lanka from coming out to bat.But in what was seen during the lone innings, the standout performance was of course Barath's hundred and what was also heartening for the Windies was Ramnaresh Sarwan's return to form. Sarwan added 168 runs for the third wicket with Barath during his solid knock of 75. West Indies would be hoping that he continues in the same vein during the remaining 2 ODIs as his form would be crucial for the Caribbean side during the World Cup.For Sri Lanka, Lasith Malinga's spell during the death was an encouraging sign. West Indies were all set to post a huge total, having piled on 206 runs in 43 overs. But Malinga picked up three quick wickets including that of Sarwan and Barath in the same over to restrict the tourists to 245/5 in their 50 overs. Malinga has all the capabilities to become the highest wicket-taker during the World Cup and Sri Lanka would be counting on him to deliver during the crucial stages.Weather:The second ODI is also shrouded under a rain threat and the conditions at Colombo do not look too encouraging. While both Sri Lanka and West Indies would be desperately hoping to get a game, the forecast does not look positive as scattered thunderstorms are predicted throughout the day.Quotes:"It is a good opportunity to put some of the plans in place that we are going to take into the World Cup. The players are fresh out of the Caribbean Twenty20 and are ready for what we have coming up": West Indies coach Gibson had said this before the start of the series. He would now be hoping that the Windies atleast get a chance to play one complete game.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Thilan Samaraweera, Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedera, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Muttiah Muralitharan, Dilhara Fernando, Ajantha Mendis, Thissara Perera, Chamara SilvaWest Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Adrian Barath, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Darren Sammy(c), Carlton Baugh(w), Nikita Miller, Kemar Roach, Sulieman Benn, Ravi Rampaul, Andre Russell, Devon SmithLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
