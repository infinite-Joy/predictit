Elias Sunny gets a ODI debutMisbah feels that the pitch is good for batting. It is important to post a good total on the board. Winning is a habit and we will look to continue.Pitch report: This is a different pitch today. The pitch has a yellowish tinge. There is a fair bit of grass on the surface. It should be a decent surface for batting. The ball might seam early for the pacers and 250-260 should be an ideal score, reckons Ranil AbeynaikeShakib:  We fought back very well in the 1st ODI. Our batting did not click, hopefully we will do well today and give our bowlers a chance. Pakistan are playing some good cricket at the moment. We are working hard at the nets and the results might come. To be honest, we are a bit down at the moment but we believe that we can comeback strongly. I will do my best for my team in all departments.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Farhat, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Shoaib Malik, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul, Saeed AjmalBangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Shahriar Nafees, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mahmudullah, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Elias SunnyPakistan have made one change. Sohail Tanvir is in for Aizaz Cheema. Two changes for the hosts. Elias Sunny and Imrul Kayes are in for Naeem Islam and Farhad Reza.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to batWelcome to the 2nd ODI between Bangladesh and Pakistan from Mirpur. Bangladesh's performance was very poor in the first ODI. The batting lacked application as they were bundled out for 91. Pakistan, on the other hand, recorded their 20th consecutive win against Bangladesh and they will be looking to seal the series today. Stay tuned for the toss which will take place at 12:30 PM IST.Preview by PradeepThey say winning is a nice feeling and that will be precisely what Pakistan will be feeling right now. After ambushing the hosts in the one-off T20, the visitors tore apart the fragile mindest of the Bangladesh batsmen in the 1st ODI. On a pitch that was aiding spin, the Pakistan spin quartet made hay as one batsmen after another struggled to come into grips with the pitch as well as the conditions. Batting was not easy, as the Pakistani batsmen found later on during the match, but the Bangladeshi batsmen were found wanting in technique and temperament. The 2nd ODI offers them one more opportunity to set right a few things.Pakistan: The scene for the second ODI remains the same and if the pitch offers the same kind of support as it did during the 1st match, things should be rather too easy for the Pakistan spinners. The statistics tell the story for the spinners. Shahid Afridi, Saeed Ajmal and Mohammed Hafeez find themselves amongst the top 10 wicket takers for the year. The trio have scalped a humongous 103 wickets between them this year. Add to this, the potency of their opening bowling combination, you have a attack that can bowl out the opposition cheaply.Unpredictable is the word for the Pakistan batsmen. Chasing a modest 92, they almost contrived to make a hash out of it. They were reduced to 63/5 at one stage and it needed some beefy blows from Afridi to take them home. Misbah-ul-Haq is a cool and composed man at the helm and he would not have liked the way some of the batters perished. If Pakistan are to take on the best in the business, they cannot afford any more sloppiness with the bat. Bangladesh: Mushfiqur bemoaned the fact that the pitch did not offer them any advantage at Mirpur. But it did not mask the inadequacies of his batsmen against any type of spin. Batsmen after batsmen failed to gauge the conditions and perished trying to be too cute. Bangladesh rely heavily on Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan and the over dependence on them have added to the pressure. As a captain of a team struggling to find its feet in international cricket, Rahim is entitled to his views but Bangladesh know that time is running out and a hostile home crowd would not appreciate a team falling like a pack of cards in almost each and every match.The bowlers have been left to do the thankless job of trying to conjure up miracles for the team. To be fair for them, they have been the only shining armor in what has been a pretty miserable time for the team. Rubel Hossain has bowled his heart out while the spinners have always been the go to weapon for the skipper. They have done pretty well and might have even won the 1st match if they had another 40-50 runs in the bank.Team news: Pakistan look a settled unit and may play the same XI that did the job clinically in the first match. Alok Kapali and Imrul Kayes are the back-up batting options for Bangladesh, but their stats are not that impressive enough to force an entry into the playing XI.Quotes: The problem for us is that we need to convert the starts into bigger knocks and we need to finish it - Misbah is not too impressed with the batting effort in the first ODI.I have not experienced what home advantage is in the last two series, to be honest with you - Mushfiqur laments that the pitches have not been helpful for his team.Final Word: Pakistan have had the wood as far as the previous meetings between these two teams go. They have a 26-1 advantage over their rivals and anything different other than another win cannot be imagined.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Mahmudullah, Abdur Razzak, Alok Kapali, Elias Sunny, Farhad Reza, Imrul Kayes, Naeem Islam, Nasir Hossain, Nazmul Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar NafeesPakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Aizaz Cheema, Asad Shafiq, Imran Farhat, Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Khalil, Saeed Ajmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Akmal, Umar Gul, Younis KhanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
