The square boundaries are shorter than the straighter ones. The pitch is very flat with the grass nicely rolled in.Brendon McCullum: We would have batted first too. It looks a good wicket to bat on. We should put a good score on and put pressure on South Africa. We should make sure we put ourselves in a position to be aggressive. Doug Bracewell and Nathan McCullum miss out. Andy McKay and Tarun Nethula come in.AB de Villiers: We're going to bowl first. We will try to restrict them to a decent total and chase it down. It is one of those wickets where it is tough to defend on. Justin Ontong comes in for Graeme Smith.South Africa have won the toss and elected to fieldBefore this series, there have been a total of five bilateral ODI series played between these two nations. South Africa have won four of them while New Zealand have registered victory only once. That one victory for the Kiwis came in 2004.Welcome to the 2nd ODI between New Zealand and South Africa from Napier. South Africa registered a convincing win in the first ODI thanks to a power packed century from their skipper AB de Villiers. For New Zealand, this is a must-win game for them if they have to stay alive in this series. Stay tuned for all the updates that take place.Preview by Siddharth PrabhakarBefore South Africa embarked on the tour of New Zealand, the general attitude in their camp seemed to indicate that they were treating their opponents as minnows. The work ethic of the Proteas has never been a subject of question, but the fact that their coach made certain inflammatory statements did not go down well with the Kiwis. The feisty bunch that they are, they gave a fitting response in the first T20 and though they lost the next two games, they made it clear that it would not be as easy as the Africans expected it to be. The first ODI might have been a one sided affair, but the Kiwis have a tendency to bounce back just when their backs are to the wall. This is exactly what will make the second ODI in Napier a very interesting game. South AfricaAB de Villiers will know that his side has not performed to it?s potential despite winning three games on the trot (2 T20s and the first ODI). Historically speaking, the South Africans have always set the benchmark as far as fielding is concerned. But the standards haven?t been that high so far. Considering the fact that ABD used to have an electric presence in the ring, he will expect his side to pull up their socks. As far as the bowling is concerned, the pace heavy attack has hunted in a pack while Peterson, the lone specialist spinner, did a good job of keeping things tight in the middle overs in the first ODI. The fact that Albie Morkel, a proven all-rounder, did not bowl even a single delivery in that match shows the depth that South Africa have in their bowling line-up. The batting seems to be too heavily dependent on the skipper and he would want his openers Amla and Smith to fire. If they can put up a good show in the second match, Kirsten?s side will take at least two trophies home. New ZealandWhen Brendon McCullum expressed satisfaction after the win in the first T20, he would have hoped that his side could put up a fight against the mighty South Africans in the remaining games as well. Though they should have won the final T20, the skipper would have been happier if the score line showed that. In this 3 match ODI series, they are already 1-0 down, but what will worry them is the ease with which their opponents got the better of them. The South Africans have a very experienced pace attack which has demolished batting orders much accomplished than the current Kiwi one and the hosts will need to show more than just grit to come up trumps against them. While the batting has clicked throughout the summer, the bowling has been a bit of a worry. Apart from the talismanic Kyle Mills, none of the bowlers have looked like getting the batsmen out. To make matters worse, Doug Bracewell, who had an excellent debut against Australia, has been given a rest in preparation of the Test series while Jesse Ryder is still nursing a calf injury. The onus will be on Tim Southee to shoulder a bit more responsibility.
