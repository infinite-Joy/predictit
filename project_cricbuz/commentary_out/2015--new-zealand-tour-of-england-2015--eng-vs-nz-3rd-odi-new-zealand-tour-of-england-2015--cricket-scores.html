Finn will open the attackThis is this first time England have gone past 300 in three consecutive matches. With some swing available on this pitch, it will be interesting to see how the inexperienced English attack goes against the likes of McCullum, Williamson and Taylor. Join us in a short while to follow the run-chase.Billings though played a handy cameo and both Stokes and him took the attack to New Zealand, hitting boundaries at will. He was dismissed after a 16-ball 34 and his downfall opened the floodgates for New Zealand. Soon England were bowled out for 302. For New Zealand, both their opening bowlers, Southee and the debutant Wheeler, picked up three wickets each. They were well supported by Henry, who chipped away with the wickets of Rashid and Willey towards the end. McClenaghan though was very disappointing once again as he turned out to be the most expensive Kiwi bowler, giving away 67 runs in just 8 overs.Morgan though continued to play well and along with Stokes, he played some delightful strokes to push the English run-rate even further. He reached yet another fifty, his third consecutive fifty of this series. He put on a 55-run stand with Stokes, before Williamson got one to rattle into his stumps. Buttler then came out and hit two boundaries before edging one wide ball off Southee.From 288/5, England lost their last 5 wickets for a paltry 14 runs to be bowled out for 302. New Zealand will be extremely happy with how well they pulled things back towards the end. England, however, didn't get off to the best of starts, losing both the openers when the team score was 34. Root and Morgan though played solidly as they stitched together a 105-run partnership for the third wicket. Just when Root was looking good to get another big one, he got out after going past his fifty.4

We are bowling with four seamers today. There is a good cloud cover and it's a 10:30 start, we should enjoy bowling here. Unfortunately, Trent Boult is out. You can't do much about injuries, he has been really good for us but now it's about the other guy coming in and trying to do well. Ben Wheeler and Matt Henry come in for Boult and Nathan McCullum. It's tough for the bowlers these days. Hopefully, it will swing around a little bit. If it does, we can be a little more attacking than we have been in the last two games.'Morgan: 'We are going to bat. It looks a really good wicket so we want to bat. With the cloud cover, we thought about bowling first but batting is our strongest suit and that's why we want to bat. Jordan and Plunkett are out, David Willey and Mark Wood come in. Looking forward to seeing how these new guys play.'England have won the toss and have opted to batWith the tracks offering very little assistance to the bowlers, the batsmen are having a ball in these games. The pitch that will be used today looks like another flat surface and we might get to see another run feast today. Chris Jordan has been ruled out for the remainder of the series with a side strain and England have named uncapped all-rounder from Somerset, Craig Overton, in the squad. Liam Plunkett too is out of this game. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.Hello and a warm welcome to the third ODI between England and New Zealand being played at the Ageas Bowl, Southampton. If last match was any indication of the firepower in both the teams, today's game promises to be another cracking affair. England might have fallen short by 13 runs in the last game, but they managed to put up their biggest total in a run-chase.England though were very happy with the way they approached the huge target. As Eoin Morgan pointed out during the post-match presentation, 'It was epic. These are the games of cricket we want to play. The style of cricket we played today was exceptional.' Morgan is thrilled to lead this New English side, a side that is trying to be aggressive from the outset. 'When the guys are willing to take 398 on, it is very exciting for us as a team,' he added.After scoring a mammoth 398 in the second game, New Zealand would have thought that they have made enough runs to level the series. Yes, they emerged out as winners, but only just. Even Brendon McCullum was surprised by England's approach towards the big target as they nearly chased it down. However, a rain intervention towards the end of the game saw Duckworth-Lewis being used and with it, all hopes of an English win were quashed.Preview:Journalist Simon Wilde described England's resurgence in three words - Prehistoric to historic. In three days, the home side has undergone a transformation that has been completely surprising. After thrashing New Zealand by a record margin of 210 runs in the first ODI, the hosts regrouped to deliver another near-perfect performance at the Oval. Unfortunately for themrain had the last laugh and New Zealand levelled the series with a 13-run victory.Both ODIs so far have been high-scoring encounters. More than 1000 runs have already been scored in the series and if these two matches are anything to go by, the Rose Bowl might see another run-fest. The good news for England is that their batting unit is in terrific form. While Joe Root and Jos Buttler were the heroes of the first match, Alex Hales, Eoin Morgan and a splendid eighth wicket stand between Liam Plunkett and Adil Rashid kept England afloat in the second. The unlikely pair had almost brought England on the doorstep of what could have been the second highest successful run-chase. However, rain broke their concentration and a revised D/L equation proved too tough for the tail-enders to overcome.New Zealand, on the other hand, responded brilliantly after their embarrassing defeat. Opting to bat first, they put up an intimidating 398 on the back of a majestic unbeaten ton from Ross Taylor. Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum gave them a dream start and the dependable Kane Williamson scored a gritty 93 before Taylor broke loose towards the end. They might have slipped up in the first ODI but in the second they showed exactly why they ended up as World Cup finalists just four months ago.This series so far has been a perfect example of the imbalance between bat and ball, and bowlers have suffered throughout. England were saved in the first ODI by their enormous total but in reality, except Trent Boult, most of them have ended up conceding too many runs. Boult has already picked up six wickets in two games and is the only bowler to have an economy rate under six. England's new attacking approach has ensured that both teams are evenly matched and the remaining ODIs are likely to offer cracking contests.Start Date: 14th June 2015Venue: The Rose Bowl, SouthamptonStart time: 15:00 IST, 09:30 GMTWeather: Cloudy with a maximum of 20 degree Celsius, couple of showers expected laterTeam News:England:Chris Jordan, who is suffering from a side strain is likely to sit out.

New Zealand have not yet named a replacement for him. The uncapped Ben Wheeler might get a game if New Zealand decide to rest Mitchell McClenaghan, who has been expensive so far.Probable XI: Brendon McCullum (c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliot, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi (wk), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent BoultTrivia:The last time New Zealand played at the Rose Bowl was in 2013 when they posted a mammoth 359, thanks to Martin Guptill's unbeaten 189.
