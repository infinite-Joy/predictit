AUSTRALIA:0.1  Brett Lee to Mahela Jayawardene, wide, starts off with a delivery down the leg side, wide called.Mahela Jayawardene and Dilshan are at the crease. Mahela Jayawardene is on strike. Brett Lee will open the attackWelcome back. The players are back onto the field. Sri Lanka have a stiff chase on their hands. Stay tuned to find out if they overhaul it or not.That ends the 1st innings and Warner has played a stunning knock to take Australia to a score of 321. He played from ball one until the final delivery and he looked determined to make a difference today. Sri Lanka looked clueless at the beginning when Wade and Warner were batting. Their body language was quite poor and it didn't look as though they were fired up for this encounter. Australia on the other hand wanted to set the tone from ball one and batted aggressively throughout the innings. The spinners were effective for Sri Lanka though as they pegged the hosts back a little. Dilshan was extremely economical and gave away just 35 runs in 9 overs. It makes you wonder why he wasn't given a 10th. Anyway Sri Lanka have an uphill task now as they attempt to make the highest ever successful run chase at the Gabba. Do join us shortly for the 2nd innings of the match.4

We hope to restrict them to a moderate total. We have to start all over again and get the basics right. Maharoof is back in the squad. Mathews has not recovered from his injury. Dhammika Prasad and Upul Tharanga are in the team today.Michael Clarke: There will be some swing throughout the day due to the overcast conditions. Peter Forrest is not in the team today and Clint McKay misses out. Lee comes back. Warner and Wade are a solid opening combination. Watson will be at No.3 and I will be at No.4. We have to be at our best today.Australia have won the toss and elected to batAustralia have won the last five games that have been played in Brisbane.Pitch Report: There is a hint of grass on this wicket. The sun is out and it is a hard pitch. Wasim Akram reckons that the team winning the toss should bat first. There will be some help for the pace bowlers.Another stat snippet: Since the 2006 season of the CB series, Australia have lost the first final in this competition. In the 2006 series, they lost the first final to Sri Lanka but bounced back to win the remaining to. In 2007 and in 2008, they lost the first finals to England and India respectively and they lost the competition on both occasions.Interesting Stat: Sri Lanka have never beaten Australia in an ODI at Brisbane.Australia will be smarting after they lost three out of the four league matches to Sri Lanka. However, they are back to full strength with the return of Michael Clarke. Australia will look to start off on a winning note today at their fortress.Welcome to the first final of the CB series between Australia and Sri Lanka from Brisbane. Sri Lanka have gotten the better of Australia for most of this series and they will look to continue their good form. However, they are plagued by injuries. Thissara Perera has flown home due to injury. Mathews and Maharoof were unavailable in the previous match and the Lankans will be hoping that both of them are back to full fitness today.Preview by Vishaal LoganathanBeating Australia in 3 out of 3 games in their own backyard is no small feat, but the Sri Lankans have done it with aplomb and look favourites to consign Australia to their fourth consecutive defeat against the Island nation. Australia on the other hand, have some work to do if they are to stop the resurgent Sri Lankan team running away with the trophy.Australia:Australia's main concern has been their inability to maintain momentum over a passage of time. Their other concern will be their form against the Lankans - they have lost 3 off the last 4 games played against the Island nation.Australia's batting troubles have been at the top of the order, David Warner and Matthew Wade have not been at their best recently, putting the rest of the batting order under pressure to perform. Australia's batting mainstay has been David Hussey. The younger Hussey has been a rock in the middle order for the hosts and along with the likes of Peter Forrest, Michael Hussey and Dan Christian done the bulk of the scoring. With Michael Clarke returning the the team and Shane Watson also showing form Australia will be silently confident about the options they have with the bat.James Pattinson looks set to retain his place after a good outing in the last game while Xavier Doherty too picks himself as the lone specialist spinner. Brett lee could make a comeback, though the selectors will give it a long thought as the pacer is suffering from a broken foot.Sri Lanka:Barring the first 2 games, Sri Lanka have been the most consistent side in the CB series so far. It was only a blistering Virat Kohli knock in Hobart that saw their passage to the finals become a lot harder. The Lankans will be pleased that the wake-up call came in the league stage and that gave them an opportunity to raise their game and maintain the upper-hand over the hosts in this series.Sri Lanka's batting, for far too long has been about Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara or Tilakaratne Dilshan, but this series has seen youngster Dinesh Chandimal take over as the main batsmen. The right-hander has been in brilliant form and was key to Sri Lanka as they turned around a horrible start in the series. The move to promote Jayawardene too has worked for the Islanders but they will miss the big-hitting prowess of Thissara Perera in the lower middle order.Lasith Malinga's brilliant performance in the last game, one for which I personally thought he deserved the Man of the Match award over Dinesh Chandimal, will have put a big smile on the Sri Lankan fans' faces. The right-armer is key to the Lankans both at the start and at the end and him being in form will be vital to SL's fortunes in the finals. The injuries to Farvez Maharoof and Perera will leave Sri Lanka short of balance and they will hope the likes of Dilshan and Lahiru Thirimanne chip in with some tight overs.Trivia:Australia have faced Sri Lanka three times in ODIs at the Gabba. They lost the toss on all three occasions but went on to win all three games. For Sri Lanka, their skipper, Mahela Jayawardene, has got fifties in two of the three games.Final Word:On form, Sri Lanka look the more likely to come out of the game victors, though one can never count out Australia. Sri Lanka will be missing a key all-rounder while Australia welcome back their regular skipper which could swing things in their favour.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Kulasekara, Farveez Maharoof, Lasith Malinga, Dhammika Prasad, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Sachithra Senanayake, Lahiru Thirimanne, Chanaka Welegedara, Chamara Kapugedera, Upul TharangaAustralia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Daniel Christian, Xavier Doherty, Peter Forrest, David Hussey, Michael Hussey, Brett Lee, Clint McKay, Matthew Wade(w), David Warner, Ben Hilfenhaus, Shane Watson, James PattinsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
