Good length ball close to off, the ball just held up on the wicket, Chandimal comes forward and checks his drive, the ball goes straight to Raina at short cover, who had been moved there from slip. Chandimal c Raina b Binny 9(13) [4s-2]Binny to Chandimal, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Short of length delivery angled across the left-hander, Perera goes for the pull, gets it off the splice of the bat and skies it towards mid-on, where debutant Karn takes it easily.

Rayudu failed for the first time in the series, but Virat came in and became the able ally for Rohit. The pair added 202 runs for the 3rd wicket before Kohli was run-out. Uthappa played second fiddle to the on song Rohit and he too added a 100-plus stand with the opener. The less we say about Sri Lanka's bowling and fielding, the better. They simply seemed out of sorts with both ball and in the field. A herculean task lies ahead of them. Hopefully, they turn up with the bat at least and put up a much better performance. Join us in a short while for the run-chase...Rohit: "No, not really. I am coming from a 2 months break (when enquired if he was tired). I was ready to bat another 50 overs. Once I got to 50, I knew I had to come good. It was a good batting wicket. We know even 350 is chaseable under lights here. I converted 100 into 150 and 200, then 250. It is important to look at the team score, you need to know how the team stands. It is really important to think while batting. That's what I did. I made my Ranji Trophy debut here. I got a hundred on my Test debut here, I scored an Indian IPL hundred here as well."What a comeback by Rohit! He has been given a guard of honour by his team-mates. I have just run out of the superlatives to describe the innings, but will try to do my best. He started off in a scratchy manner. He was put down on 4 by Thisara (Perera), but once he got through the initial stages, he started middling the ball. In fact, he was 6(20) at one stage. The boundaries started to flow and he kept toying with the bowling. His first 50 took 72 balls, the next 214 runs came off 101 balls. The boundaries seemed very short for him and the bowling looked ordinary when he got going. He went past plenty of milestones, none more significant than scoring his second double hundred.4
INDIA:49.6 N Kulasekara to Rohit, out Caught by M Jayawardene!! Heartbreak! He falls 4 short of the highest individual score in List A. However, it has been a magnificent, splendid innings from Rohit. It was an attempted yorker, Rohit charges down and converts it into a full toss, he does not quite get hold of it, hits it straight down the throat of long-off, where MJ collects it calmly. Rohit c M Jayawardene b N Kulasekara 264(173) [4s-33 6s-9]N Kulasekara to Rohit, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Can Rohit get the highest individual score in the 50-over format?

INDIA:47.6 N Kulasekara to Rohit, SIX, wow! This is just unbelievable batting from Rohit. This shot in particular was simply brilliant. The field was set for a off-side field, Kula bowls to it as well, full and too far across off, Rohit walks across his stumps, fetches it from there and lifts it over mid-on. That too would have been a wide had he let it go.
INDIA:47.5 N Kulasekara to Rohit, FOUR, superb! Where do you bowl to this man? Kula goes for the wide yorker, Rohit bends down, opens the bat face at the last instant, steers it fine to the third man fence
INDIA:47.4 N Kulasekara to Rohit, FOUR, Mathews seems perplexed with this assault. He does not know where to set the field for Rohit. Low full toss just outside off, he gets underneath it and lofts it over mid-off, the fielder was inside the ring and the ball bounces only once before reaching the fence
INDIA:47.3 N Kulasekara to Uthappa, 1 run, wide yorker outside off, Uthappa opens the face of the bat and guides it to backward point, Rohit calls him for a sharp run

INDIA:45.4 N Kulasekara to Rohit, FOUR, Sri Lanka's horrid day in the field continues. First, Kula bowls a waist high full toss, second Prasanna drops the catch at deep mid-wicket. Rohit was suprised with the delivery, but still managed to heave it away, Prasanna settled under it, pointed his finger upwards and spills it. Whats more the ball rolled into the fenceHighest score in ODIs: Virender Sehwag 219, Rohit Sharma 209, Rohit Sharma 201* (today), Sachin Tendulkar 200*, Charles Coventry 194*, Saeed Anwar 194, Martin Guptil 189*, Vivian Richards 189*, Sanath Jayasuriya 189, Gary Kirsten 188*.
INDIA:45.3 N Kulasekara to Rohit, FOUR, Rohit becomes the first man in the history of the game to register two double hundreds in ODIs. He has his hands aloft and takes his helmet off. Hugs Uthappa and acknowledges the packed crowd as well as his team-mates. He once again points his bat towards the sky. Coming back to the shot, it was a full delivery outside off, Rohit clears his front leg out of the way and drills the drive wide of long-off, the lightning fast outfield does the rest as the fielder can't get there in timeKula goes round the sticks
INDIA:45.2 N Kulasekara to Uthappa, 1 run, on a length just outside off, Uthappa opens the face of the bat and steers it to third man

Karn Sharma is making his ODI debut today.Both captains are cutting a cake to mark the celebrations of 150 years of the ground.Mathews: "I wasn't really sure about what to do. Whatever you do, you got to do really well. Ajantha, Dinesh, Lahiru and Eranga are playing. We've got to restrict them to a minimal score and try and chase it down."Kohli: "We are going to have a bat first. Looks like a good surface, the ball might do a bit under lights. Rohit, Karn and Binny are coming in for Dhawan, Ashwin and Ishant. We've got to encouter different situations. Everyone is in good mental space. It's a special ground for me personally, I scored my first international hundred here."India have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "I think we are in for a good game of cricket. There is a decent covering of grass, there are a few cracks but they aren't moving. This pitch will be good for the batsmen. If they bat well, we are in for a run feast again," reckon Sunil Gavaskar and Michael Holding.Both sides have been revamped for the remainder of the series. Rohit Sharma, Robin Uthappa, Karn Sharma, Kedar Jadhav and Vinay Kumar have replaced Shikhar Dhawan, Wriddhiman Saha, Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra, Ishant Sharma and Murali Vijay. Sri Lanka too have made quite a few changes. Kumar Sangakkara, Upul Tharanga, Suraj Randiv and Dhammika Prasad make way for Lahiru Thirmanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Ajantha Mendis and Shaminda Eranga. For India, it is likely that Rohit and Uthappa will take the field today. It would be interesting to see the playing XIs of both the sides. More about the toss and teams in a short while. Stay tuned...Sri Lanka on the other hand have been playing some below-par cricket in the series. Skipper Angelo Mathews has said that it is embarrassing to see the way his side is performing against a quality outfit like India. Tillakaratne Dilshan, though he got a fifty in the previous game, isn't looking in the best of touches. Mahela Jayawardene is the only batsman in the current squad, who's been flowing freely. The bowling has looked out of sorts and with the England series, in Sri Lanka, just a few days away they would like to end the series on a high and take some momentum back home with them.Hello and a warm welcome to game four of this 5-match ODI series. India have already sealed their 8th bilateral series win at home against Sri Lanka with comprehensive wins in the first three matches. However, captain Virat Kohli has made it clear that his side is not looking at the margin of victory in the series. Instead, he wants his side to take every game as a knockout game so as to get into the frame of mind to prepare for the all important World Cup.Preview by Gokul GopalHaving already clinched the series in a comfortable fashion, the Virat Kohli-led Indian team will be looking to take a 4-0 lead when they take on the low-on-confidence Sri Lankan team in the penultimate match of the series at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. The tourists, who have been way below-par in this series, will be looking to come up with a better showing in hopes of salvaging one or two consolation victories.IndiaDespite some of the key players being rested, the Indian team under Kohli has done a terrific job in keeping the Lankan team under the mat throughout the series. The Indian top-order has been in superb form, especially Shikhar Dhawan, who has registered scores of 113, 79 and 91. Ajinkya Rahane also hit a fine ton in the first game while Suresh Raina helped himself to a half-century in the same match. It was Ambati Rayudu's turn to hog the limelight in the second match as he scored his maiden ODI century. In the third game, Kohli registered his first fifty of the series while surpassing Viv Richards as the fastest to 6000 ODI runs. With the Sri Lankan attack unable to make any impact, the Indian batsmen are unlikely to have any problems in the remaining games as well, unless the tourists do something special.The bowlers have complemented the Indian batsmen well by coming up with disciplined performances in all the games. Ishant Sharma's four-wicket haul was instrumental in bowling out Sri Lanka cheaply in the first match. Axar Patel has made good use of the opportunity provided to him by doing well in all the games, while R Ashwin too has kept things tight at his end. Umesh Yadav, who has shown a lot of control to go with his pace, picked up a four-wicket haul in the third match and is the top wicket-taker in the series so far, followed by Axar. It has been a fine all-round performance by India so far and the hosts will be looking to continue in the same vein and consolidate their No. 1 position in the ICC rankings.Sri LankaInconsistency has been Sri Lanka's main bane in the series with the seniors feeling most of the pressure as the youngsters have not been able to do much. Tillakaratne Dilshan got off to promising starts in all the games, but he could only muster one fifty plus score, which came in the previous game. None of the Lankan batters came to the party in the first match while Angelo Mathews and Kumar Sangakkara did well in the second game, but it was not enough as the rest of the batsmen failed. In the third game, Sri Lanka would have been bowled out for a total much less than what they eventually reached (242), and it was only possible because Mahela Jayawardene hit a fighting ton. Sri Lankan batsmen have not been able to fire collectively and this has given coach Marvan Atapattu and skipper Mathews lots of headaches.Be it quick bowlers or spinners, none of them have been able to contain the Indian batsmen. Lahiru Gamage, Dhammika Prasad, Thisara Perera, Mathews and Nuwan Kulasekara were the different seam options used by Sri Lanka in the earlier games, but not one of them has made an impact. The spinners have not done much either with Suraj Randiv and Seekkuge Prasanna going for a lot of runs. Sri Lanka have brought in some fresh legs for the final two matches, but how much will it aid them in reversing the fortunes of the side, remains to be seen.Team NewsShikhar Dhawan has been rested for the last two ODIs while India also decided to give Wriddhiman Saha, Ishant Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja a break. A total of 6 players, which also includes Amit Mishra and Murali Vijay, were removed from the 15-man squad. Vinay Kumar, Robin Uthappa, Rohit Sharma, Karn Sharma and Kedar Jadhav were the ones to be included. Amongst these, Rohit and Uthappa look like certainties to fit into the Indian XI for the remaining matches as replacements for Dhawan and Saha. For Ishant's spot, Vinay and Stuart Binny are a couple of options while India may also look at including an extra spinner.Sri Lanka made four changes to their squad, leaving out Kumar Sangakkara, Dhammika Prasad, Upul Tharanga and Suraj Randiv, while bringing in Shaminda Eranga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal and Ajantha Mendis. Amongst the ones to be left out, Sangakkara and Prasad were the only players rested, according to team manager, Michael de Zoysa. There is a possibility that all four new inclusions will feature in the upcoming game.Pitch and ConditionsThe 4th ODI will be played at the Mecca of Indian cricket, Eden Gardens, which is celebrating its 150th year in cricket. The pitch at this iconic venue has generally helped the spinners and the trend is likely to continue. The captain winning the toss is likely to chase as the dew factor might come in to play, making it difficult for the bowlers in the second innings.Numbers5: The number of centuries Virat Kohli has scored against Sri Lanka in ODIs. He needs one more to join Gautam Gambhir at the second spot for Indians with most tons against Sri Lanka. Sachin Tendulkar occupies the top spot with 8 centuries.18: The number of matches India have played at the Eden Gardens. They have won 10 and lost 7 while one game yielded no result.QuotesI am focusing on every single game. Taking each game at a time because I know that a good performance in each game will take me that much closer to securing a World Cup berth: Umesh Yadav.We have to be ruthless ourselves. We need to step up and play for our pride. We have fresh guys coming in.
