ENGLAND:3.6 Dead ball 3.6 Dead ball. a) If following a Player Review request, an original decision of Out is changed to Not Out, then the ball is still deemed to have become dead when the original decision was made. The batting side, while benefiting from the reversal of the dismissal, will not benefit from any runs that may subsequently have accrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally made a Not Out decision, other than any No Balls penalty.Bailey: "Good night out there, very very happy. It was a very special moment, the anthems were fantastic. You like to see when the top stands start filling up at the MCG, it was a pretty entertaining game of cricket. We were happy to bat first, big game and we were obviously a little bit anxious. I think there's been a big build-up and just that anticipation of a big tournament starting... We felt like we've got a really strong batting line-up and it was nice to make first use of the wicket with the bat. It's his (Finch) home ground and he rose to the occasion. That's what we want from our top-order, to play some match-winning innings and he certainly played one tonight. I don't think he (Mitchell Marsh) has bowled that many overs in a row for a while. I wanted him to get five wickets, but I didn't know for how many overs he was good enough and the medical staff would be yelling at me as to what's happening (smiles). But, he was outstanding and really broke the game open for us. Good partnership, wasn't it (referring to his 146-run stand with Finch). We lost a couple of wickets and it was nice to set up the innings for the likes of Maxi and Mitch to come out and go crazy as they do."Morgan: "I think it (Australia's total) was above par on this wicket, it was a good surface. We probably let ourselves down in the field and our death bowling in particular probably let us down as well. 310 was a par score but we needed to come out all guns blazing to chase down 340. With Jimmy and Broady at the top, we thought we could make some early inroads. Finny taking his second fifer on this tour so far has been great, he has shown great promise. Obviously James Taylor has been batting well and he's very unlucky not to get the 100. Another tough game (against New Zealand) in the group stage and again if we keep testing ourselves against the best side and learn as much as we can as the tournament progresses, hopefully we'll hit the straps come the quarterfinal."Australia put up a slick performance to thump England by a margin of 111 runs and get their World Cup campaign off to a great start. Australia piled up 342 for 9 on the board before bundling out England for a modest score of 231. Aaron Finch turned out to be the star of the show for Australia as he composed a brilliant century. Among the bowlers, Mitchell Marsh took a five-wicket haul for the hosts. James Taylor played a lone hand for England, but just didn't get the support from the other batsmen.In fact, Australia made a nervous start to their innings with Chris Woakes dropping an easy catch off James Anderson's bowling as Finch got a reprieve. The drop catch proved costly, as Finch produced explosive fireworks to explore every nook and corner of the ground. For a brief period, Stuart Broad lifted the sagging morale of the England team by snaffling the wickets of David Warner and Shane Watson in quick succession. But Bailey, Australia's stand-in captain, came to the rescue and stitched an important partnership with Finch. Once Finch was dismissed for 135, Maxwell played with a dash of strength and bravery to take Australia to an imposing total. For the visitors, Steven Finn took a five-for, including a hat-trick at the end of Australia's innings.While chasing down a huge total of 343, England capitulated against some disciplined bowling and athletic fielding by Australia. Brad Haddin took a superb one-handed catch to dismiss England captain, Eoin Morgan. Steve Smith also plucked a catch out of thin air at short cover to send Jos Buttler back to the pavilion. The diminutive Taylor gave a good account of himself with a sparkling innings. It was an innings full of improvisation. Unfortunately for him, he was left stranded on 98, with James Anderson getting run out. Australia will face Bangladesh in their next game in Brisbane. On the other hand, England will have the daunting task of taking on one of the in-form sides of the tournament, New Zealand, in Wellington.Finch: "It's nice, it's a bit surreal. It's a great feeling to get a win first up. We would have batted first anyway and it's nice to get a game out of the way. Everyone contributed, with bat or ball. Great feeling to get a win tonight and hopefully we'll take a lot of momentum through the rest of the tournament."Aaron Finch is the Man of the Match for his 128
ENGLAND:41.5 Hazlewood to James Taylor, out J Anderson Run Out!! Phew! Inswinging yorker from Hazlewood, Taylor misses the flick and gets hit low on the pad. The impact was around the leg stump and umpire Dar ruled Taylor out immediately. Taylor then sent it upstairs and replays suggested that it was clearly missing the stumps. The LBW decision was reversed. However, as the batsmen tried to take a run, Maxwell fired a direct-hit at the striker's end from backward point and Anderson was just short of his crease. Taylor couldn't believe his luck and in the end, he took his helmet off and again shook hands with the Australians with a smile. J Anderson run out (Maxwell) 8(11) [4s-1]Hazlewood to James Taylor, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Drama! Taylor has been given out LBW, but he's reviewed it straightaway. He shakes hands with the Australian players with a smile. Umpire Aleem Dar raised his finger in a flash. No problems with Hazlewood's footing. No inside edge as well. Oh looks like it is going down the leg-side and yes it is. It is Not-Out! Umpire Dar changes his verdict. Big confusion out there. Maxwell fired a direct-hit and they have also asked the third umpire to check the run-out. Anderson is short of his crease, umpires converge and this time Dharmasena raises his finger to signal the end of the game. Some reckon it should be a dead-ball as the original appeal was for LBW. But the third umpire sends the word that Anderson is OUT and Taylor is stranded on 98. What a dramatic finish!
ENGLAND:41.4 Hazlewood to J Anderson, 1 run, in the air, but safe. Short delivery on the off stump, Anderson gets the shoulder of the bat, the ball goes in the air, point runs to his right, puts in the dive but the ball drops wide of him. Batsmen cross over
ENGLAND:41.3 Hazlewood to James Taylor, leg byes, 1 run, in the air, but safe. In fact the umpire signals a leg bye. It looked like a top edge. It was a slower delivery outside off stump, Taylor tries to pull, but looked like it went off the helmet to fine leg
ENGLAND:41.2 Hazlewood to James Taylor, no run, full and in the slot, he was looking to drive it in the gap but he's hit it straight to extra-cover

ENGLAND:40.4 Starc to J Anderson, no run, a solid forward defence from Anderson this time
ENGLAND:40.3 Starc to J Anderson, no run, gee! That was very close to the leg stump. Yorker swinging back in at pace, Anderson backs away and tries to squeeze it out, but misses. Haddin makes an excellent save diving to his right. In fact, Anderson got the toe-end of the bat on that occasion, but it went on the bounce to the keeper
ENGLAND:40.2 Starc to J Anderson, no run, got to move your feet, James Anderson. A lazy cut shot attempted but he only meets with thin air
ENGLAND:40.1 Starc to J Anderson, no run, good length delivery on the off stump, blocked
ENGLAND:39.6 Johnson to James Taylor, no run, oh the little man was initially trying to get across the line to pull, but Johnson delivered this bumper at 143kph and Taylor just about manages to get out of the line before letting it go to Haddin. He wears a smile on his face as he suggests to Johnson that it was a good ball
ENGLAND:39.5 Johnson to James Taylor, 2 runs, slower delivery outside off stump, Taylor slogs it over backward square leg. The ball took the inside half of the bat on that occasionJohnson has sent mid-off back.

ENGLAND:38.2 Starc to James Taylor, FOUR, that's cheeky from Taylor and he's got four for it. Short slower ball on the stumps, Taylor bends his knees and ramps it over Haddin's head for four more
ENGLAND:38.1 Starc to J Anderson, 1 run, a juicy, friendly full toss on the off stump, Anderson simply opts to tap it wide of mid-off, instead of going hard at it
ENGLAND:37.6 Johnson to James Taylor, FOUR, top shot sir! A classy shot indeed. Low full toss just outside off stump, Taylor shuffles in the crease and as he sees the low full toss come his way, just opens the face of the bat at the last moment and steers it past backward point. He timed it so sweetly that third man was a mere spectator
ENGLAND:37.5 Johnson to James Taylor, no run, Johnson takes pace off the ball this time, Taylor slogs and gets an inside edge onto pad
ENGLAND:37.4 Johnson to James Taylor, no run, ugly slog across the line, but you can't blame Taylor for it. He's running out of partners and he's trying to score as many as possible

ENGLAND:37.3 Johnson to J Anderson, 5 wides, oopsy! He's lost control of the ball and sprayed this way down the leg-side. Haddin couldn't get to the ball even with a full length dive to his right. Some consolation for England as the 200 comes up
ENGLAND:37.2 Johnson to J Anderson, no run, fullish and just outside off stump, Anderson gets behind the line and defendsJames Anderson, left handed bat, comes to the creaseTwo slips in place now.
ENGLAND:37.1 Johnson to Finn, out Caught&Bowled!! That's a dolly! Absolute dolly and Johnson runs forward to swallow the ball. Bouncer right at the body of the batsman, Finn had to play at it. He stays very stiff and tries to fend the ball, but it hits him high on the bat and pops up in the air for the simplest of catches. Australia are almost there now!

ENGLAND:36.2 Starc to Finn, no run, short delivery outside off stump, Finn lets it goSteven Finn, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ENGLAND:36.1 Starc to Broad, out Bowled!! Full and straight, you miss, I hit! It's a great sight for a fast bowler when he hits the base of the stumps. Starc has been good of late with his reverse-swinging yorkers and Broad had no clue to this one, which shaped back in very late. Broad hardly bothered to move his feet, in fact he backed away slightly as well, maybe that Mitchell Johnson toe-crusher in the Ashes is still playing on his mind. He never got in line with the ball and it crashed into middle and leg. Second wicket for Starc. Broad b Starc 0(1)Starc to Broad, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

ENGLAND:35.2 Johnson to Woakes, out Caught by S Smith!! Who wants it? Who wants it? That's a gift and Smith doesn't drop those. A clever slower ball from Johnson breaks Woakes' 92-run association with Taylor. Woakes was completely foxed by the lack of pace, he went way too early into the drive and scooped it straight up in the air, mid-off took a few steps back, settled under it and took it cleanly.

So it is just a matter of time for Australia now to wrap this game.

ENGLAND:15.1 M Marsh to James Taylor, no run, on a good length and on off and middle, Taylor was looking to defend it into the on-side, the ball goes towards the bowler off the outside half of the batDrinks are on the field now.Here is our man, Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first fifteen overs: After Australia piled up a massive total of 342 for 9 in 50 overs, England lost a slew of wickets to find themselves in dire straits at 67 for 4 after 15 overs. For England, only Ian Bell played some well-timed shots before he was dismissed for 36, superbly caught by Mitchell Starc in the deep. Once Bell got set, he was able to bisect the gaps with clockwork precision. The essence of Bell's precise metre of timing can be encapsulated by the way the right-hander used supple wrists to loft Mitchell Johnson over cover for a boundary, in the ninth over of the game.For the hosts, Mitchell Marsh snared the wickets of Bell, Gary Ballance and Joe Root, and at one point of time was on the verge of taking a hat-trick. On the other hand, Starc took the wicket of Moeen Ali. Australia bowled with good disciplines by hitting back of a length and were duly rewarded.

He went on to crack the first hundred of 2015 World Cup and Australia ended on a massive 342/9, their highest ODI score against England. Can the English batsmen show some fight?This target will take some chasing and it will be interesting to see England's approach with the bat. Take a break and be right back here for the second innings.Glenn Maxwell: 'That was very nice to get a couple out off the middle and I built on after an amazing start from the boys. I think 342 is going to be a very good total for us to defend. I think it (pitch) is going to crumble and dry up a little bit. I think it was pretty dry and slow when we were out there. Hopefully, we can take the pace off a little bit, I reckon it will be very hard to chase.'For a brief period, England made a comeback by taking a slew of wickets. In particular, Stuart Broad bowled with verve and purpose to snare two wickets in a single over. However, Finch and George Bailey consolidated Australia's innings with a century stand. Finch targeted straight boundaries and played shots square of the wicket on either side to keep the scoreboard moving. Once he was run out by a bullet-like direct-hit from Eoin Morgan, Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh with lethal blows, dismantled the English attack. Maxwell also notched up his fifty in a mere 30 balls. Steven Finn then signed off in style and bagged a hat-trick off the last three balls of the innings to finish with a fifer.After England won the toss and elected to bowl, Aaron Finch played a crunching innings of 135 to take the hosts to a monstrous score of 342 for 9 in their allotted 50 overs. George Bailey and Glenn Maxwell also played their part by compiling key knocks. For England, James Anderson started on a good note and should have taken the wicket of Finch, but Chris Woakes dropped an easy catch at short mid-wicket to give the opener a reprieve. The drop catch proved costly, as Finch flayed the English attack to all corners of the ground and composed his sixth ton in ODIs. He now holds the record for the highest individual score in any England versus Australia game in the history of World Cups.4
AUSTRALIA:49.6 Finn to Johnson, out Caught by J Anderson!! Finn gets the 37th hat-trick in ODI history. This is the first hat-trick by an Englishman in a World Cup.

He ends up hitting it straight to Anderson and Finn is extremely happy as his teammates celebrate the hat-trick. Johnson c J Anderson b Finn 0(1)Finn to Johnson, THATS OUT!!

Broad comes back and is welcomed with a round of boos from the MCG crowdHere is our man, Bharath Ramraj's analysis: Aaron Finch and George Bailey consolidated after Australia lost a slew of wickets to find themselves in a spot of bother at 70 for 3. Finch twinned good defence with power-packed shots to keep the scorecard ticking. James Anderson, by pulling his length back, bowled a few tight overs. Finch then, opened up his shoulders to thump Anderson for a six down the ground and also took a heavy toll on Moeen Ali's bowling. Finch notched up his 6th ODI hundred. He now holds the record for the highest individual score in any England versus Australia game in the history of World Cups. The track should stay true for the entire duration of the match. With Australia looking set to amass a mammoth total on the board, England's batsmen have an uphill task on their hands.Stuart Broad [7.0-0-42-2] is back into the attack

AUSTRALIA:15.1 Finn to Finch, 1 run, fuller length delivery and well outside off, Finch gets a big stride forward and drives it to the left of mid-off for a singleHere is our man, Bharath Ramraj's analysis of the first fifteen overs: In the second game of the 2015 World Cup between Australia and England, played in front of a jam-packed stadium at MCG, the visitors made a smart recovery after dropping a few catches early on in the innings. With nerves jangling, Aaron Finch, played the third ball of the innings straight to Chris Woakes at short mid-wicket, but was dropped. James Anderson was the unlucky bowler. After Taylor too dropped a tough chance at mid-off to give David Warner a reprieve, England lost the plot. Anderson, in an attempt to bowl the in-swinger, drifted onto the pads. Just in the nick of time though, Stuart Broad, Anderson's partner-in-crime, by bowling a fullish length and generating swing, snared the wickets of Warner and Shane Watson. Woakes, followed up the efforts of Broad by shattering the stumps of Steve Smith. Smith, who has been very successful this summer, paid the price for shuffling across the stumps. Intriguingly, that method has paid him rich dividends, in recent times.That is the first drinks break of the game. England dropped both Finch and Warner early and the duo then upped the ante to bring up their fifty partnership in quick time. However, Broad got them back into the game by removing Warner and Watson off successive balls. Woakes came on and knocked over Smith to push Australia on the back foot. This is a crucial partnership for the co-hosts and they would want these two to carry on further.

Full and outside off stump, Smith shuffles across and looks to drive but he leaves a big bat-pad gap, he was off balance while trying to meet the ball and hence he couldn't find the middle of the bat.

Two slips in place for Anderson.David Warner and Aaron Finch walk out to a loud cheer.Morgan leads his men out. There are many contests within this contest, but first-up, it's a mouthwatering face-off, it's James Anderson v David Warner.Right, a big day at the MCG, a capacity crowd is out there to watch this big match, featuring the hosts against England, their Ashes rivals. It's time for the national anthems.Teams:England (Playing XI): Moeen Ali, Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), James Taylor, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, James AndersonAustralia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Steven Smith, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh HazlewoodEngland have won the toss and have opted to fieldMorgan: "We will bowl first. We are all excited about this match, we are not going to hold things back. The pitch looks good, shouldn't change a lot. The pitch was under cover after heavy rain last night, so that should help our bowlers. We are playing an extra batter, Ballance replaces Bopara. We thought Bopara's bowling would come in handy, but it didn't turn that way during the practice matches. Hence, made the change."Bailey: "We were loooking to bat first, so happy with the toss. It's been a big build-up, expecting a big crowd and it's a big game to get going. It looks like a great wicket, it shouldn't change a lot, we would like to get a big score and put pressure on them. It's a huge game and we are all keyed up. We had some tough decisions to make regarding our team setup, hopefully it will stay the same during the remainder of the tournament as well. We have gone with Hazlewood, he has done well, both with the new ball as well as during the death overs. We need to be consistent over the entire duration of the game and hopefully that will be good enough."Pitch Report: "Well, the sun is out here in Melbourne, we had a few showers in the morning, but the covers are off and there might be a bit of sweating under the surface. Overall, I think this is going to be a really good cricket wicket. The average score batting first in the last 10 ODIs is 273. So it's a pretty decent batting track. It is rock hard, it is a nice even pitch, the cover of grass is really even. I think the new ball from both teams will really fly through," reckons Mark Waugh.On the other hand, England are pondering about playing an extra specialist batsman. In that case, Gary Ballance, who made 57 in England's final practice match against Pakistan might edge out Ravi Bopara, who has been struggling for form in recent times.Early team news: Australia are certain to miss two of their star players for this match. While Clarke is fit and is expected to start in Australia's next match. James Faulkner sustained a side strain during the final of the tri-series and has been ruled out of this match for sure. There's some news about him though. If he's not fit enough to bowl, he might play as a specialist batsman later on during the tournament.Captain's corner Australia's captain, George Bailey, is in a strange position. He will be leading his team at the MCG, but isn't sure of a place in the playing XI in the next match, against Bangladesh at the Gabba. He doesn't seem to be fussed about it though. This is what he said: "I think it's a pretty basic equation there. So what will be will be. I think it's great that he (Clarke) is on track. Certainly from the initial time of his injury, I think he's done a remarkable job to get back in time. To even have murmurs of him playing in this game, to be available for the next game, which was always the plan, I think he's done a great job."Despite their impressive recent form, England have found Australia a tough nut to crack. They played their Ashes opponents thrice in the tri-series and lost each match in convincing fashion. Skipper, Eoin Morgan, doesn't want to dwell into the past though as his side prepares for its first match of the World Cup. "We should not be striving for a formula that is not ours. The fact is that the majority of us have been in series where we have beaten Australia. We have not been worn down by them winning," he said.Head-to-headIt is advantage Australia when it comes to World Cup games between these two teams as they have won 4 out of their six meetings in the mega event. After Gary Gilmour blew England away in 1975, Mike Brearley's men bounced back four years later to make it 1-1. Although Mike Gatting's infamous reverse sweep then gave Allan Border's team the cup in 1987, Ian Botham helped England beat Australia in their own backyard in 1992, in what was a convincing victory at the SCG. Australia secured a sensational come-from-behind victory in 2003 and backed it up with an easy victory four years later at Antigua.EnglandOn the other hand, contrastingly, England have not had a good run leading up to the tournament as they managed to win just 11 out of their last 31 ODI games since 2014. However, after the sacking of Alastair Cook, the revamped side under Eoin Morgan has looked more positive and has shown good intensity. The appointment of Jos Buttler as vice-captain just ahead of the World Cup shows that the selectors rate him highly because of his work ethic and a good cricketing mind. Moeen Ali's contribution with both bat and ball adds another dimension to the side, which has benefited from the impressive return of both James Taylor and Steven Finn. While Taylor has had four 50+ scores since December 2014, Finn bagged 11 wickets in the recently concluded tri-series, including a fifer.However, the form of Morgan and Bopara with the bat is a bit of a worry for England as they have been blowing hot and cold. Ian Bell has silenced critics with a hundred and a fifty in the tri-series just a few days ago. Joe Root remains as one of the key batsmen in the middle-order, which is later supported by Buttler and Chris Woakes. Meanwhile, spearhead James Anderson has been amongst the wickets, while Stuart Broad has done decently well after his return from injury. Chris Woakes has mostly hit the right areas and has the wickets to show that he belongs to this level. In fact England outcast Kevin Pietersen rates this team highly and expects them to do well in the World Cup. Interestingly, Andrew Flintoff trained with the England team and put them through boxing drills, while also rolling his arms over at the nets.AustraliaHaving lost just one match out of their last 13 outings, which includes three successive series wins, the Men in Yellow have had a great time in the build-up to the tournament. Runs have flown freely from the bats of David Warner, Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell's return to form has come at the right time for the hosts as it strengthens their middle-order. While Mitchell Johnson remains a threat to opposition batsmen every time he takes the field, Mitchell Starc has swung the ball both ways of late and picked wickets at will. Josh Hazlewood has not just taken wickets, but has also proved that he can keep a tight lid on the scoring rate by bowling a disciplined line.It is quite unfortunate that they will miss their regular captain Michael Clarke as the team management decided not to rush him back from injury, despite Clarke scoring a promising fifty against UAE in Australia's second warm-up game. Instead, they have revealed that Clarke will play in Australia's second game against Bangladesh on February 21. However, the side, under stand-in captain George Bailey, has proved that Clarke's absence does not affect the team balance much as 10 out of their last 11 ODI wins have come without Clarke taking the field.So how have the teams fared recently and prepared for the big occasion? Let's take a close look.13:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: Hello there! New Zealand have already locked horns with Sri Lanka to kick off the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Christchurch. It's now time for co-hosts Australia to take on England at the picturesque Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) to inaugurate the Australia leg of the multi-nation event. The Ashes rivals have played competitive cricket almost every time they met each other and let's hope that we witness another edge-of-the-seat thriller at the "G" tonight. It was damp this morning because of the overnight rain, but the good news is that the weather has cleared up and things are looking promising.Preview by Gokul GopalFour-time champions Australia, playing their first World Cup game at home in 23 years, will be eager to start their campaign in style when they take on England in their opening game on 14th February, 2015. Meanwhile, the Eoin Morgan-led side will be keen on coming up with an allround performance and prevent their traditional rivals from getting off to a winning start.Venue: Melbourne Cricket GroundDate: 14th February 2015Start time: 9:00 AM ISTAustraliaThe co-hosts of the 2015 World Cup are in superb form, having lost only one of their last 13 ODIs. They overcame India and England with ease in the recently-concluded tri-series and are looking set to extend their good form into the World Cup. With explosive batsmen like David Warner and Aaron Finch at the top of the order, and with both players in good form, Australia possibly have the best opening pair in the tournament. The middle order too is packed with quality players like Shane Watson, Steven Smith, George Bailey, Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell. In fact, Australia's batting order goes all the way down to number 10 considering that Brad Haddin, Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc can pack quite a punch as well. The bowling unit too is well balanced despite the absence of James Faulkner.Team News:Michael Clarke and James Faulkner are ruled out of this game while Australia are unlikely to include left-arm spinner Xavier Doherty. Pat Cummins and Hazlewood will be fighting for a spot in the eleven with Johnson and Starc as the other frontline pacers. Another option for Australia is to include both at the expense of Mitchell Marsh.Probable XI: David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Steven Smith, George Bailey (capt), Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin (wk), Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood/Pat Cummins.EnglandEngland, under Eoin Morgan, will be playing without any expectations, considering their poor ODI form. Taking the captaincy away from Alastair Cook has done little to change the fortunes of the side, apart from a couple of wins against India in the recent tri-series. England's ODI form has been dismal in the last couple of years. Since 2013, England have only managed a couple of series wins - against New Zealand in Feb. 2013 and West Indies in Feb. 2014 (One-off wins against Scotland and Ireland not considered.) Although they do have a decent batting line-up with the presence of Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, Eoing Morgan and Ravi Bopara among others, only a little pressure is required for England to crack. A quality seam attack is what they will count on to get the job done.Team News:Chris Woakes is likely to be included in the eleven and might open the bowling with James Anderson, while Stuart Broad and Steven Finn will provide the back-up. England are unlikely to include James Tredwell in the line-up unless the nature of the pitch forces them to.Probable XI: Ian Bell, Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (capt), Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler (wk), Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad, Steve Finn, James Anderson. Watch out for:David Warner: James Anderson has said that the hot-headed Australian opener, who is just another spat away from suspension, does not need "too much encouragement" to get riled up. Warner may well decide to give it back to England, but with the bat, and if he does make it big, it will have a devastating effect on Eoin Morgan's team.Eoin Morgan: Soon after the tri-series, the England captain began his mind-games in order to unsettle Australia's premium pacer Mitchell Johnson. Morgan might be slightly wary of the left-arm quick, but it he does manage to get the better of Johnson, it would do wonders for England's confidence.Numbers:2: The number of times England have won against Australia in their last 10 ODI encounters. They have also won only twice in six World Cup matches against Australia and their last World Cup win came in 1992. 1: The number of individual centuries in Australia-England World Cup matches. Kevin Pietersen scored one in the 2007 World Cup, but it came in a losing cause. Ricky Ponting's 86 in the same game is the highest by an Australian against England in the World Cup.Quotes:Our record as a team in the games that I've played is bloody good I reckon, and I'll stand behind that and what we've achieved as a group-George BaileyTo play at the MCG in front of a full house against Australia in a World Cup is something every player dreams of and we're all so excited about it- James AndersonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
