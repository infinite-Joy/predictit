AUSTRALIA:48.6 48.6U Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run, Australia take a 2-0 lead! This is now the highest successful run-chase by a team at the Gabba. They made that record at the WACA in the last game and they have done it today as well. Coming to the ball, it was short and wide outside off, Maxwell cuts it straight to backward point and sets off, Bailey would have been a goner had Jadeja found the stumps with his throw, but he missed and the batsmen complete the run

AUSTRALIA:48.3 U Yadav to Maxwell, 2 runs, another one in the air and it lands in no man's land.

AUSTRALIA:47.3 Barinder to Maxwell, 1 run, a full toss and Maxwell would feel that he missed out on a freebie there.

AUSTRALIA:46.4 Ishant to Bailey, 2 runs, in the air and safe!

AUSTRALIA:46.3 Ishant to Bailey, FOUR, Bailey will be disappointed that he didn't get a maximum for that.

AUSTRALIA:43.6 Barinder to Bailey, 1 run, angled into the stumps from round the wicket, worked in front of mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:43.5 Barinder to Bailey, FOUR, oh no! Not quite the length to be bowling. But he's only a youngster. Will learn. Short with ample width on offer, flayed over backward point with a boisterous cut shot
AUSTRALIA:43.4 Barinder to Maxwell, 1 run, another off-cutter on middle and leg, easily glanced down to fine leg
AUSTRALIA:43.3 Barinder to Maxwell, no run, cuts the pace right off the ball on this back of a length delivery, Maxwell waited. And waited. And waited. Then tried to glide and missed
AUSTRALIA:43.2 Barinder to Bailey, 1 run, fullish and whipped off the pads through mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:43.1 Barinder to Bailey, SIX, now that's in the slot and been catapulted over long-off.

No better way to bring up a fiftyBarinder Sran [7.0-1-34-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:42.6 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, back of a length delivery on middle, Bailey shuffles across and tucks it behind square
AUSTRALIA:42.5 U Yadav to Bailey, FOUR, outside edge flies past Dhoni. Nothing he can do. Full outside off, Bailey looks to launch it straight back, only manages an edge which flies away
AUSTRALIA:42.4 U Yadav to Bailey, no run, loopy tennis ball bounce on this bumper which takes it over Bailey's head. Loud boos as the crowd believed it was a wide
AUSTRALIA:42.3 U Yadav to Maxwell, 3 runs, here's the gung-ho approach from the Big Show. Perfectly on a good length outside off, he just stands there and hoists it over extra-cover. Big, big chase for deep cover who has to run across to his right
AUSTRALIA:42.2 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, short and wide, slapped hard past backward point. Sweeper cover does very well to get across and keep the scoring to a single
AUSTRALIA:42.1 U Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run, stays leg-side of a zippy back of a length delivery on off, steers it down to third man
AUSTRALIA:41.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Bailey, no run, flatter and skidding on from a length on off, Bailey prods forward and blocks
AUSTRALIA:41.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Maxwell, 1 run, now the reverse. Slightly early on the shot, hits it from toe end of the bat, luckily it balloons over extra-cover
AUSTRALIA:41.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Maxwell, 2 runs, sliced off the leading edge over extra-cover. A very low percentage shot looking to whip it from off-stump, turns slightly to get him undone. But he rolled the wrists so furiously that the ball cleared the infield with ease
AUSTRALIA:41.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Maxwell, no run, flatter and sliding on towards off, Maxwell stays rooted and blocks
AUSTRALIA:41.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Maxwell, no run, gets it to turn at quick pace. Darted on a length just outside off, rips away against the angle. Maxwell did well to hang back and pat it into the off-side
AUSTRALIA:41.1 Ravindra Jadeja to Bailey, 1 run, skips down the track, meets the pitch and drives it down to long-offRavindra Jadeja [7.0-0-42-1] is back into the attack65 from 54. A breeze?
AUSTRALIA:40.6 U Yadav to Maxwell, no run, hops across to cover the line of a back of a length delivery and blocks it back down the pitchGlenn Maxwell, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:40.5 U Yadav to Smith, out Bowled!! "His arrogance has got him out," was Harsha Bhogle's reaction as soon as the bails went flying. Can't put it more aptly. Backs away to a length ball looking to carve through the off-side, the ball sneaks under his cross-batted willow and knocks over the top of off. Smith b U Yadav 46(47) [4s-4]U Yadav to Smith, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
AUSTRALIA:40.4 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, now swivels a full 360 degrees to pull a bouncer down towards fine leg

AUSTRALIA:40.2 U Yadav to Smith, 1 run, arrowed in on middle on a good length, Smith wrists it down to long-on

AUSTRALIA:39.5 Ishant to Smith, 1 run, backs away again and drills this full ball wide of mid-off who runs around to fieldThe bets have been floored, and a bloke has ran onto the field sidestepping security guards. He's had his moment in the sun. Let's get on with the game
AUSTRALIA:39.4 Ishant to Smith, FOUR, that's been speared back past the bowler. Opened his stance to a length ball and slammed it back. Couldn't quite time it as well but his exaggerated bat-swing deceived Ishant who was surprised by the lack of pace. Hence was in no position to catch
AUSTRALIA:39.3 Ishant to Bailey, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, patted down to third man
AUSTRALIA:39.2 Ishant to Bailey, no run, leg-cutter from Ishant which takes the faintest of edges but lands short of the keeper. Surely there must be some communication and the keeper should come up, no? Bailey made room looking to glide it down, had to wait for an eternity for the ball to arrive and ended up nicking it behind. Gets away
AUSTRALIA:39.1 Ishant to Bailey, FOUR, when it ain't going your way, nothing works. Inside edge whizzes past leg-stump and into the fine leg fence. Bailey was on the walk looking to force a length ball through the off-side, only manages to chop it behind
AUSTRALIA:39.1 Ishant to Bailey, wide, and again Ishant mistakes a right-hander for a left-hander. Down leg side and his wide count keeps spurtingIshant Sharma [7.0-0-30-1] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:38.6 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, length ball patted wide of cover
AUSTRALIA:38.5 U Yadav to Bailey, no run, full now and blasted down wide of mid-off. Brilliant work from the fielder running across and diving to stop

AUSTRALIA:38.3 U Yadav to Smith, 1 run, walks across the stumps and picks it off the hips through square leg
AUSTRALIA:38.2 U Yadav to Smith, no run, short again from Yadav, and Smith plays the most audacious stroke you'll see. Backs away and chops it towards extra-cover while looking to Federer-smash it over mid-off
AUSTRALIA:38.1 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, short and wide, ferociously slapped to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:37.6 Ashwin to Smith, 2 runs, on the pads and flicked behind square in the pocket. Hares back for the second
AUSTRALIA:37.5 Ashwin to Smith, FOUR, super! What more do I say? He's cut that from middle and off stump. Backs away to make room, knows Ashwin is bowling flat and the length will be short, and threads it between backward point and short third man with a back-cut
AUSTRALIA:37.4 Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run, quick and flat on the pads, clipped wide enough of the man at square leg to facilitate a single
AUSTRALIA:37.3 Ashwin to Smith, 1 run, darted on the stumps, Smith punches it down to long-on from the crease
AUSTRALIA:37.2 Ashwin to Smith, 2 runs, if Rahane couldn't prevent the two, no one could have. In this team at least. Down the track comes Smith and chips it elegantly straight of long-on. He is plundering away
AUSTRALIA:37.1 Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run, tossed up on middle, too full to trouble anyone. Bailey works it down to long-on
AUSTRALIA:36.6 U Yadav to Bailey, 1 run, back of a length delivery outside off, steered down to third man
AUSTRALIA:36.5 U Yadav to Bailey, no run, woah, now that's how you do it. Pounded on a short of length just outside off, climbed on Bailey as he was looking to glide it away. Whirred past the outside edge
AUSTRALIA:36.4 U Yadav to Bailey, FOUR, swatted over mid-wicket. Really poor stuff from Yadav. He's had a horror evening and the nightmare continues. Short ball without any sense or purpose. Bailey says hell yeah, "feed me more". Rocks back and dispatches the pull with disdain
AUSTRALIA:36.3 U Yadav to Bailey, no run, just short of length in the channel, Bailey hangs back and drops it into the off-side
AUSTRALIA:36.2 U Yadav to Bailey, 2 runs, slapped hard backward of point where the fielder saw the ball zoom wide of him. Hint of width outside off and Bailey just lashed it away without bothering to keep it down. Third man cuts it off but not before a couple has been pinched

AUSTRALIA:35.4 Ashwin to Smith, no run, this is flicked straight to square leg
AUSTRALIA:35.3 Ashwin to Smith, 2 runs, excellent running and Dhoni is not happy with the fielder there. Smith tucked this shortish delivery into the vacant mid-wicket region and raced back to the second run
AUSTRALIA:35.2 Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run, top-edge but safe. Flighted delivery down the leg-side, Bailey edges the pull, but there was no one at backward square leg to swallow the ball
AUSTRALIA:35.1 Ashwin to Bailey, no run, flighted delivery on the stumps, Bailey advances and flicks it to mid-wicketDrinks are on the field now. India have made a comeback of sorts, after a sensational 145-run opening stand between Finch and Marsh. The batsmen have found it hard to time the ball when pace is taken off. The equation reads 110 off 90 balls and we are heading towards a tight finish. Remember, the Aussies still have the likes of Maxwell, Wade and Faulkner to come.
AUSTRALIA:34.6 Kohli to Smith, no run, almost dragged that back onto the sticks. Full and outside off stump, Smith tries to dig it out, gets an inside edge that rolls past the stumps
AUSTRALIA:34.5 Kohli to Smith, FOUR, way too short and too easy for Smith, who helps himself to a boundary. He rocks back and pulls it through mid-wicket, long-on had no chance
AUSTRALIA:34.4 Kohli to Bailey, 1 run, oh now Bailey mistimes the lofted drive, it goes to the left of the bowler to long-off
AUSTRALIA:34.3 Kohli to Bailey, no run, very full from Kohli, Bailey tries to drive, but toe-ends it back to the bowlerThis is interesting from Dhoni. He's brought on Kohli. Remember, the Indians found it very tough when the pace was taken off the ball. Kohli is gentle with his pace and the batsmen will have to manufacture some to get boundaries. Let's see if this experiment works.
AUSTRALIA:34.2 Kohli to Smith, 1 run, drives it down to long-off
AUSTRALIA:34.1 Kohli to Bailey, 1 run, very full and on the stumps, Bailey mistimes the slog to deep mid-wicketVirat Kohli, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
AUSTRALIA:33.6 Ashwin to Smith, no run, oh beaten and that almost shaved the leg stump! Shortish and spinning back in, Ashwin cramped Smith for room there as he backed away, Smith tried to punch off the back foot but missed it completely. Soft appeal for caught behind from Ashwin, but umpire Richard Kettleborough shook his head
AUSTRALIA:33.5 Ashwin to Smith, no run, flighted delivery on the leg stump, Smith finds Kohli again. This is good bowling from Ashwin
AUSTRALIA:33.4 Ashwin to Smith, no run, Smith flicks this time, but Kohli intercepts at mid-wicket

AUSTRALIA:33.2 Ashwin to Smith, no run, this is pushed off the back foot to backward point
AUSTRALIA:33.1 Ashwin to Smith, 2 runs, lofted nicely, a calculated hit from Smith to put it in the gap and long-on is very deep to prevent the second
AUSTRALIA:32.6 Barinder to Bailey, no run, short and wide outside off stump, should have been put away, but Bailey cuts it straight to backward point
AUSTRALIA:32.5 Barinder to Bailey, FOUR, Bailey has no problems timing the ball though! Sran overpitches one right in the slot and Bailey lofts straight down the ground back over the bowler's head. That will ease some tension in the Aussie dressing room
AUSTRALIA:32.4 Barinder to Smith, 1 run, oh ho ho! That would have been a wide but Smith decides to reach out and put bat on ball. This is the slower ball full toss, bowled around 93kph, Smith toe-ends it to mid-off
AUSTRALIA:32.4 Barinder to Smith, no ball, and again, no timing whatsoever from the Australian captain, but hang on, Sran has overstepped and a free-hit comes Smith's way. Probably this is the slice of luck he needed to turn things around. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Smith toe-ends the slap to mid-offThis is so unlike Smith! He's been struggling for timing for the last few balls. Something's gonna give?
AUSTRALIA:32.3 Barinder to Smith, no run, very full and outside off stump, Smith mistimes the drive to mid-off
AUSTRALIA:32.2 Barinder to Bailey, 1 run, Bailey slashes and gets a thick edge, but it's not thick enough to travel to third man. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Bailey gets an edge and gets away with it
AUSTRALIA:32.1 Barinder to Smith, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Smith mistimes the cut to cover point
AUSTRALIA:31.6 Ashwin to Bailey, no run, too straight, Bailey flicks it to mid-wicket

AUSTRALIA:31.4 Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run, Bailey flicks this along the ground to deep mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:31.3 Ashwin to Bailey, FOUR, now how did that miss the stumps? Beat Dhoni as well! The Gabba bounce folks, the Gabba bounce. That's what saved Bailey there. The Aussie No. 4 was right across and exposed all three sticks as he tried to paddle, missed and it bounced over the leg stump. Dhoni moved to his left but he moved so much and it beat him to his right. Should have been byes that, I don't think there was any bat/glove involved
AUSTRALIA:31.2 Ashwin to Smith, 1 run, a good-looking back foot punch to long-on from Smith as Ashwin bowled a short one
AUSTRALIA:31.1 Ashwin to Bailey, 1 run, flighted delivery on the off stump, Bailey flicks it to deep mid-wicketRavichandran Ashwin [6.0-0-34-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:30.6 Barinder to Smith, 2 runs, width on offer outside off stump, Smith mistimes the cut to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:30.5 Barinder to Smith, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, cut to backward point
AUSTRALIA:30.4 Barinder to Bailey, 3 runs, "shoottt" say a couple of my colleagues on seeing Bailey play a lovely cover drive, but credit to Umesh for running a lot of distance to his right from sweeper cover and saving a run with a dive
AUSTRALIA:30.3 Barinder to Smith, 1 run, shortish from Sran, Barinder toe-ends the pull wide of mid-on
AUSTRALIA:30.2 Barinder to Smith, no run, Smith is swinging his bat folks and he almost inside-edged it onto the sticks. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Smith tries to pull, gets an edge onto boot, it was in the air for a while, but the hang-time wasn't long enough for cover to rush forward and take a catch
AUSTRALIA:30.1 Barinder to Smith, 2 runs, short and wide, cut hard, but Sran is very lucky that the fielder at backward point dived to his right and got a hand on itBarinder Sran [5.0-1-18-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:29.6 Ishant to Bailey, no run, short of length delivery just outside off stump, Bailey defends. Good over from Ishant, just a single in it and the wicket of MarshGeorge Bailey, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:29.5 Ishant to S Marsh, out Caught by Kohli!! No one's dropping this. A dolly and Kohli calls for it early, takes an easy catch. Ishant has got his reward for some fine bowling. He didn't experiment too much and stuck to bowling in the corridor of uncertainty and it has worked for him. Short of a length delivery just outside off stump, Marsh tries to flick, but the ball bounced extra and foxed him. Took the leading edge and went straight up in the air, Kohli moved to his right from cover and made no mistake. Second wicket for India in fairly quick time. How are the Aussies going to react? S Marsh c Kohli b Ishant 71(84) [4s-5]Ishant to S Marsh, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!Pandey again at fly slip

AUSTRALIA:28.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, 1 run, very full and on the stumps, Smith flicks it to deep mid-wicket. Excellent over from Jadeja, just 2 singles off it and I think the over lasted only about 90 seconds
AUSTRALIA:28.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, no run, short and wide outside off stump, Smith reaches out and tries to dab late, but gets beaten
AUSTRALIA:28.4 Ravindra Jadeja to S Marsh, 1 run, oh the round-armish quicker delivery, Marsh was hurried with his flick, toe-ends it into the off-side
AUSTRALIA:28.3 Ravindra Jadeja to S Marsh, no run, short mid-wicket in play again, this was the quicker delivery, Marsh mistimed the punch

AUSTRALIA:27.5 Ishant to Smith, 2 runs, short of length delivery outside off stump, there is that lazy dab from Smith to third man
AUSTRALIA:27.4 Ishant to S Marsh, 1 run, edged and dropped. It's Manish Pandey! Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Marsh opens the face of the bat and tries to guide, why would you do that with a man at slip, the ball takes a thick edge, Pandey was very wide at slip and tried to grab it inches from the ground after diving to his right, but couldn't hold on. So Marsh has been put down 4 times today. What did he have in the morning?
AUSTRALIA:27.3 Ishant to S Marsh, no run, fullish and just outside off stump, Marsh drives off the front foot and finds mid-off, who makes a diving save
AUSTRALIA:27.2 Ishant to S Marsh, 2 runs, short of length delivery on the leg stump, tucked wide of mid-on, Ashwin gives chase and hunts it down

AUSTRALIA:26.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, 1 run, tossed up outside off stump, Smith leans forward and drives it to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:26.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, FOUR, in the air but safe. That's risky from Smith, but he won't mind after all he knows how to play against the Indians. Flighted delivery on the stumps, Smith steps out and flicks uppishly, the man at mid-wicket dives to his right but it escapes past him
AUSTRALIA:26.2 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, no run, "yours" says Dhoni to Jadeja as Smith drives one straight back at the bowlerSlip in for Smith

AUSTRALIA:25.6 Ishant to S Marsh, 1 run, this is dabbed towards backward point for an easy single
AUSTRALIA:25.5 Ishant to S Marsh, no run, now that is what happens when you get the seam position and the line right. Beaten all ends up and remember, he's batting on 64. Top ball that from Ishant. Short of a length delivery angled across and very close to the off stump, Marsh tries to run it down to third man, but the extra bounce surprised him there
AUSTRALIA:25.4 Ishant to S Marsh, no run, fullish and attacking the sticks, Marsh defends it back to the bowler and then tells himself that he should have flicked that ball through mid-wicket. I agree with him there, the line was too straight and the shot was on
AUSTRALIA:25.3 Ishant to S Marsh, 2 runs, short of length delivery outside off stump, Marsh late-cuts it to square third man, he wanted the third, but Smith sent him back and rightly so. A third run would have been very tight
AUSTRALIA:25.2 Ishant to S Marsh, no run, slightly back of a length, Marsh defends off the back foot
AUSTRALIA:25.1 Ishant to S Marsh, no run, on a good length and around the off stump, Marsh defends into the off-sideIshant Sharma [4.0-0-19-0] is back into the attackCan Smith continue his love affair with the Indian bowlers?
AUSTRALIA:24.6 Ravindra Jadeja to Smith, no run, flighted delivery on the off stump, Smith defendsSteven Smith, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:24.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, out Caught by Rahane!! Now that is how you take a catch. Gee, how good is he, Jinks Rahane? Look at the determination in his eyes after taking that catch. This is the sort of inspiration India desperately needed at this stage. Hang on, they are checking if it carried cleanly and I have no problems with it. Anyway, let's go through the process, Jadeja's front foot is fine, meaning it's a legal delivery. Now the zoomer comes in and Rahane's fingers are under it. The verdict is passed onto the on-field umpire, who raises his finger. End of a handy innings from Finch. Flighted delivery outside off stump, Finch went really hard at this as he tried to loft, but didn't hit it too well and it went off the outside half of the bat. Rahane ran forward from long-off, dived full length forward and grabbed it inches from the ground. So that ends a fine 145-run association. Finch c Rahane b Ravindra Jadeja 71(81) [4s-7 6s-1]Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:24.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, 2 runs, oh the inside-out lofted drive, but Rahane quickly runs to his left and makes an excellent save

AUSTRALIA:23.1 U Yadav to S Marsh, 1 run, in the airrrr and that's a stunning effort by Barinder Sran. Extremely tough dropped chance. One thing is for sure, this wasn't a wicket-taking delivery at all. Short and on the leg stump, Marsh pulls fine, Sran runs to his left, dives full length and goes two-handed at it, but it pops out. Great effort that and he did well to keep it to a single as well
AUSTRALIA:23.1 U Yadav to S Marsh, wide, short and down the leg-side, Marsh will feel that he missed out on a boundary as a fine little tickle would have been enough, anyway, he gets an extra delivery nowUmesh Yadav [4.0-0-30-0] is back into the attackAustralia have scored 42 runs in the last three overs now. Ashwin has some encouraging words for Umesh, who is about to bowl now.

AUSTRALIA:22.5 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, 1 run, driven along the ground to long-onNow Dhoni has a chat with Jadeja
AUSTRALIA:22.4 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, FOUR, this is a fine counterattack from the Aussies. Surely they must have discussed this in the drinks break and so far, both Finch and Marsh have executed the plan very well. Very full and on the stumps, Finch slogs over mid-wicket and there is no one protecting the boundary
AUSTRALIA:22.3 Ravindra Jadeja to Finch, FOUR, Dhawan and Ishant give chase, but the ball wins the race. Short and outside off stump, Finch cuts it between backward point and short third man once again as he did in the previous over and picks up four more

AUSTRALIA:21.2 Ashwin to S Marsh, 1 run, short and outside off stump, Marsh cuts it to sweeper cover and that brings up his fifty
AUSTRALIA:21.1 Ashwin to S Marsh, 2 runs, oh this could be tight! Oh dear! What were you doing Ashwin? Surely, he had to collect and take the bails off. Marsh works this into the on-side, Finch sets off for a quick single, but Marsh was late to respond, the fielder has a shy at the bowler's end, but misses. Marsh was not even in the frame and would have out by a yard or so even if Ashwin had collected and taken the bails off
AUSTRALIA:20.6 U Yadav to Finch, SIX, now that is a top shot! Finch is turning it on and what a way to get to his fifty - his 10th in ODIs. Full and on the stumps, Finch plays the pick-up shot, hits it deliberately in the air and just about manages to clear the man at deep square leg
AUSTRALIA:20.5 U Yadav to Finch, FOUR, in the air, not timed well, but mid-off is inside the ring and that turns out to be a safe hit. 100 partnership comes up with that hit. Full delivery on the off stump, Finch lofts the drive over mid-off's head
AUSTRALIA:20.4 U Yadav to Finch, no run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Finch hops and turns it into the on-side

AUSTRALIA:20.2 U Yadav to S Marsh, 1 run, Marsh inside-edges the flick onto his pad, as the ball rolls to short mid-wicket, they take a sharp single. Rahane has a shy at the bowler's end and misses, but Marsh was well home. In fact, looks like the ball has missed the protection and hit Marsh flush on the right leg. He's feeling some pain
AUSTRALIA:20.1 U Yadav to Finch, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Finch toe-ends the back foot punch, the balls rolls towards the keeper and Marsh calls for a quick single

AUSTRALIA:19.2 Ashwin to S Marsh, 1 run, Marsh drives off the front foot, waits for the ball to pass short mid-wicket and the bowler and then sets off for a single
AUSTRALIA:19.1 Ashwin to Finch, 1 run, flighted delivery on the off stump, Finch drives it down to long-onDrinks are on the field now. Turns out that Australia have got off to a good start. However, it has to be said that the openers weren't fluent enough and the Indians did not grab their opportunities as well. A couple of catches were put down, a close chance for a run-out was missed as well. The interesting thing is that the spinners are getting a bit of purchase and both Marsh and Finch weren't comfortable playing the tweakers. Don't take your eyes off this folks, it's going to be exciting...
AUSTRALIA:18.6 U Yadav to Finch, 1 run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Finch hops and works this through square leg

AUSTRALIA:17.5 Ashwin to S Marsh, 1 run, on the leg stump, tucked through backward square leg
AUSTRALIA:17.4 Ashwin to Finch, 1 run, that's lazy from Ashwin. Should have been a dot ball. The slider on the off stump, didn't turn and went straight on, Finch drove it to the right of the bowler, who tried to stop with one hand and fumbled
AUSTRALIA:17.3 Ashwin to S Marsh, 1 run, there is a bit of drift into the left-hander on this one for Ashwin, but the length was short and Marsh had enough time to rock and cut through point
AUSTRALIA:17.2 Ashwin to S Marsh, no run, width on offer outside off stump, Marsh backs away and slices, but picks out backward point
AUSTRALIA:17.1 Ashwin to S Marsh, no run, nice and full from Ashwin, driven back to the bowler
AUSTRALIA:16.6 U Yadav to Finch, no run, very full from Yadav, Finch digs it out
AUSTRALIA:16.5 U Yadav to S Marsh, 1 run, this is on the stumps, but too straight and allows Marsh to easily work it to deep mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:16.4 U Yadav to S Marsh, FOUR, that's the second boundary of the over, just what the Aussies wanted. Why would you want to try a slower ball now? This one goes down the leg-side and all Marsh needed to do was tickle it fine and he didn't miss out
AUSTRALIA:16.3 U Yadav to Finch, leg byes, 1 run, another glance missed, this time by Finch, he's livid with himself for missing out on the tickle, the ball rolls behind square off the pad

AUSTRALIA:7.3 Ishant to Finch, no run, "Ishant Sharma has not found his rhythm as yet" asserts VVS on air. Well said! Short of a length swinging in on off, Finch bunts it onto the pitch.

Marsh responds in kind, beating Manish Pandey's direct hit at the striker's endDisappointing first two overs from Ishant Sharma. Yes, he's not played ODIs for a while but that should be no excuse for him for not being able to control the swing. It's been wide outside off or down the leg side so far. There is swing on offer, but just that he hasn't bowled enough in the corridor of uncertainty. In fact, he even got a couple to swing nicely with great seam presentation, but they were ill-directed to Finch. Now why he is struggling to control the new ball? Wasn't he practicing in the nets with the new ball? Remember, this is international cricket and Ishant, or any other bowler for that matter, cannot afford such silly errors on a match-day. He's developed himself into a good Test match bowler nowadays. Can he use the experience and do well in ODIs as well? Time will tell.

AUSTRALIA:0.4 Barinder to Finch, no run, better length this time, on a good length around off, Finch presents a solid forward defence

INDIA:0.1 Barinder to Finch, wide, starts off with a short and wide delivery, was too high and wide of off, Finch watches it sail through to the keeperFinch and S Marsh are at the crease. Finch is on strike. Barinder will open the attackThe conditions look a bit bleak out there. The floodlights are on. Shaun Marsh and Finch march out to the middle. Barinder Sran, who impressed everyone on his debut, will start the proceedings for India. Finch will take strike. 2 slips in place. Right then! Off we go...Startling stat: This will offer Indian fans some respite. The highest chase at this venue till date - 301/9 by Australia against England in 2014. Be back for Australia's response in about 40 minutes...Luck was on his side as the umpire didn't spot the edge when he nicked one to the keeper on 89. But misfortune followed him soon as Faulkner palmed Rahane's lofted drive back onto the stumps. Rahane though kept himself busy at the crease by ticking the scoreboard and acknowledging the boundary balls. He ensured that the runs never dried up by picking singles more often than not - something that was missing during Rohit-Kohli's 125-run stand. Rahane certainly looked a class apart but fell short of a hundred by 11 runs after a fluent knock. Australia made a good comeback in the final 5 overs - just conceded 38 runs and consumed 5 wickets.At the end of 17 overs in the first ODI, India were 82/1. Fast forward three days later, India were 82/1 again. Only thing that changed was the venue and India fell short by one run of the final total. Rohit and Kohli looked as firm as they were in the first ODI. However, the lack of urgency during the middle overs seemed to have hurt India, yet again. Only time will tell how costly will that prove. After India lost Dhawan early, Kohli took on Richardson's arm (the best fielder in the outfield according to Brett Lee) and threw away a great opportunity to score a hundred. Rohit thumped his way to yet another hundred - a knock that saw a few streaky strokes, thunderbolts and who can deny his class! 4
INDIA:49.6 Hastings to Ravindra Jadeja, out Ravindra Jadeja Run Out!! So India have got one run lesser than what they got at the WACA. This is a strong comeback from Australia and going into the break, they will feel the momentum is with them. Yorker from Hastings, Jadeja digs it out down the pitch, Yadav tries to steal a run, but the ball was close to Hastings, who picked it up, ran back and easily dislodged the bails. Jadeja was not even in the picture. Ravindra Jadeja run out (Hastings) 5(5)Hastings to Ravindra Jadeja, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
INDIA:49.5 Hastings to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, very full and outside off stump, Jadeja walks across and tries to scoop, but misses
INDIA:49.4 Hastings to Ravindra Jadeja, 2 runs, that's strange cricket from India. Firstly, the full toss was only hit gently along the ground to long-on, secondly, the batsmen weren't pushing for the second run. Oh a fumble from Hastings allows Jadeja to complete the second eventually. It was a straightforward throw to the bowler but he spilled itUmesh Yadav, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:49.3 Hastings to Ashwin, out Caught by Boland!! The slump continues for India and they have lost 3 wickets in a space of 7 balls now. Full and on the off stump, Ashwin walks across and tries to scoop it over short fine leg, but gets a top-edge, goes only as far as short third man, who moves to his left and takes the catch.

INDIA:49.2 Hastings to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, full and on the off stump, Jadeja for some reason only defends this with an angled bat towards backward point. Probably he was expecting a slower ball there

INDIA:48.3 Faulkner to Rahane, out Caught by Smith!! In the airrrrrrr, I don't think this has got enough legs and he holes out in the deep. End of a fine innings from Rahane. Slower delivery on the stumps, Rahane steps out and slogs, but the lack of pace on the ball meant he completely mistimed the shot, Smith moves to his right at deep mid-wicket and takes a simple catch.

INDIA:23.5 Boland to Kohli, out Kohli Run Out!! 1 run completed. This is bizarre. I mean how many times there will be a run-out with these two. It's so ridiculous that it's almost laughable. Short ball which was pulled behind square, Kohli was always going for two. Didn't spot any hesitation so it comes down to bad judgement I guess. Richardson swoops in from fine leg, rifles it straight over the stumps, Wade collects and whips the bails. Kohli is atleast 6 inches short despite a valiant dive. Kohli run out (Kane Richardson/Wade) 59(67) [4s-4]Boland to Kohli, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!

Rohit is on strike. Joel Paris will open the attack"NO SCORE IS NOW TRULY SAFE" - these were the exact words from Rohit Sharma after the last game. Well! Isn't that true? The Australians are making their way out to the middle. The Indian openers too are out in the centre. Paris to start the proceedings. Two slips in place for him. Here we go then...Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, John Hastings, Kane Richardson, Scott Boland, Joel ParisIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma, Barinder SranSmith: "We have made three changes. We have got Richardson in for Hazlewood, he deserves a break. Shaun Marsh comes in for David Warner and Hastings gets a game for the rested Mitch Marsh. He's been playing well, everytime he has gone back to Big Bash or domestic cricket, he has scored runs and he deserves a chance with Warner not here because of the birth of his second child. It has been a fortress for us in all forms of cricket (talking about the Gabba). Looks a pretty good wicket. Hopefully, we can restrict them to a good total and chase it down. We had wickets in the shed so we could time the chase really well in the last game."Dhoni: "We are batting first. It looks like a good wicket, so we want to put runs on the board. It would have been good to get 20-25 runs more in the last match. There were quite a few misfields by the bowlers themselves. If we get 310 on this wicket, I think it could be a good total. The bowlers will now have a fair idea about what lengths to bowl. I think what's important to see is how the wickets are prepared. You look at the wicket and the conditions, then decide what you want to do. In place of Bhuvi, we have Ishant Sharma."India have won the toss and have opted to batOkay, so the weather. Bright, sunny and comfortable for now. There is talk of rain late afternoon but the balance of probability suggests it won't be much of a factor. The pitch looks another beauty. Faulkner dropped a veiled grumble at the pre-match presser as he failed to recollect when the pitch did have something for the bowlers. "This outfield is super quick. There will be a lot of runs. This is probably the best wicket in Australia at the moment. There are two cracks on this pitch, but I don't think it will be a concern. Even covering of grass means consistent bounce. You bat first, but maybe with a bit of rain around, the captain who wins the toss might bat second," reckon Dean Jones and Damien Martyn in the pitch report.Digressing a bit from the cricket, big congratulations to David Warner on the birth of his second daughter (yesterday). He is currently on paternity leave and will not be available for the next two ODIs. Right, back to business. It's widely expected that it will be Shaun Marsh taking Warner's place. However, there is the option of Usman Khawaja as well. Kind of a wildcard. Other than that, Mitch Marsh has been given a breather from this one with John Hastings being called up. I am also hearing that Halzewood might be given a break as well. It will be interesting to see what the visitors do to their XI. Knowing Dhoni, I would like to believe there won't be a lot of tinkering. But then, is that even a thing "Knowing Dhoni"?12:20 Local Time, 02:20 GMT, 07:50 IST: "Hope is a good thing. Perhaps the best of things," as The Shawshank Redemption serves to remind us. And India need to latch on to a good bunch of it. Make no mistake, they will be hurting. They threw everything they had at the WACA. But that's when Australia so cunningly sidestepped to trip them over. Now it's forwards and upwards in Brisbane, well the bounce certainly is. So hello all and welcome to our live coverage. This is Sagar Chawla and along with my fellow commentator, Sidhant Maheshwari, we will be seeking to update you with the latest from the Gabba. Just an hour's wait away from the first ball..Preview by Vishaal LoganathanIf the first One-Day International (ODI) between Australia and India was any indicator, the Brisbane game on Friday (January 15) is likely to only take things up a notch. Rohit Sharma, Steven Smith and Virat Kohli hit the headlines, but so did George Bailey's floppy hat, Barinder Sran, MS Dhoni and the Decision Review System (DRS).Australia managed to take a 1-0 lead after successfully chasing down 309, and will be keen on taking the momentum forward. A 2-0 lead will put immense pressure on the visitors, and Australia will try to ensure they take full advantage of a pitch that is expected to be, like the one in Perth, pacer-friendly.India, despite being 0-1 down, will know that the performance was still worthy of a win. They did well with the bat, struck early with the ball and had a great chance to get themselves a win. Smith and Bailey however turned things around with a stellar stand.Date and time: 15th January, 13:20 PM local time, 8:50 AM ISTWeather: Very slight chance of showersVenue: Gabba, BrisbaneTeamsIndia: The main conundrum India will hope to solve is about the spinners. Playing both R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja backfired on the visitors at Perth, and they will think twice before repeating the same. Dhoni had stressed before the series that spin was their key strength, and that they had to back that, so India might as well give the two-spinner ploy another shot.Ishant Sharma, who missed the first ODI with an injured finger, should be back in the side, taking Bhuvneshwar Kumar's place, while Rishi Dhawan and Axar Patel continue to wait on the sidelines. The tall right-armer bowled for more than twenty minutes in the nets and had the physios inspect his injured finger again. However, BCCI's media manager confirmed that the pacer is fit and ready for selection.Shikhar Dhawan's form at the top has been quite shaky, and India will want him to hit top gear soon. Rohit and Virat Kohli will continue to be the fulcrum of the line-up, while the likes of Ajinkya Rahane and Manish Pandey will hope they do not take too much time to acclimatize themselves to the conditions in Australia.Australia: Australia will be forced to make at least two changes to their winning combination. Mitchell Marsh has been rested for the game, while David Warner is on paternity leave. John Hastings and Usman Khawaja were brought in as reinforcements, but the duo could only serve as back-up.Shaun Marsh looks most likely to take Warner's slot at the top of the order, while Kane Richardson should fill in for Marsh. Hastings, however, comes in with years of experience and Australia could also be tempted to use him to shore up the inexperienced attack.Joel Paris and Scott Boland are expected to keep their spots despite not enjoying the best of debuts.Quotes:James Faulkner: I think in general, since Boofs (Darren Lehmann) taken over as coach, hes given us a hell of a lot of confidence as a batting group and as a group in general. He said the other night after the game, hed rather see us being bowled out for 200 while trying to reach 300-plus, than sort of nudging it around and making a meal of it. Ive had a hell of a lot of confidence playing under him and I know every other player in the group does as well, to try and stretch our limits as a group.Rohit Sharma: There were a lot of positives to be taken from that game especially scoring 300 runs in Perth. Losing the game was not such a positive thing, but again we did pretty much what we could have. They created very good partnerships and then we were not able to get back in the game. They batted really well. There were a lot of positives in our batting but we still need to work on our bowling and get those breakthroughs whenever there is a big partnership going on.Teams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Barinder Sran, Axar Patel, Ishant Sharma, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Rishi DhawanAustralia (From): Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), James Faulkner, John Hastings, Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland, Joel Paris, Kane Richardson, Usman KhawajaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
