Here we go with the first ball....Stat: Bailey's 156 is the 3rd highest score by any captain against India. Only Sanath Jayasuriya (189 at Sharjah) and Andrew Strauss (158 at Bangalore) have got bigger knocks.16:45 Local Time, 11:15 GMT, 16:45 IST: Another pitch where the bowlers were like lambs ready for slaughter, at least at the end of the Australian innings. India brought in three spinners, and the third one went for 78 without taking a wicket. Australia started slowly and lost both their openers with just 45 runs on the board. With the bowlers asserting themselves, it finally looked like a pitch where they would have a say in the things. Not so for long, Watson was reprieved after he was caught off a no-ball on 25, he then opened up and along with George Bailey took each and every bowler to the cleaners. He scored his 9th ODI ton, Bailey was even more impressive as he top-scored with a career best 156. Australia once again have posted a big score, nothing much to say about the Indian bowling, although to their credit, they finished the 50 overs well before the scheduled time. Join us at 17:30 for the chase..4

Here we go with the first ball....Teams:India (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed ShamiAustralia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Shane Watson, George Bailey(c), Adam Voges, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay, Xavier DohertyBailey: "We were looking to bat first. It has been a while without a game. That was a bit frustrating. We have played well so far, it is always good to perform against India. All the guys need to perform against a team like India. You can't expect one or two players to perform everytime. We are unchanged for today."Dhoni: "We are looking to chase, we will bowl first. There will be dew later so that's why we will bowl first. The outfield is fast and the wicket is good to bat on that's what makes it a high scoring ground. We will take it one match at a time. Vinay and Jaydev make way for Mishra and Bhuvi."India have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: "The pitch looks like a beauty. It is a high scoring ground. It will be another high scoring game. There is some dry grass. The only problem is the dew and the teams would like to bat first. The wicket might get a bit slow as the game progresses. Otherwise it is a good batting wicket", says Ravi ShastriAustralia on the other hand, have been nothing but impressive. They have been led superbly by their skipper Bailey who is the highest run-getter in the series. The bowling has been impressive, Johnson being the pick, as he has bowled fast and has been accurate. The top order of Finch, Hughes and Watson have clicked in almost all the matches. They need to win one more game to complete a series win. Toss and teams in a few minutes....Hello and welcome to the sixth ODI in Nagpur. After two washouts the series has been reduced to a 5-match series. India are trailing 1-2 and they have to win the last two matches if they have to win the series. The bowling has been a main worry for them, out of the 4 matches that Australia have batted they have scored 300 in 3 of them. Although they bowled much better in Ranchi, where Shami got the early wickets but the spinners didn't do much and still conceded 295. The batting has looked decent apart from a couple of them struggling to cope up with the pace and bounce of Johnson.PreviewThe equations are simple. After two washouts, the seven-match series has been reduced to five and India, trailing 1-2, need to win in Nagpur on Wednesday to ensure that the final game in Bangalore on November 2 does not become a dead rubber. Australia have made their intentions clear and they are going to come out all guns blazing at the VCA Stadium to avenge their humiliation in the Test series earlier this year. India, on the other hand, have had a great year and they would not want to lose a series at home at the fag end of the season.To cut a long story short, a cracker of a contest is on the cards in West India, with the sun shining bright and no forecast of rain for the entire week.India: Another high-scoring series at home and the pacers continue to disappoint on flat pitches. Ishant Sharma and Vinay Kumar have tried nothing new to contain the Australians on the flat decks and consequently Ishant sat out of the fourth game in Ranchi, paving the way for Mohammad Shami, who impressed immediately. Jaydev Unadkat, coming in for Bhuvneshwar Kumar, was miserly too and as a result, the Indian attack looked a little better. The two new balls have compounded problems for the bowlers but like MS Dhoni keeps on stressing, the bowlers will have to learn to bowl in the death. There is really no other way out.The batting has been powerful even with Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh yet to fire. Rohit Sharma made a huge statement with his match-winning ton in Jaipur, while Virat Kohli has been in phenomenal form. Dhoni of course is India's crisis man with the bat and he showed in Mohali just why he is the most dangerous limited overs batsman in the world today. If India have any concerns besides their death bowling, it's their numbers four and five in the batting line-up. Raina and Yuvraj have been softened up with some serious pace by Mitchell Johnson and the two southpaws will have to find ways to score. If the top order fails, it will be vital for Yuvraj to bring back his magical touch. Australia: They should have been back home Down Under and preparing for the Ashes instead of playing ODIs in India. Former Australian cricketers have been scathing in their criticism of the ongoing series but George Bailey's men have so far shown the world that they are getting back valuable confidence ahead of the series against England next month. The conditions will be vastly different but at least a series win here would do a world of good to team morale. Besides, the batsmen, Bailey and Glenn Maxwell in particular, have been in great touch while Johnson has been sensational, bowling with pace and accuracy against a star-studded Indian batting line-up.The surface in Jamtha could well be to Australia's liking, giving them a chance to wrap up the series before heading down south.Weather: Clear, sunny day with a maximum of 32 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 18 degrees.Quotes: "It's important to get our match-ups right. When we are bowling against their batsmen, we have got our match-ups right. Mitch Johnson certainly provides a big x-factor for us." - Shane Watson, Australian all-rounder."We have come here to win this game and we're not worried too much about Bangalore. At the moment we are worried about winning this game and wrapping it up on Wednesday." Xavier Doherty, Australian spinner."It's definitely challenging in terms of what the batsmen are doing. They are going for their shots. They are playing the high risk shots; the credit needs to be given. But as I said we keep trying to devise different strategies and see what we can do." R Ashwin, India spinner.Teams:Australia (From): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes, Shane Watson, George Bailey(c), Adam Voges, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Clint McKay, Xavier Doherty, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Moises Henriques, Callum FergusonIndia (From): Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Vinay Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Jaydev Unadkat, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Amit Mishra, Ambati RayuduLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
