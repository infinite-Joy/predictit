Shafiul Islam will open the attackWelcome backShakib has single handedly rescued Bangladesh from a hole after they were tottering at 44/3. He counter attacked right from the outset to shift the momentum towards the home team in the company of Rahim and Mahmudullah. Rahim fell thanks to a terrible mix-up with the skipper but Shakib didn't let that affect him, as he notched up his 5th ODI ton. He fell in the quest of quick runs towards the end, which opened the flood gates for the Kiwi bowlers to rip through the tail. Bangladesh would still believe they have enough on the board to defend and clinch a historic series win. The Kiwis will need McCullum to fire at the top if they are to redeem themselves and entertain hopes of levelling the series. Join us at 12:45 IST for the NZ innings.4

There is dead grass, there is some live grass which has been rolled in. The pitch will be slow and low. The pitch looks a bit flat, but the team that wins the toss will want to bowl first.Hello and Welcome to the live coverage of the 4th ODI between Bangladesh and New Zealand at Mirpur. Bangladesh will be looking for a historic series victory against a top cricket team, while New Zealand will be hoping to keep the series alive with a win today. Vettori's men are struggling for form currently and they will have to play some spectacular cricket if they have to defeat the Tigers. I am Sid V and I will be joined by Shashank. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.By Vishaal LoganathanBangladesh have served up a timely reminder to all the teams gearing up for the World Cup to not take them lightly and have proven how dangerous they can be in familiar conditions by beating the Kiwis twice. They had never beaten a top flight team on consecutive occasions, but New Zealand happened to be the unfortunate team to have the tag of the only top team to lose to Bangladesh twice in two matches.The first match was a keenly fought contest and Bangladesh eventually scraped through in the rain hit encounter. The second match was washed out due to rain and Bangladesh's spinners spun a web around the Kiwi batsmen to inspire the team to a 7 wicket victory in the 3rd of the 5 match series.Kiwi captain, Daniel Vettori blasted his team's batting performance and called for improvement if they have to pull one back in the 5 match series. Only Ross Taylor seemed to be in good nick while all other batsmen around him failed to give him support as the Kiwis were skittled out for 173. The Vettori-led side will have to pull up their socks and their batsmen will have to deliver the goods if they are to avoid going into the last encounter facing a 4-0 thrashing. Their bowling depends heavily on the ever reliable Daniel Vettori, but the likes of Kyle Mills and Nathan McCullum can support him well. They did not have much to defend in the 3rd ODI and will be hoping that their batsmen can contribute well with the bat.Bangladesh find themselves in a very unfamiliar position, leading the series 2-0 and going into a match as favourites and it will be interesting to see how they react. Stand in skipper Shakib Al Hasan has asked his team to iron out any errors and ensure they get a 4-0 series victory. Their bowlers have been in superb form, and they were the main architects of their memorable win at Dhaka. All their bowlers chipped in with wickets and kept the pressure on the Kiwis throughout and wiped them out for 173. Their batsmen too played well and ensured that the total was achieved with minimal fuss. The openers were in good form and put the game beyond doubt with an opening stand of 127.Bangladesh already have one hand on the trophy and will be going into the game with hopes of another victory. New Zealand on the other hand will have to work hard to ensure they don't repeat the mistakes they made in their 2 losses and get one over the Bangladeshis.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Imrul Kayes, Shahriar Nafees, Junaid Siddique, Raqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan(c), Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Mahmudullah, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Suhrawadi Shuvo, Jahurul Islam, Naeem Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza, Syed RaselNew Zealand (From): Jesse Ryder, Brendon McCullum, BJ Watling(w), Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Kane Williamson, Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Tim Southee, Andy McKay, Daryl Tuffey, Aaron Redmond, Hamish Bennett, Shanan StewartLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
