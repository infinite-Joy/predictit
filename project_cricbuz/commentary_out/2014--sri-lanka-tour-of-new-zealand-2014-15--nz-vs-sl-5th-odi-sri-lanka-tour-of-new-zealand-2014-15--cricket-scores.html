Southee will open the attackWelcome back. The Sri Lankan openers, Dilshan and Thirimanne are out in the middle. Tim Southee will open the bowlingSri Lanka will feel a little hard done by the Black Caps onslaught, but they have only themselves to blame. They kept bowling a number of full tosses and never got the yorkers right. After having the opposition reeling at 93/5, it must have been demoralizing for the Sri Lankans to see 360 on the board. However, now it is upto their batsmen to try and win this game for them. If they can't, New Zealand will take a 3-1 lead and Sri Lanka will stand no chance of winning the series. The second innings follows in a short while. Stay tuned.Elliott was also superb with the bat. He maintained a calm head and made sure that he kept handing the strike over to Ronchi, who was in belligerent form. Elliott may have played second fiddle to Ronchi, but he manages to outscore the number of balls he faced as well. He scored his second ODI ton and finished with 104 off 96 balls.Considering the pace at which this partnership came, it has been phenomenal. They scored these 267 runs off 180 balls. Ronchi was simply marvellous with the bat as he kept smashing the Sri Lankan bowlers to all corners of the park, reaching his maiden ODI ton in the process. His 170 came off 99 balls and he hit 14 fours and 9 sixes during his innings.Grant Elliott: 'It feels really good. He was striking it really well. It was a spectacle from him. Coming from a Wellington teammate, it feels good. In the World Cup, we will be presented with a lot of different scenarios, it gives us a lot of confidence if we can play like this. Luke was spectacular.'So, the Kiwis finish with 360 on the board. It has been a breathtaking partnership between Elliott and Ronchi. A record 267-run stand between these two, highest for 6th wicket in ODI cricket history. It has been a special innings from both Elliott and Ronchi. At the end of 20 overs, they were 93/5 and since then, it was all New Zealand.4

The Kiwis are 2-1 ahead in the series right now. For Sri Lanka to have any chance of winning this series, they need to win this ODI. In fact, they need to win all the three ODIs to win the series. A Black Caps win here would effectively mean that hosts can't lose the series even if they lose the final two. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.In the last game, the Sri Lankan trio - Dilshan, Sangakkara and Jayawardene - all batted well, but New Zealand still ran away with the win. The game was heading towards a close finish, but Luke Ronchi's quickfire 32 saw the Kiwis go past Sri Lanka's 276 in the 49th over. However, it was Kane Williamson's hundred and his partnerships with Elliott and Anderson that helped the Black Caps get close to the target, after being 63/3 at one stage.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Dimuth Karunaratne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Rangana Herath, Shaminda Eranga, Suranga Lakmal, Dhammika Prasad, Dinesh ChandimalNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent Boult, Kyle Mills, Nathan McCullum, Tom Latham, Matt HenryLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
