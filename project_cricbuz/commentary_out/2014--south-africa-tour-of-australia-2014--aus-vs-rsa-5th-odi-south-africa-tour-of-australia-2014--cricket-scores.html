Hashim Amla will captain the side in his absence. Maybe, it has something to do with the injury de Villiers suffered in the last game.Can South Africa notch up a win in the final game? Or will Australia continue their domination? We will find out soon. Stay tuned for the toss and teams.Hello and welcome to the final ODI between Australia and South Africa that is being played at Sydney. Both teams will look to try more team combinations ahead of the World Cup. Apart from the South African captain AB de Villiers, their batsmen haven't been consistent. Their bowling has also looked ordinary at times. In the last game, they couldn't close out the advantage after they left Australia 98/5 at one stage. But, a Steven Smith special saw Australia pip South Africa to the finish line.The series may have already been decided, but both teams will look to end on a winning note. South Africa will look to regain some lost pride and end the series with a win. On the other hand, if Australia manage to win today's game, they will overtake India to take the No. 1 position in the ODI rankings.PreviewAustralia may have already clinched the series against South Africa but they have the incentive of regaining the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings if they win the final game in Sydney.The Australians overhauled South Africa's 267 on the back of a thrilling century from Steve Smith to claim a three-wicket win over the Proteas with an over to spare in Melbourne on Friday to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-game series. While Australia have wrapped up the series, Smith said the home side won't be short of motivation in Sydney, where another win will ensure they reclaim No.1 spot from World Cup champions India."It adds a lot," Smith told reporters after Friday's win. "We pride ourselves on that. We try to get to No.1 in every form of the game. To win in Sydney would be great and to take that No.1 mantle back would be outstanding."Smith added that Australia's one-day form augurs well for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February, especially given the quality of the opposition. "South Africa are a very good line-up. To play the way we have and beat them 3-1, it's been very satisfying for us. It will be perfect to finish it off with a 4-1 victory and take back that No.1 spot. It's going to be nice playing the World Cup in our own backyard... hopefully, that (form) continues going into the World Cup."South African coach Russell Domingo said taking Smith's wicket would be key to his side finishing their limited-overs tour of Australia with a win. "He's obviously a big player for Australia at the moment and we've got to make sure our plans are in place when we play against him," Domingo said.Proteas captain AB de Villiers looked in pain in the final stages of Australia's innings on Friday, constantly feeling his ribs, but Domingo is hopeful he will play in Sunday's final ODI. "He just fell badly on his rib and I think he took a blow there in one of the games earlier in the series," Domingo said. "Maybe just a bit of bad bruising. I think he should be ok (for Sunday)."Domingo denied his side's first one-day loss to Australia in seven ODIs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was a World Cup setback and said Sunday would be a chance for his players to nail down a spot in the squad for that tournament."Sunday is another chance to see what the right group is ... we're pretty close to finalising (a squad). It's a great reminder of how much work still lies ahead before we can seriously challenge for the World Cup in three months' time."Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Ryan McLaren, Robin Peterson, Wayne Parnell, Kyle Abbott, Dale Steyn, Vernon Philander, Morne Morkel, Rilee RossouwAustralia (From): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Steven Smith, George Bailey(c), Matthew Wade(w), Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, Pat Cummins, Xavier Doherty, Mitchell Marsh, Josh HazlewoodLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
