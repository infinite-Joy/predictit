I had no pressure while batting with him. I wanted to bat along the ground. Shehzad kept hitting the boundaries and took the pressure off me. We were struggling in the first game against India. Then, we had a a meeting for 2 hours. We have learnt from our mistakes. I just needed the one innings. I am confident now. One of the top four batsmen will have to take the responsibility to bat through. Bowling is our strength. If the batsmen can put up a good total, then the bowlers can defend it."Pakistan's batting fired once again and they end up with a massive score on the board. The star was Ahmed Shehzad, he was sublime with his stroke-play and kept the score ticking along. Eventually, he became the first Pakistan batsman to score a T20I century. Shoaib Malik played the anchor, while Shahid Afridi blitzed towards the end. The bowling was a tale of two halves, the pacers were thrashed to all parts of the ground, but the spinners managed to keep things tight. Rahim will wonder if he made the right call to drop a spinner on this track. Bangladesh now need a mountain to climb, if they are to keep their hopes, as well as Australia's alive in the tournament.

Ahmed Shehzad is on strike. Mortaza will open the attackMassive game for both teams, but a third team, Australia will be watching all the action with hawk eyes. The players are out in the middle. We are set for the start of the 27th Match of the T20 Cup.Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Shamsur Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mahmudullah, Ziaur Rahman, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafe Mortaza, Al-Amin HossainPakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Mohammad Hafeez(c), Umar Akmal, Shoaib Malik, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul, Zulfiqar Babar, Saeed AjmalRahim: "We will definitely try to improve in the batting area. We will have to start well and then carry on. We have to click today. It looks a good track. Hopefully, if we restrict them to a modest total, we can chase it down. The bowling has been good but we will have to perform in all three departments to win the match. Hopefully, we come up with good plans today. We have one change with Razzak in for Gazi."Hafeez: "Well, we have seen in this tournament that every team is giving us a tough time. This is a knockout game, we have to play well. It is a good strip, we want to bat first. Then our spinners will use the conditions. The boys are very much ready. It is an important game. We have one change with Tanvir coming in for Bhatti. "Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batShakib: "We did not execute our plans. We did not play well as a team, especially with the bat. We did not do too many things right, the plan was to play sensibly rather than slogging. We have to be patient. There are still two more games to play. Hopefully, we do not repeat the mistakes.The crowd wanted us to qualify for Super 10s, we did that. They wanted us to play positive cricket, we have not done that. I am working hard obviously. I want to contribute both with the bat and ball. I am up for the challenge. I am focussed."Pitch report: "The pitch is showing signs of aging as the tournament progresses. The groundsmen are protecting the pitch, they have been watering the pitch. The spinners will get more assistance when they bowl in the second innings of the afternoon game", says Sanjay Manjrekar.Phew, aren't these permutations and combinations quite confusing? Irrespective of the mathematical scenarios, you can bet your bottom dollar that the crowd will turn up in huge numbers to belt out their encouragement for the home side. Toss and team details to follow shortly.Bangladesh though are yet to turn up for their own party. One of the major reasons for their downfall has been their reckless shot selection. The constant chopping and changing of personnel only reflects the imbalance in the setup. However, if Bangladesh manage to rediscover their spark today and pull off an upset, Australia, who square up against hitherto unbeaten India later in the night, will also stay alive. On the other hand, another surrender would see Bangladesh taking down pre-tournament favorites, Australia, along with them, even before the start of the second fixture of today's double-header.Pakistan have enjoyed the luxury of a 6-day break. Plenty has transpired since their thrilling win against Australia. India and South Africa have punched their tickets to the semis while England and Netherlands have been dumped out. A win against Bangladesh will ensure that Pakistan's fate rests in their own hands. If Hafeez's men get over the finish line today, then their clash with the defending champions, West Indies, will turn into a virtual quarterfinal.PreviewIt is now down to the business end of the T20 WC and only India are assured of a semi-final place in the ongoing tournament in Dhaka. In what is bound to be a fascinating contest between Pakistan and hosts Bangladesh, stakes will be high. Pakistan are in a close two-way race with the West Indies for a last-four slot from Group 2, while while Australia and Bangladesh, each with two losses from two games, also have an outside chance.However, for all these equations to come into play, Sunday's first game in Dhaka will be key. If Bangladesh lose tomorrow, there will be no home team, going into the last-four, which starts next week.Bangladesh: The Tigers are not the worst team in the world, and certainly not at home, where they have defeated some heavy weight teams before. But they have got off to a terrible start, losing heavily against the West Indies and group toppers India.For the sake of the passionate home fans, Mushfiqur Rahim's men will have to come back strongly against Pakistan, who themselves bounced back hard against Australia after a crushing opening defeat against arch-rivals India. It won't be easy for Bangladesh, though, despite a star-studded line-up with the likes of Tamim Iqbal, Rahim, Shakib al Hasan and Mashrafe Mortaza.But there is no denying that Bangladesh have the talent to upstage the best. They ran Pakistan real close in the recent Asia Cup and in the T20 format, no one team can go in as favourites anyway.Key Players: When you have power-packed players like Tamim, Rahim, Shakib and Mortaza, and do not do well enough consistently, your fans are bound to get dejected. But the problem with Bangladesh has been their overzealousness at times. Batsmen after batsmen got out, playing rank bad shots against India and that left the home fans with broken hearts. But their four best players need to come together and produce a stellar show for one last shot at glory.Pakistan: This is a team of glorious uncertainties. Soon after an abysmal opening game against India, Mohammad Hafeez's men routed a strong Australia and left them shell-shocked. They have some of the most talented T20 players in the side and on their day, any one or two of them can turn a game on its head.Pakistan were perhaps nervous against India and it seemed like nerves got the better of them. But they made amends against Australia and ensured they were still in the tournament, having opened their account.Key Players: There are so many of them. Shahid Afridi needs no introduction, neither does skipper Hafeez. Saeed Ajmal is the best off-spinner in the world and he can make that ball turn on almost any surface - and the Dhaka pitches have assisted spinners, so Bangladesh had better watch out.On a side note, do not forget, the heavy assault, Ajmal came under against the same Bangladesh batsmen he will be up against Sunday.Ground realities: Bangladesh and Pakistan have played each other only once in the Shere Bangla Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka, and the hosts ended up on the losing side.Stats:- Three Pakistan bowlers - Ajmal, Gul and Afridi feature in the top three list of wicket-takers in T20 internationals. While Ajmal has the most with 83, Gul has 77 and Afridi 75- Pakistan T20 captain Mohammad Hafeez has an impressive record in the shortest format. He has scored 1278 runs from 56 games and has hit seven fifties- Tamim Iqbal is Bangladesh's most successful batsman in T20 Internationals, with 678 runs from 33 matches.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Shamsur Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Nasir Hossain, Mahmudullah, Ziaur Rahman, Mashrafe Mortaza, Sohag Gazi, Al-Amin Hossain, Farhad Reza, Sabbir Rahman, Abdur Razzak, Mominul HaquePakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Mohammad Hafeez(c), Umar Akmal, Sohaib Maqsood, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Bilawal Bhatti, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Zulfiqar Babar, Sharjeel Khan, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Talha, Sohail TanvirLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
