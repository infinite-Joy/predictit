Johnson replaces Doherty in the team. All pace bowlers will love bowling here on this wicket. Our condolences go out to all the victims of the recent floods in Brisbane. We will donate the match fee and our shirts at the end of the match. Strauss: It is about time that we lost the toss. The wicket will not change much. We really played well in Adelaide and we will be looking to continue with the good form. Tremlett is out with a side strain and Woakes comes into the team. We are also doing our bit for the flood relief.Australia have won the toss and elected to batThere has been a lot of rain in Brisbane over the past couple of weeks. Although conditions are cloudy, the weather forecast for the day is good. It will be interesting what the captains of both teams do if they win the toss.Hello and Welcome to the 5th ODI between Australia and England at Brisbane. England are still alive in this series thanks to a fine hundred from Trott. The return of James Anderson into the England team has boosted their bowling department. Australia, on the other hand, are just one win away from sealing a series win. Shane Watson has been the mainstay of the Aussie top order and he will be the key for Australia once again.By Ganesh ChandrasekaranAs the action shifts to a city that is recovering from massive floods, England will be hoping for a similar recovery act on the field. They showed, in Adelaide, that they were not going to be knocked out in the first few rounds and that they were up for the fight. The Australian roll was stopped in it's tracks by man in form Jonathan Trott. He came up with a defiant hundred before knocking down a couple of the Aussies to ensure England stayed alive in the series.Australia, with one hand already on the trophy, will be looking to grab it at the earliest. They will be bolstered if Mitchell Johnson returns to the Gabba. Shane Watson has been the gamebreaker in this series and he will return to Brisbane, fully aware of his responsibility. He has admitted that the floods had taken his mind off cricket. This match will be a perfect setting for him to deliver again and bring some cheer back to the locals, who will always relish the Poms being beaten in any form of the game.With each game here on being a virtual knockout for England, it might be exactly what they needed, for they were displaying signs of complacency and tiredness. The team management will be under immense pressure to keep all the players in the right frame of mind just before the World Cup. The English are a rejuvenated side with the return of James Anderson and will be keen to take the positives of the previous game into this one. Going into Brisbane, England will be wrestling with the option of playing an extra seamer and that could mean that Michael Yardy may have to sit out.Both teams have their own share of worries. England desperately need Paul Collingwood to end his run drought and similarly Australia need Michael Clarke to get into some good rhythm with the bat even as he continues to lead the side efficiently in the absence of Ricky Ponting.Both teams have been doing their bit to help a flood ravaged town and it will be an emotional game for the Aussies in particular. With the game being a major source of funds for the flood relief, a packed house is expected and they will be eager to view a cracker of a contest. It promises to be one too with the series at stake.Numbers Game:1: There have been two day-night games between England and Australia at the Gabba and honours are even with each team winning one match.2: England have played 5 day-night games at the Gabba and have lost only once (Lost to Australia)What the players say:It'll be amazing. We were 3-0 down and to be able to fight to the end and turn out in Perth on what could be a final would be incredible. It was nice to win in Adelaide, you always look for momentum but momentum hasn't meant a lot on this trip so far. It's a different ground with different conditions and whoever adjusts best will win tomorrow. We can't afford to lose: Kevin Pietersen says its a do-or-die situation for England.I've said before the facts are there. My performances haven't been anywhere near as good as they need to be throughout this summer. I've felt like at times I've been hitting the ball pretty well but I haven't been able to go on and, not just get a big score or a hundred, but even get a 50 or a 70: Michael Clarke speaks about his poor run of form.Teams:Australia (From): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Shaun Marsh, Michael Clarke(c), Cameron White, David Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Shaun Tait, Doug Bollinger, Xavier DohertyEngland (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Matt Prior(w), Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan, Paul Collingwood, Chris Woakes, Ajmal Shahzad, Chris Tremlett, James Anderson, Michael Yardy, Tim Bresnan, Steve Davies, Steven Finn, James Tredwell, Luke WrightLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
