WEST INDIES:48.3 48.3Kyle Abbott to A Russell, SIX, Russell has done it! Take a bow, Russell! He launches the full delivery on the stumps, way over long-on. The white ball is into the sky and then as it lands, it's way over the ropes. Glum faces in the South African camp, while there is hugging, fist-pumping, encouragement and all sorts of stuff from the Windies
WEST INDIES:48.2 Kyle Abbott to A Russell, no run, cracker from Kyle Abbott. Comes back with a brilliant inswinger, floors Russell, the batsman did well, to dig it out back to the bowler, manages to keep his composure and gets the bat in even as Kyle Abbott throws the ball back at the stumps
WEST INDIES:48.1 Kyle Abbott to A Russell, FOUR, Russell you beauty! Sammy is pumping his fist. What a man! He flays a square drive, beating sweeper cover, too much timing on that and the Windies camp are pumped. How cool is this Russell?Kyle Abbott [9.0-1-52-0] is back into the attack
WEST INDIES:47.6 Phangiso to A Russell, leg byes, 1 run, great thinking from Cottrell, Russell gets forward and misses the flick, Cottrell though was up to it and showed good presence of mind to run a leg bye, called Russell through even as cover tried to run Russell out.

WEST INDIES:47.6 Phangiso to A Russell, wide, slips it down leg, pressure telling on Phangiso
WEST INDIES:47.5 Phangiso to A Russell, 2 runs, magnificent fielding from Miller at deep cover, it was hit hard and wide of him, he ran and then dives to his left to parry it back, keeps it to two, saved two. Will that prove crucial?
WEST INDIES:47.4 Phangiso to A Russell, SIX, Russell is turning it on! Down the track and to the pitch of the ball, before lofting it clean and high over long-on. Back-to-back sixes and that's fifty for Russell as well. Salutes the crowd and raises his bat. He is keeping his side in the game
WEST INDIES:47.3 Phangiso to A Russell, SIX, out of the ground! Phangiso drops it short, Russell went back and muscled it way over long-on. Into the trees. Takes some nerve to do that. The game is still on. Holder likes it and clapsWhat will Russell do now? Go for it, I suppose

Crazy stuff from West Indies. Brathwaite run out (de Villiers/van Wyk) 11(14) [6s-1]Phangiso to Brathwaite, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Aaron Phangiso [9.0-1-25-0] is back into the attack
WEST INDIES:46.6 Parnell to A Russell, no run, Parnell is reversing the ball away from Russell and beats him for the third time in a row. Replays show that the ball missed the bat too. The third ump didn't find any conclusive evidence to uphold the decision and the on-field call is overturned. No sound from the mic and also nothing on RTS.Russell has been given out! But he is reviewing it. Steve Davis gave it out as SA went up for a caught behind appeal. Russell is wondering what the fuss is all about. Shakes his head and reviews. No HotSpot. Nothing on Snicko. Replays show that the ball missed the bat by a distance. The naked eye was right. Steve Davis overturns his decision. Not out and Russell stays.
WEST INDIES:46.5 Parnell to A Russell, no run, so nearly hits off now! Russell made room and tried to cut that. The length wasn't there for the shot. Very nearly paid the price
WEST INDIES:46.4 Parnell to A Russell, no run, what a ball from Parnell. He has got this ball to move, late at pace. Once again Russell is beaten on the back foot defence. The angle made it look like a jaffa, but it was well past the edge and nowhere near taking the tiny feather. Russell wears a dead-pan expression on his faceChange of gloves for Russell. Bit of a breather as he takes time off to recollect his thoughts. Tense faces in the Windies camp.

They take the single too and Russell is now on strikeAB moves into a slip position
WEST INDIES:46.1 Parnell to Brathwaite, no run, Brathwaite is down but has played that well. Gets up and has a smile on his face. Short from Parnell and Brathwaite went down in trying to evade that. Parnell directed that at the batsmanWayne Parnell [9.0-0-46-1] is back into the attack

That is a big if though!

Sammy late on the defence, it skidded on and took the inside edge, missed the stumps and went to short fine legComing back to that run-out, the more one sees of it, the worse it looks. There was no run there. Samuels was partly to blame, but what was Carter thinking, only he knows. Perhaps the first ball of the over played on his mind, when he refused an easy single. But there can be no sympathy for the way he lost his wicket. Samuels rightly gave him an earful on the way back. Dreadful stuff from West Indies and the faces of Ambrose, Richardson tell a sorry tale

In the end the throw even though not collected properly by Duminy, he had all the time to whip the bails off. Carter gets a piece advice from Samuels on his way back. Shambolic stuff from Windies. J Carter run out (D Miller/Duminy) 5(13) [4s-1]Duminy to Samuels, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!What has Carter done? This is ridiculous running. Even school boys will play better than this. Carter is gone!

WEST INDIES:15.5 Behardien to Ramdin, out Lbw!! Behardien strikes and Ramdin walks off. That is plumb. Nipped back in and caught Ramdin on the back pad, beating the flick. Right in front of middle and an easy decision. Behardien celebrates by running around and leaping in joy. Samuels turned his back on Ramdin as soon as the umpire raised his finger.

Confusion between the batsmen, it was punched to the right of cover, the initial call was for 'wait, wait' but Leon Johnson was already halfway down, by the time he turned back, AB's dive and throw to van Wyk had caught him short, despite the dive. Great work from AB too. Leon Johnson run out (de Villiers/van Wyk) 18(40) [4s-2 6s-1]Phangiso to Leon Johnson, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Leon Johnson has run himself out? Yes he has.

Morkel was convinced and forced his captain to go for the review. Hits Smith on the back-leg, no inside edge, looks like the ball is heading down leg-side. It must smash into the stumps for the decision to be reversed. The impact is in front of leg-stump and it's going down leg-sideDwayne Smith and Gayle are at the crease. Dwayne Smith is on strike. M Morkel will open the attackWelcome back.. No Steyn today, Morne Morkel will open.. Two slips in placeMiller: 'Really excited, unbelievable feeling to get a hundred for your country. It's my first one and I will remember it forever. We were in trouble early on. It was slow and it got slower as it went on and the cutters will work really well when we bowl. Partnership with JP and we saved it well in the end. I have been working really hard in the last two years to rotate strike and I'm really chuffed. To be honest we were thinking 250. When Wayne [Parnell] came in, we were looking to get 240. Extended the partnership and we exploded in the end to get there.'West Indies let things drift in the middle overs and even though they had a very good powerplay, Miller timed his innings beautifully to get a ton and then unleashed a few big hits. It would've been painful for them had it not been for Miller facing just one ball in the final over. Still 262 on a slow PE wicket will take some getting and West Indies aren't in the best of nick with the bat at the moment. A fascinating second innings beckons us. Do stay tuned for the reply. We'll be back shortly. Before we go, here is Miller's interview.Everyone at PE are clapping and showing their appreciation for Miller. A couple of the West Indians - Sammy and Russell - come up to Miller and shake his hand. Nice to see. Miller soaks in the applause and waves his bat to all corners of PE. He has taken his side to a defendable total after the top-order failed. West Indies were much better in their opening burst today and the wicket had some life, which they exploited well to reduce the Proteas to 4 down for not many. Even AB had a rare failure and it was left to Miller and Duminy to do the repair job. They did just that as they looked to get their side back on track.4
SOUTH AFRICA:49.6 J Holder to D Miller, 2 runs, slower delivery and Miller skies it high, Holder wants a five-for, runs back and tries to get under that.

SOUTH AFRICA:48.2 A Russell to D Miller, FOUR, slower delivery, it sat up short to be hit and Miller controlled the pull to deep square leg, two bounces and over the ropes. Now Miller is going

Richie Richardson hands over the West Indies cap to debutant Sheldon Cottrell. The players are in a huddle now. Skipper Jason Holder has some words of encouragement for them. South African openers van Wyk and Rossouw are walking out to the middle.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Rilee Rossouw, Morne van Wyk(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Phangiso, Morne Morkel, Kyle AbbottWest Indies (Playing XI): Dwayne Smith, Chris Gayle, Leon Johnson, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Jonathan Carter, Andre Russell, Darren Sammy, Jason Holder(c), Carlos Brathwaite, Sheldon CottrellAB de Villiers will be playing; Amla, Steyn, Tahir, and Philander sit out for South Africa. They will be replaced by van Wyk, Abbott, Phangiso, and Parnell. Three changes for West Indies - Sammy, Cottrell, Johnson replace Benn, Taylor, and Deonarine.West Indies have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe series is already done and dusted. In the two matches that remain, the only option West Indies have is of regaining lost pride. Their batsmen have been inconsistent while there seems to be no depth in their bowling. They have got wickets but at a huge price. This is not a situation they would want to be just three weeks before the World Cup. On the other hand, South Africa look at ease. Dale Steyn has been rested and Kyle Abbott is expected to take his place. Morne van Wyk will be opening in the absence of Amla and will keep wickets as well. Even skipper AB de Villiers might be taking a break. Hello and welcome to the fourth ODI between South Africa and West Indies being played at Port Elizabeth. Join us in a short while as we bring you the toss and team updates...After a successful T20I series, West Indies were expected to perform better against the hosts. But in three ODIs, they have been ruthlessly mauled by the Proteas. In the rain-affected first ODI, South Africa won by 61 runs, the second match was an altogether different story - with AB de Villiers methodically destroying the opposition with the fastest ODI ton ever. Opting to bat first in the third game, did nothing to bring about a change in the visitor's fortunes. They collapsed miserably posting a meagre 122 on the board.Preview:Three weeks before the first ball of the ICC Cricket World Cup, 2015 is bowled, South Africa and West Indies are placed at opposite sides of the spectrum. The Proteas are riding on a wave of good form and have looked unbeatable at times. On the other hand, West Indies have looked a pale shadow of their mighty past. Having jettisoned Dywane Bravo and Kieron Pollard, the visitors' faith in their young talents hasn't been rewarded as yet.South AfricaThe series has been wrapped up and with just two more matches to go before the game's premier tournament, it's time for the hosts to make use of the opportunity to experiment. Coach, Russell Domingo, has already promised changes in the batting line-up with JP Duminy likely to go up in the batting order. The matches in Port Elizabeth and Centurion will also give the hosts' one final chance to arrive at their best combination. The hosts are certain to make some changes with Dale Steyn rested for the remainder of the ODI series. Opening batsman Hashim Amla will also not feature in Port Elizabeth, but will return for the Centurion ODI. AB de Villiers, the skipper, is expected to take a break for the last game. In the absence of Amla, Morne van Wyk will open the batting and also keep wickets.West IndiesWhile the hosts look well-settled, the visiting West Indies' unit has been caught up in a myriad of problems. Their batsmen have failed and the bowlers have been reduced to being mere spectators in front of a rampaging opposition. Stats reveal mediocre numbers with only opener, Dwayne Smith and wicket-keeper batsman, Denesh Ramdin, coming close to the 100-run mark. Chris Gayle, who was impressive in the T20Is has been a major disappointment, having managed only 61 runs from his three visits to the middle. If the batsmen have failed, less said the better about the bowlers. With three wickets, Andre Russell, has been the pick, but his wickets have come at a price. The visitors have picked up a grand sum of 11 wickets in the three matches so far, and those numbers reflect their inability to keep a tight leash on the South African batsmen.Team News: Now, van Wyk has been confirmed as a starter and will also keep wickets. Kyle Abbott is likely to replace the rested Dale Steyn. Having tried all possible combinations, it's time for the West Indies to decide upon their best side ahead of the World Cup.Quotes:"Yes, we've won three in a row but the challenge for us will be to go four-nil, five-nil up and put ourselves under that sort of pressure and to take that into the World Cup" - JP Duminy said that South Africa will look to complete the whitewash."I am worried about the way we are going about our cricket. I think we can be a lot more respectable and put up our hands sometimes when we make errors"- Jason Holder reflected on his team's miserable performance in the first three ODIs.Teams:West Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Marlon Samuels, Narsingh Deonarine, Denesh Ramdin(w), Jonathan Carter, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Sulieman Benn, Jerome Taylor, Carlos Brathwaite, Leon Johnson, Lendl Simmons, Sheldon CottrellSouth Africa (From): Rilee Rossouw, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c/w), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Vernon Philander, Wayne Parnell, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Aaron Phangiso, Kyle Abbott, Morne van WykLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
