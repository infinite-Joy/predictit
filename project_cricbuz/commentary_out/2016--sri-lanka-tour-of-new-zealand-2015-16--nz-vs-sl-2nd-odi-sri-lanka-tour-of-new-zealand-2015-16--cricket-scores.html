Dushmantha Chameera will open the attackThe Black Caps got off to a blazing start last time around but this time they will open without Brendon McCullum. Chameera has the ball in his hand. Here we go...One would have hoped for the Sri Lankans to learn from their mistakes in the previous game, but they have been very poor with the bat once again. They started off positively but lost three wickets in quick succession. Chandimal and Mathews hung around for just a little while, before they both got out in the space of 8 balls. In fact, the highest individual score for Sri Lanka belongs to Kulasekara, whose score of 19 at least took the visitors past the total of 100. While Henry picked 4 wickets, McClenaghan finished with 3. It should be another straightforward chase for the Black Caps. Join us in just a short while to catch all the action from that innings.2

A strangle down the leg-side, McClenaghan continued bowling short and on Mathews's body, his strategy has reaped rewards. Mathews was looking to glance it after shuffling slightly across, but the ball got big on him and it catches the glove, brushes the jersey on its way to the keeper.

SRI LANKA:13.4 Doug Bracewell to Chandimal, out Lbw!! Another one bites the dust. Chandimal, the latest entrant in the casualty list. Bracewell was getting the ball to shape back in and that's been the undoing for Chandimal. He comes across to this length delivery shaping back in on middle stump and fails to work it away, wears it on the pad and the umpire's finger went up in a flash. That looked plumb to the naked eye. Chandimal discusses the option of a review with his skipper, but decides not to take it. Hawk-Eye shows that the ball would have crashed into middle and leg.

Here we go then...Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Danushka Gunathilaka, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Dushmantha Chameera, Jeffrey VandersayNew Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Ross Taylor, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Doug Bracewell, Ish Sodhi, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghanSo, New Zealand have made just one change - Ish Sodhi replaces Adam Milne in the side. For Sri Lanka, Jeffrey Vandersay makes his ODI debut and Sachithra Senanayake too returns to the team, Lakmal and Mendis miss out.Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batKane Williamson missed the last match with a knee niggle and the way New Zealand performed with the bat, they will surely not hurry him into the team. But, if he has recovered completely, Tom Latham might lose his place to accommodate the Kiwi vice-captain. Will Sri Lanka make a few changes too? Stay tuned for the toss to find out.Angelo Mathews's men showed some fight when Milinda Siriwardana and Nuwan Kulasekara added 98 runs together for the seventh wicket, helping the Lankans finish with 189. However. the Black Caps made a mockery of that total, chasing it down in just 21 overs, with Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill going gung-ho right from the very start. New Zealand, who have rested the duo of Southee and Boult for this series, hardly missed their strike bowlers as Matt Henry picked four wickets while Doug Bracewell snaffled three. They were well supported by the other two pacers as well.Battered and bruised, that's how the Sri Lankans must have felt like after the end of the first ODI. After losing the 2-match Test series 2-0, the Lankans were thrashed by the Kiwis in the first ODI. The situation was so dire for the visitors that they were reeling at 27/5 even before the 10th over got completed. Today, Sri Lanka will be hoping to put all that behind them and start afresh. Hello and a warm welcome to the second ODI between New Zealand and Sri Lanka.Preview:Coming at the back of a comprehensive win, New Zealand will look to stamp their authority over the battered Sri Lankan side in the second One-Day International (ODI) at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Monday (December 28). Having beaten Sri Lanka in all their matches in the ongoing tour, the hosts are only growing dominant with each passing match and look send to extend their dominance.Sri Lanka's 50-over set-up isn't devoid of experience with the likes of Tillakaratne Dilshan, Ajantha Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara and Chamara Kapugedera in the side - players who didn't feature in Tests. It counted for little as within the first 10 overs, half their side was back in the pavilion. Milinda Siriwardana andNuwan Kulasekara slammed half-centuries, but the target of 189 proved too little and too easy for the hosts as they romped home to a seven-wicket win, with 29 overs to spare.It is unlikely that New Zealand will hurry Kane Williamson, who is suffering a knee niggle, into the side. Martin Guptill, the New Zealand opener, isn't complaining about that. He is currently the highest run-getter in ODIs this year, having wrestled the position from Williamson in the previous match. "I think I've played the most games out of anyone in the world so I'd hope to be at the top of that list," Guptill said with a sheepish grin.Having been in and out of the side for long before the start of 2014, Guptill said, "I think you go through periods in your career where you're not so confident with how you're going. The start of last summer was one of those times. You have those periods where things don't quite go your way and everything you try doesn't seem to work."Even in the absence of their best batsmen and new-ball pair of Tim Southee and Trent Boult, the hosts have a strong playing XI to field. For Sri Lanka, the form of Kulasekara and Ajantha Mendis will be crucial. They might be tempted to boost their batting by including Thisara Perera.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Danushka Gunathilaka, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal(w), Angelo Mathews(c), Milinda Siriwardana, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Ajantha Mendis, Dushmantha Chameera, Suranga Lakmal, Sachithra Senanayake, Jeffrey Vandersay, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Pradeep, Kithuruwan VithanageNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Ross Taylor, Henry Nicholls, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Doug Bracewell, Adam Milne, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan, Ish Sodhi, George Worker, Tim SoutheeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
