Dinesh Karthik is on strike. Kyle Mills will open the attackGary Kirsten: Maybe the media has realized that they may not get much more out of me. At the end of the day, it is all about the players and what they perform on the field. As we move towards the WC, we have to play the big games better. If we have to win the big prize, we need to create the big plays and grab the moment. We have to shift the momentum and transfer the pressure so that we can be worthy contenders in big tournaments.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, BJ Watling, Ross Taylor(c), Kane Williamson, Scott Styris, Grant Elliott, Gareth Hopkins(w), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Andy McKay, Tim SoutheeIndia (Playing XI): Dinesh Karthik, Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Ashish Nehra, Munaf PatelTaylor: We have to pick up quick wickets and put India under pressure. Jacob Oram's injury flared up and so he has gone back home. Daryl Tuffey was not feeling well and so he sits out for the match. Andy McKay and Tim Southee come into the team.Dhoni: More often than not, we are in a position where we have to win. Munaf comes in place of Pragyan Ojha and Virat Kohli comes in place of Rohit Sharma.India have won the toss and elected to batWeather update: There was a slight drizzle some time back. The covers were on the pitch. However, they have come off and it is sunny in Dambulla.Pitch Report: Danny Morrison says that this is a brand new surface. There are some tinges of grass which are spread out evenly. The pitch is hard and that will assist the pace and the bounce. Russell Arnold says that partnerships are the key and also the batsmen should be patient. This is probably the best batting track in this stadium. On this same pitch, Pakistan made 385 against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup, with Afridi scoring a brilliant century.Arun Lal reckons that the Indian team should explore its options. They should try out Ashwin, Saurabh Tiwary, Kohli and Munaf Patel. The key is to hang in there and play out the first 10 overs carefully. They can play seven batsmen in the squad but it is not the way forward. If the team wins the toss, they should bat first.Hello and Welcome to this virtual semi-final clash between India and New Zealand at Dambulla. The equation is clear: India win and they go to the finals, India lose and they go home. The same holds true even for the Kiwis. The Indians will have to pull up their socks following their thrashing at the hands of the Lankans in the previous match. NZ, on the other hand, will look to overcome their injury worries and secure a place in the final. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.....Teams:India (From): Dinesh Karthik, Virender Sehwag, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Pragyan Ojha, Ashish Nehra, Abhimanyu Mithun, Ravichandran Ashwin, Virat Kohli, Saurabh TiwaryNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, BJ Watling, Ross Taylor(c), Peter Ingram, Scott Styris, Jacob Oram, Gareth Hopkins(w), Nathan McCullum, Daryl Tuffey, Kyle Mills, Andy McKay, Kane Williamson, Grant Elliott, Tim Southee, Jeetan PatelLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
