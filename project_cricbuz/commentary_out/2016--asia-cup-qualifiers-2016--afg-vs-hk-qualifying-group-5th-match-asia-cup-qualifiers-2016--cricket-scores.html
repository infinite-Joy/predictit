HONG KONG:17.1 17.1Dawlat Zadran to Tanveer Ahmed, out Lbw!! That's it. Afghanistan survive in the competition with a 66-run win thumping. They are now at the mercy of the next game to follow to see if they make it through to the main competition. The ball pitched on middle and straightened off the pitch, hurried through and rapped Tanveer plumb in front. Tanveer Ahmed lbw b Dawlat Zadran 0(2)Dawlat Zadran to Tanveer Ahmed, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
HONG KONG:16.6 Rashid Khan to Adil Mehmood, no run, yes, you got it right. Another wrong'on in this googly-barrage of an over. Down the leg-side and Adil perhaps read it but failed to glance it fineAdil Mehmood, right handed bat, comes to the crease
HONG KONG:16.5 Rashid Khan to Nadeem Ahmed, out Lbw!! and the ninth wicket is down. The googly's working like a charm. Gets it to rip in from a length, Nadeem has no clue. As blank as a boy in a Barbie shop. Is hit on the bent back pad and the umpire hurriedly points his finger to the heaven. Nadeem Ahmed lbw b Rashid Khan 2(5)Rashid Khan to Nadeem Ahmed, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
HONG KONG:16.4 Rashid Khan to Tanveer Ahmed, leg byes, 1 run, loud appeal, googly turning in to strike the front pad but the impact's well outside off
HONG KONG:16.3 Rashid Khan to Nadeem Ahmed, 1 run, this tossed up delivery is nudged to mid wicketTanveer Ahmed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
HONG KONG:16.2 Rashid Khan to Nadeem Ahmed, out Christopher Carter Run Out!! Horror that's followed by suspense and comedy. About the perfect script for a box office success. The ball was glided to short third man and Nadeem did take a few steps out of his crease to intend a run.No signal to his partner while he was ball-watching and Christopher Carter was right at the striker's end. Rashid Khan collects the throw, waits forever with a grin while staring at the batsmen and then takes the bails off in dramatic fashion. Christopher Carter run out (Shapoor/Rashid Khan) 2(4)Rashid Khan to Nadeem Ahmed, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
HONG KONG:16.1 Rashid Khan to Nadeem Ahmed, no run, quick on the pads, Nadeem misses the tickle and the ball pads away fine for the keeper to cut it offHong Kong need 69 runs in 24 balls
HONG KONG:15.6 Dawlat Zadran to Nadeem Ahmed, 1 run, fuller length delivery, Ahmed squeezes it through cover and retains the strike with that run
HONG KONG:15.5 Dawlat Zadran to Christopher Carter, 1 run, fullish, Carter hoicks it, manages to drag it off the inside half to long-onNadeem Ahmed, right handed bat, comes to the crease
HONG KONG:15.4 Dawlat Zadran to Aizaz Khan, out Caught by Stanikzai!! It looked like a conglomeration of three fielders but Stanikzai called for it and pouched it running across from mid-on. Just a length ball and Aizaz was trying to sell it down the river for a price too high. Lofts, wanted to go straight on but ends up slicing it high and over mid-off to perish. Aizaz Khan c Stanikzai b Dawlat Zadran 2(6)Dawlat Zadran to Aizaz Khan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
HONG KONG:15.3 Dawlat Zadran to Aizaz Khan, no run, opens the blade and guides it to cover-point
HONG KONG:15.2 Dawlat Zadran to Aizaz Khan, 2 runs, slower delivery again and this held on the pitch. Aizaz jabbed forward with a straight forward bat and ended up spooning it uppishly just over extra cover
HONG KONG:15.1 Dawlat Zadran to Christopher Carter, 1 run, slowish outside off, Christopher inside-edges the defence on his left boot, the ball ricochets towards point and there's a quick single effectedDawlat Zadran [2.0-0-13-0] is back into the attack
HONG KONG:14.6 Rashid Khan to Aizaz Khan, no run, dragged down, Aizaz goes for the cross-batted swing but the ball makes its way under the bat
HONG KONG:14.5 Rashid Khan to Aizaz Khan, no run, gentle legbreak that turned about quarter as much as his googly. Aizaz is cramped and just about manages to lay some pad on it and guide it towards backward point
HONG KONG:14.4 Rashid Khan to Christopher Carter, leg byes, 1 run, very slow again and gets the googly to turn in big. Christopher is foxed, adjusts but not enough. Ball takes the pad and runs into the on-side
HONG KONG:14.3 Rashid Khan to Christopher Carter, no run, a wrong'un that turned a touch more and hit him on the back leg. Would have gone down legChristopher Carter, right handed bat, comes to the crease
HONG KONG:14.2 Rashid Khan to Anshy Rath, out Stumped!! Anshy Rath falls and but for any surprises ahead, Afghanistan should be able to tighten the noose now. Bowled teasingly slow, Anshuman came dancing forward. Ball gripped, turned, made way between the bat-pad plughole and is stumped in an eye-wink. Anshy Rath st Mohammad Shahzad b Rashid Khan 41(38) [4s-5]Rashid Khan to Anshy Rath, THAT'S OUT!! Stumped!!
HONG KONG:14.1 Rashid Khan to Anshy Rath, 2 runs, this one's tossed up and Anshuman lofts it over extra cover for a braceRashid Khan [1.0-0-7-0] is back into the attack

HONG KONG:13.5 Nabi to T Afzal, out Caught by Naib!! And he perishes now to hand out Nabi his fourth wicket. Ball was flat and fullish, Tanwir wanted to swat it across the line. Ekes out a top-edge that that funnily skies towards long-on. Imagine the wood on that bat. Taken comfortably, beating the Dhaka's night sky vision. T Afzal c Naib b Nabi 4(5)Nabi to T Afzal, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
HONG KONG:13.4 Nabi to T Afzal, 2 runs, comes down the track and lofts it over mid-wicket, would have hoped to clear the fences but it wasn't wooded off the middle. Mistimed and it falls short of an on-rushing deep mid-wicket fielder
HONG KONG:13.3 Nabi to Anshy Rath, 1 run, worked to short mid wicket for a very quick single
HONG KONG:13.2 Nabi to T Afzal, 1 run, taps this to short cover and runs. The fielder swoops in, collects, turns around and fires the throw at the bowler's end. If that had hit, Anshy Rath would have been walking back
HONG KONG:13.1 Nabi to Anshy Rath, 1 run, worked off the pads to mid wicket to invite a throw that looped up
HONG KONG:12.6 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, leg byes, 1 run, nothing's pitched up. Back of a length, Anshuman looks to hoick it. Misses and the ball lobs off the pads and falls just short of square leg
HONG KONG:12.5 Shapoor to T Afzal, 1 run, short of length delivery, Afzal protracts his hands and glides the ball to third man for a single to get off the mark
HONG KONG:12.4 Shapoor to T Afzal, no run, the skull-seeker. Zooms off the pitch and Tanwir had to bend his back to arch away from the lineTanwir Afzal, right handed bat, comes to the crease
HONG KONG:12.3 Shapoor to Nizakat Khan, out Caught by Mohammad Shahzad!! Once is luck, twice coincidence and thrice a folly. After two befuddling beating on the last two balls, Nizakat wanted to steer this shortish ball to third man. Was beaten by the pace whilst being cramped with that in-ducker. Off the top-edge and to the keeper. The umpire raised his finger belatedly, after Shapoor had his arms wide to celebrate it. Nizakat Khan c Mohammad Shahzad b Shapoor 1(4)Shapoor to Nizakat Khan, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
HONG KONG:12.2 Shapoor to Nizakat Khan, no run, and another ripper. How do I put that? This delivery on a good length picthed and snaked away just enough to beat Nizakat's third man steer
HONG KONG:12.1 Shapoor to Nizakat Khan, no run, beaten! And that invites a slip too. Back of a length and zipping away outside off, Nizakat pokes and ends up looking silly84 runs of 48 deliveries. Can Hong Kong palindrome their way to a win?
HONG KONG:11.6 Nabi to Anshy Rath, 2 runs, flat and full, Anshuman turns it through mid wicket for a brace
HONG KONG:11.5 Nabi to Anshy Rath, no run, good shout. The ball vroomed in with the angle, struck Anshuman high on the pad as he missed his leg-side working. High, loud appeal but not given
HONG KONG:11.4 Nabi to Anshy Rath, FOUR, picks this flatter delivery and tonks it over Nabi's head with a full-blooded bat swing. Long-on runs across but ends up jogging formally
HONG KONG:11.3 Nabi to Nizakat Khan, 1 run, went with the angle and Nizakat's clip eked out a leading edge to short third man
HONG KONG:11.2 Nabi to Anshy Rath, 1 run, drifting in of off, Anshuman nurdles it to long-onNizakat Khan, right handed bat, comes to the crease
HONG KONG:11.1 Nabi to Chapman, out Caught by Naib!! Slung in outside off, Chapman shimmies out of his crease and lofts it. Intention was to go over the roped but couldn't thrust the power into the shot. Hit it down long-off's throat who bids Chapman goodbye with a comfortable catch. Nabi is on a hat-trick! Chapman c Naib b Nabi 2(3)Nabi to Chapman, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
HONG KONG:10.6 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, no run, stays back and pats this short of length delivery outside off to point

HONG KONG:10.4 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, 1 run, hops inside his crease to account for Shapoor's shoulders and clips it to backward square leg
HONG KONG:10.3 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, FOUR, length ball absolutely speared into the pads, Anshuman shuffled across, arguably a bit too much, managed to get some bat on the tickle and the ball runs fine all the way
HONG KONG:10.2 Shapoor to Chapman, 1 run, a late dab to third man basically. Beat the short third man's sporting dive on its way
HONG KONG:10.1 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, 1 run, back of a length delivery angled in on the pads, a turn-and-tuck to backward square leg for a singleShapoor Zadran [1.0-0-12-0] is back into the attackMark Chapman, left handed bat, comes to the creas
HONG KONG:9.6 Nabi to Hayat, out Caught by Shenwari!! This is a very, very good catch. Not the best day for Afghanistan in the field but this makes up for it. Swept uppishly, middles it despite fetching it from outside off, Shenwari runs in from deep mid-wicket and dives his way into the catch. Hayat c Shenwari b Nabi 18(16) [4s-2 6s-1]Nabi to Hayat, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
HONG KONG:9.5 Nabi to Anshy Rath, 1 run, milked off the pads to mid-on and there's another quick single. Sigh and bravo to balance things up
HONG KONG:9.4 Nabi to Hayat, 1 run, not so short but the deep occupancy of the crease allows him to pull. To long-on where the fielder was wrong-footed but recovered to let out a sharp throw. Only a single
HONG KONG:9.3 Nabi to Hayat, no run, tossed up this time, Babar swipes it to mid-wicket
HONG KONG:9.2 Nabi to Hayat, no run, flatter outside off, Babar forces it back with feet in cement blocks

HONG KONG:8.6 Rashid Khan to Hayat, no run, slowish googly outside off, Hayat looks to drive but gets an inside edge on his back boot. Could as well have gone onto the stumps
HONG KONG:8.5 Rashid Khan to Hayat, SIX, that's smashed. That's what you would do if you spotted something that juicy. Dragged down, Hayat stood tall and could choose the spot. Picks the area over deep mid-wicket and enjoys the parasail
HONG KONG:8.4 Rashid Khan to Anshy Rath, 1 run, nudged to short mid-wicket for a sharp single
HONG KONG:8.3 Rashid Khan to Anshy Rath, no run, flipper that follows Anshuman outside leg, Anshuman adjusts quickly but not enough. Rapped on pad but it's high and outside leg-stump
HONG KONG:8.2 Rashid Khan to Hayat, leg byes, 1 run, googly second ball, Babar read it seemingly but missed the clip. Ball takes the pad and rolls to short mid-wicket where Rashid Khan runs across and cuts it off. Attempts a direct hit at the bowler's end too but Hayat was in
HONG KONG:8.1 Rashid Khan to Hayat, no run, ouch. Dragged down alright, Babar pulls and pulls it on his left bootRashid Khan, right-arm leg break, comes into the attack
HONG KONG:7.6 Naib to Hayat, 1 run, to the same fielder to rub in some salt and this drive is kept to a single
HONG KONG:7.5 Naib to Hayat, FOUR, and that's burst through. Full ball mistimed off the toe-end, goes flat and perhaps falls just in front of long-off. The fielder dived in front but couldn't get his body behind the ball. Lets it through and it runs away
HONG KONG:7.4 Naib to Hayat, 2 runs, another serving of with, Babar this time upper-cuts instead of a glide and steals a couple to third man
HONG KONG:7.3 Naib to Hayat, no run, ah, close! Guides it to backward point and hurries through. Anshy Rath was late to respond and was safe thanks to the direct hit that bounced over the stumps
HONG KONG:7.2 Naib to Hayat, FOUR, that shot was so good that it beat a Superman-like one-handed dive at cover. Gets a full delivery outside off, Babar puts his all in the drive and bullets it away
HONG KONG:7.1 Naib to Anshy Rath, 1 run, full and straight from over the wicket, kindly nudged to deep mid-wicket

HONG KONG:6.3 Nabi to KD Shah, out Lbw!! There's the breakthrough. No turn at all as Kinchit looked for the room the cut. Ball just hurried back in with the arm and beat the cut shot to rap the pad. An appeal and a raised-finger farewell for Kinchit Shah. HawkEye shows that the ball was clipping the leg-stump spigot. KD Shah lbw b Nabi 29(19) [4s-5 6s-1]Nabi to KD Shah, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
HONG KONG:6.2 Nabi to KD Shah, no run, tame appeal. Arrowing in with the arm, Kinchit sweeps and it stays there, rolling off his pad and onto the ground
HONG KONG:6.1 Nabi to Anshy Rath, 1 run, well run. Nudges this to short fine leg and runs for his lifeMohammad Nabi, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
HONG KONG:5.6 Naib to KD Shah, no run, length ball down leg, Kinchit turns around to connect the whatever, missed and the ball brushed the pad to deny him a wide
HONG KONG:5.5 Naib to KD Shah, FOUR, and another! Looks to flay it through covers but gets an outside edge that scoots wide of the keeper to the third man fence
HONG KONG:5.4 Naib to KD Shah, FOUR, here's the 50-run mark for Hong Kong. And helps his team get there with an audacious hook shot. Fetches it dangerously from outside off, closes his eye and swivels into the shot. Fine and over fine leg
HONG KONG:5.3 Naib to Anshy Rath, leg byes, 1 run, every bowler now knows the mantra. Follow the batsman. Length ball targetting a shuffling-away Anshuman, is cramped and the ball takes the pads to roll into the off-side
HONG KONG:5.2 Naib to Anshy Rath, 2 runs, veering down leg, Anshuman changes its trajectory with a wristy push to deep mid-wicket
HONG KONG:5.1 Naib to Anshy Rath, 2 runs, bends forward, clips it off the pads and hurries back in for the secondGulbadin Naib, right-arm medium, comes into the attackSay what you may but this is a blockbuster start from a team yet to register a win...
HONG KONG:4.6 Sadiq to KD Shah, SIX, gets low, lets the back pad embrace the pitch and slog-sweeps it over deep mid-wicket. You knew it was a maximum rightaway. Yes, that sound. That willow-leather sound
HONG KONG:4.5 Sadiq to Anshy Rath, 1 run, another one that darts in, Anshuman is cramped and runs it down to short fine off the gloves
HONG KONG:4.4 Sadiq to Anshy Rath, no run, no turn but a tad more bounce on this, Anshuman looked to cut, got a top-edge that runs through the vacant cordon

HONG KONG:4.1 Sadiq to Anshy Rath, no run, slider on off, hurries in and there's an appeal for LBW. Off the pad and to cover-point

HONG KONG:3.5 Dawlat Zadran to KD Shah, no run, swooooosh! A might bent-knee tonk attempted over mid-wicket but the ball moves away to defeat the shot
HONG KONG:3.4 Dawlat Zadran to KD Shah, no run, on a good length outside off, Kinchit opens the face of the bat in defence
HONG KONG:3.3 Dawlat Zadran to KD Shah, FOUR, the Hong Kong Airlines has taken off. Slower short ball from back of the hand, Kinchit in a pull-loop..well pulls, gets a top-edge that runs through over the keeper
HONG KONG:3.2 Dawlat Zadran to KD Shah, FOUR, all inspired by the last ball's half-success, another short ball but the radar's horribly down leg. Kinchit swivels and helps the mediocrity on that with a pull through fine leg
HONG KONG:3.2 Dawlat Zadran to KD Shah, wide, that's the Dhaka suspense. Short ball zooming over and beating the pull. In all fairness, Kinchit had invited it with an aggressive shimmy
HONG KONG:3.1 Dawlat Zadran to Anshy Rath, 1 run, full delivery on leg-stump, Anshuman backed away to get behind it and smashed it to mid-on with a flat bat
HONG KONG:2.6 Sadiq to KD Shah, no run, a harmless edge as Kinchit attmepts to drive this flighted delivery. Takes the outside half of the bat and rolls to backward point

HONG KONG:2.4 Sadiq to KD Shah, no run, fired in outside off, Kinchit presents a straight bat face and blocks it out
HONG KONG:2.3 Sadiq to KD Shah, no run, skips out and bunts this flatter delivery back
HONG KONG:2.2 Sadiq to KD Shah, no run, quicker outside off, Shah opens the blade and eases the defence
HONG KONG:2.1 Sadiq to KD Shah, FOUR, that's a harsh hello. Welcomes him with a kneel down and lofts it deliciously over extra cover for a one-bounce fourKarim Sadiq, right-arm off break, comes into the attack
HONG KONG:1.6 Dawlat Zadran to Anshy Rath, no run, opens the face of the bat and pushes this length ball square of the wicket on the off-side
HONG KONG:1.5 Dawlat Zadran to Anshy Rath, leg byes, FOUR, butterfingers and misplaced radar at Mirpur today. Missed tuck shot as this length ball rapped on the pads, loud appeal denied because it pitched outside leg. A throw from cover-point that misses the stumps and runs through to the boundary. Hectic
HONG KONG:1.4 Dawlat Zadran to Anshy Rath, no run, width on offer and Anshuman's cut can only go as far as point
HONG KONG:1.3 Dawlat Zadran to Anshy Rath, no run, fullish delivery just outside off, Rath presents a straight blade and slightly closes it on impact to punch the ball to mid-on
HONG KONG:1.2 Dawlat Zadran to Anshy Rath, no run, stands taller in his crease and punches the defence back to Dawlat Zadran
HONG KONG:1.1 Dawlat Zadran to KD Shah, 3 runs, Nabi gave it a chase from the infield and hauled it just inside the sweeper cover ropes with a slight help from the outfield. Slight fumble as the ball slips out while throwing back and there's a third run off this mistimed loftDawlat Zadran, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
HONG KONG:0.6 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, FOUR, oh Mirpur! The pitch ate all the venom on this outside edge and it bounced well in front of the slip. Length delivery nipping away, Anshuman perhaps wanted to steer it fine, eked out an edge that runs through between a diving keper and the lone slipper
HONG KONG:0.5 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, FOUR, this is an excellent comeback. Full and moving away, Anshuman stands firm and carasses the drive through extra cover
HONG KONG:0.4 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, FOUR, some deliveries are born with a poor destiny. Like a short and wide ball that's just been cut uppishly wide of the backward point
HONG KONG:0.3 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, no run, back of a length delivery that scissors back in, Anshuman poked at it, perhaps covered for it too much and sees the ball whistle past the outside edge
HONG KONG:0.2 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, no run, gets it a touch fuller and Anshuman this time is forward to cover for the outswing and defends it to cover
HONG KONG:0.1 Shapoor to Anshy Rath, no run, beaten! Banged in on a length and moving away in the air, Anshuman plants his front leg and swings for the drive. MissesAnshy Rath and KD Shah are at the crease. Anshy Rath is on strike. Shapoor will open the attackThe openers walk out under murky skies and artificial lights have been switched on to keep the cricket in continuum. Shapoor Zadran has the ball, one slip in place. Will Afghanistan defend this and keep the hop-balloon intact? Here we go..Well! If Hong Kong loses this game - All those overthrows, dropped catches and missed run-out chances might come back to haunt them. After Mohammad Shahzad set the tone at the top, Stanikzai followed it up with a 35-ball 49 and Najibullah Zadran played the finisher role. He walloped 60 runs in 35 balls bringing his maiden fifty while at it. The lesser we speak about Hong Kong's fielding the better... The chase demands some intent, aggression and smartness. Do Hong Kong have it? We'll get to know in a little while....1

Dawlat Zadran was half-way down the pitch and in fact was committed for the single. Najibullah Zadran didn't move an inch. The fielder runs along with the ball and just flicks a bail at the bowler's end. Dawlat Zadran run out (T Afzal) 13(4) [6s-2]Tanveer Ahmed to Najibullah, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!
