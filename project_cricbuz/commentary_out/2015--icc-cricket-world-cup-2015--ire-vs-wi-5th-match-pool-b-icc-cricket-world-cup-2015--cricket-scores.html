IRELAND:45.5 45.5Jerome Taylor to J Mooney, FOUR, That's it! It was Pakistan in 2007, England in 2011 and now it's West Indies in 2015. Ireland become the first team to successfully chase down a total in this World Cup. This is the fifth time in World Cup history that a target in excess of 300 has been achieved and Ireland have three of those to their credit.

IRELAND:44.3 Roach to N O'Brien, FOUR, that's an authoritative shot. Full and outside off stump, O'Brien drives well over extra-cover and it rockets to the boundary. He's doing it easily
IRELAND:44.2 Roach to N O'Brien, FOUR, friendly ball and O'Brien helps himself to a boundary. Down the leg side, a fine little tickle takes it to the fine leg boundaryJohn Mooney, left handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:44.1 Roach to N O'Brien, out K O'Brien Run Out!! 1 run completed. The younger brother is late to respond for the second run and he's run-out for a duck. Slower ball wide outside off stump, Niall drives it to deep point, Smith runs to his right and fires an accurate throw adjacent to the stumps at the bowler's end. Roach stays calm and whips the bails off before Kevin made his ground. K O'Brien run out (Dwayne Smith/Roach) 0(1)Roach to N O'Brien, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Run-out check has been sent upstairs.

IRELAND:38.1 J Holder to N O'Brien, FOUR, 13th ODI fifty, this has come off just 38 balls and what a hand he's played. Full and in the slot, this is unacceptable from West Indies. After scoring a hundred, Simmons said in the innings break that the slower balls aren't stopping on the batsman, the West Indies bowlers seem to have misread the pitch. They continue to take pace off the ball and bowl full, a set batsman like O'Brien doesn't miss out on those juicy balls and he muscles it over mid-off and it's almost a maximumEleven runs off the over and the equation is down to just 50 runs needed off 72 balls.

J Holder will open the attackWelcome back.. Ireland had the match in their grasp before they let Simmons and Sammy take it away from them. However, they still have a chance to make a match of it. Porterfield on strike. Holder has two slips in place...The momentum is with West Indies. It will be interesting to see Ireland's approach with the bat. Take a break and join us back in a while.Simmons: "It was a good innings, I feel good about myself. We needed that partnership, it didn't happen early on, but me and Sammy batted well and we put on a partnership. It's a good batting wicket, the slower ball hasn't been stopping and is sliding. It's a new role for me, batting lower down the order, normally I am an opening batsman, but I accept the challenge. We have better swing bowlers and hopefully they can utilise the pitch."Sammy was struggling with his back but he hit 89 valuable runs, before being dismissed. Simmons carried on and scored his second ODI hundred. Russell too played a handy cameo to push the West Indies score past 300. The Ireland spinners bowled 26 overs and conceded 109 runs, while the pacers leaked 194 runs. McBrine bowled very well for 10-1-26-0, but Dockrell was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 3/50.Earlier, after opting to bowl, Ireland put immense pressure on the West Indies batsmen with disciplined bowling. Smith threw away a start and Gayle, despite getting his eye in, couldn't get going. He took 54 balls to hit a maximum. Ireland captain Porterfield employed spinners and they stemmed the run flow. West Indies lost their way in the middle, but Simmons and Sammy, after spending some time, played their shots to transfer the pressure back onto the Ireland bowlers. Once both were set, it was hard work for the bowlers as they scored boundaries at will.From 87/5, West Indies have recovered well to post 304. When Dockrell removed Gayle, Samuels and Ramdin in a space of 8 balls, things weren't looking great for Holder and Co. but Simmons and Sammy combined very well to share a 154-run counter-attacking stand to swing the pendulum back in West Indies' favour.4

The umpire is however taking a lot of time to check the edge. Hawk-Eye shows that it is hitting leg and the onfield decision is upheld. Samuels has to go.

This is one of the better pitches I have seen for a long time. It's got grass on it, but it's an even covering. Speaking to the groundsmen and his team, they feel this will go through, there will be a little bit of bounce and little bit of pace as well. I don't see it turning. The ball will come onto the bat. A lot of runs to be scored on this wicket," reckons Ian BothamTeams:West Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Dwayne Smith, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Lendl Simmons, Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Kemar RoachIreland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, Max Sorensen, George Dockrell, Andy McBrinePorterfield: "We have a good blend in the squad. Few lads are playing their first World Cup, while few are playing their third. We will have a bowl. We have been here for a couple of days and it swung around a bit in the nets and we can utilize that upfront. I think you got to target every game, but every game is a two point game."Holder: "It is a great thrill to lead my country. It is a wonderful cricket stadium. I would have liked to bowl as well. Seems to have a bit of grass and having said that we have to bat and put some runs on the board. Benn is struggling this morning, we left him out. We brought in the extra seamer in Kemar Roach. Yeah not too worried about him (Gayle), backing him to give 100 percent today."Ireland have won the toss and have opted to fieldHello and welcome to the 5th game of the World Cup. All the previous 4 games saw teams scoring 300 and above batting first. Will the trend continue? We will find out soon. But before that, toss and teams will come your way in a little while from now. Stay tuned.IrelandIreland won the Dubai Triangular tournament prior to the warm-up games, a tournament that had Scotland and Afghanistan as the other two teams. However, in their first warm-up game, Scotland defeated Ireland by a mammoth margin of 179 runs, after the Scots posted 296 batting first. The Irish batting never got going and folded for just 117. In their second warm-up game, they were a different outfit altogether, winning by 4 wickets against Bangladesh. Mooney and Sorensen were superb with the ball on that occasion and were the chief architects of the win. They can surely defeat any team on their day.Talking about Ireland, the team might not be expected to reach the quarter-finals, but they have the firepower to cause an upset. Led by William Porterfield, the Irish team consists of match-winners like Kevin O'Brien, who can take the game away from the opposition single-handedly. Apart from Kevin, his brother Niall can also pack a punch. Their all-rounders lower down the order can be very handy as well.West IndiesWest Indies last played in South Africa and lost the ODI series 4-1. They were beaten comprehensively. Looking back at their warm-ups, they were thumped by England, after they were bowled out for a paltry 122. In their second game against Scotland, they went onto score 313 batting first. However, they were lucky to win the game by 3 runs as Scotland lost 4 wickets in 7 runs to finish at 310/9. Their bowling doesn't look threatening and they might find it difficult against the big teams.West Indies enter the tournament with two big names missing from their squad - Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard. Both of them were important members of the squad before the World Cup squad was announced, but unfortunately a rift with the West Indies board meant they were ignored for this tournament. Apart from that, Sunil Narine pulled out of the World Cup squad, seeking more time to rectify his bowling action.Let's take a look at the form and composition of both the teams.Even though West Indies will enter the game as favorites, they will be wary of the Irish challenge, especially after their heroics against England in the 2011 World Cup. West Indies might have big names like Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels and Kemar Roach in their squad, but if they don't fire, they will be in deep trouble.South Africa, India and Pakistan are the three teams everyone expects in the quarter-finals of the World Cup. We could well get an idea of who would take the fourth quarters spot from Pool B today. West Indies usually would be the favorites to go through as the fourth team, but with Ireland and Zimbabwe playing well, it could well prove out to be a 3-way fight.Preview:Let's go back in time a bit. February 19, 2014 was the date for the West Indies-Ireland T20 encounter in Jamaica. The Caribbean team, winner at the T20 World Cup in 2012, failed to get going and was restricted to 116 for 8, after which the Irish fashioned a six-wicket win in the last over.Cut to the 2015 World Cup, and both teams are ready again for Monday's Pool B encounter at Nelson. The chances of an Irish upset are greater than they were in Jamaica, even if it's a different format. What gives Ireland a lot of heart is West Indies' recent form. Jason Holder's men in the run-up to the tournament suffered a 4-1 ODI defeat to South Africa and then in both their warm-ups they gave a poor account of themselves. Against England, all they could manage was 122 and lost the match by nine wickets with 27.1 overs still to spare and against Scotland, they barely won: the victory margin of three runs despite scoring 313 for 9 spoke a great deal about how unconvincing their bowling was.Ireland weren't much convincing either in their warm-ups. They lost to Scotland by 179 runs after getting bowled out for a lowly 117, but then they upset a Test-playing nation in Bangladesh as they chased down 190. If not their upset victory in 2014, the one against Bangladesh will surely give Ireland a lot of confidence.Ireland's chances of reaching the quarter-finals are next to impossible but they know that they can upset the apple carts of a few teams. West Indies are one of the vulnerable Test-playing nations and Ireland know that too. However, Holder wasn't too worried."They are not to be under-estimated but having said that, we are very confident," he said on Sunday."Obviously you go through tough times in your cricket and you just move on and take whatever you can from it."We're starting a new campaign and I think it's important that we all put our minds on it and just go out and play some good cricket for West Indies. We'll start from ball one and go out and play some hard, aggressive cricket."If you thought that was confidence, hear out Ireland captain William Porterfield. "I don't think it will be a surprise. We've played enough cricket now and everyone knows everyone. There are not many teams that won't know much about the 15 lads who are in our squad," he said.Clearly, both teams are fancying themselves on the high-scoring pitch at Nelson, but looking at the 4-0 ODI head-to-head in West Indies' favour (including two World Cup wins), there are no prizes for guessing as to who is heading into the match as favourites.Teams:West Indies (From): Dwayne Smith, Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy, Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Jerome Taylor, Kemar Roach, Nikita Miller, Sheldon Cottrell, Jonathan Carter, Sulieman BennIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Gary Wilson(w), Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, George Dockrell, Max Sorensen, Craig Young, Alex Cusack, Peter Chase, Stuart Thompson, Andy McBrineLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
