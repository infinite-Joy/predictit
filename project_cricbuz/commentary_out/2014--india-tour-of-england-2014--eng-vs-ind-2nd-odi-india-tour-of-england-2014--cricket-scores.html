The game will restart at 3:30 local time. We still do not know if the overs have been reduced. Stay tuned for more updates..The covers were coming off, but it started to rain again and they are being pulled back on. Looks like it is going to be that kind of a day.Welcome back.. The England openers who were on the field are seen walking back as it has started raining. The Indians don't want to go. The umpires have asked the groundsmen to bring on the hover-cover. The rain has got heavier. The visitors are slowly trudging off the field now. Hopefully, it won't last long and we get a full game in.India in England,19902nd Test- Old Trafford, Match DrawnGooch continued from where he had left off at Lord's, making 116. His opening partner, Michael Atherton also compiled a ton of his own, which was built brick by brick, in contrast to Gooch's scintillating stroke-play. Robin Smith also came to the party as England piled up 519 in the first innings. The spinners - Anil Kumble and Narendra Hirwani - toiled hard bagging 7 wickets for 279 runs between themMohammad Azharuddin led India's reply with an elegant 179 with Sanjay Manjrekar giving him quiet support, the upshot being India posting a fighting 432. Allan Lamb produced a century in England's strong second innings, which left India chasing 408.Though Shastri and Sidhu perished early the middle order stood up to be counted. It was here that Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar scored his first of his hundred international hundreds - an innings which staved off a likely defeat. The teenage sensation played a wide array of strokes but it was his sound temperament that stood out.England bowlers started off well, but the back-up to Anderson and Woakes was not good enough. Tredwell varied his pace and troubled the batsmen, he finished with figures of 2/42. The hosts' batsmen are up against a daunting task as the last time England chased above 300 was way back in 2007. Can they change that today? Join us in a few minutes to find out. Before that here is part 37 of our detailing of the England-India series in England..India have done exceedingly well to get past 300, after being reduced to 19/2. They have recovered well. First, it was the Rohit and Rahane partnership, the Mumbai duo added 91 runs for the third wicket, but both batsmen threw their wickets away when they looked well set. The score was 132/4 when Dhoni joined Raina, together they took the bowling apart with a 144-run stand for the fifth. Not only did they launch big, but they also ran hard and converted the singles into twos. Raina, having survived an lbw appeal off Tredwell, made full use of the opportunity as he brought up his first hundred outside the sub-continent. Dhoni continued his form from the Tests and scored a quick-fire fifty, those two innings helped India post a massive total.4

INDIA:2.5 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, very poor batting. Feet are stuck in the crease and the hands just follow the ball. Tries to punch off the back foot and the ball rises past the outside edge, to go into Buttler's gloves
INDIA:2.4 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, short of length outside off, Rohit plays a solid back foot defensive stroke towards mid-off. Got into a good position there
INDIA:2.3 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, slips down leg and hits Rohit on the thigh pad. No real appeal from England for they knew where the ball was heading
INDIA:2.2 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, great backing up by Cook. Saved some runs there, Stokes was the fielder at mid-on who tried to run Dhawan out, but Dhawan was back home. Cook dived across to cut off the extra runs
INDIA:2.1 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, extravagant seam movement for Anderson and still Rohit pushes out to defend. It missed the bat by a long, long way. Very poor cricket from Rohit. He should be leaving those alone all day
INDIA:2.1 J Anderson to Rohit, wide, ironic cheers from the crowd as Anderson slips one down leg. First runs for India and it has come via an extra
INDIA:1.6 Woakes to Dhawan, no run, short of length on the hips, Dhawan got a freebie there, but since it bounced extra, he couldn't nail the flick. Rolls off the body and down onto the wicket, back to the bowler, second maiden over in a row
INDIA:1.5 Woakes to Dhawan, no run, beaten! Superb bowling this from Woakes, draws Dhawan forward with a delivery that is angled across, pitched around off - which meant Dhawan had to cover the line and play at it, it kept angling away and beat the bat
INDIA:1.4 Woakes to Dhawan, no run, great carry to Buttler, who takes it above his head. Four left alone in a row
INDIA:1.3 Woakes to Dhawan, no run, almost close to being called a wide, but not called as Dhawan leaves for the third time in a row to a delivery outside offWoakes too has two slips in place
INDIA:1.2 Woakes to Dhawan, no run, another good leave for it was a rising, steepling short of length delivery outside off. Was close enough to play, but Dhawan saw it through
INDIA:1.1 Woakes to Dhawan, no run, short of length and outside off, left alone sensibly by DhawanChris Woakes, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
INDIA:0.6 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, now beats Rohit for the third time in the over with seam movement. Pitched on a short of length and seamed away past the groping, hanging blade of Rohit. Rohit looks very tentative early on against the moving ball and it's just the opening over of the game
INDIA:0.5 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, beautiful delivery, holds its line outside off, Rohit pushed forward to defend and he was comprehensively beaten. Could've left that alone, but lunged out at it to play
INDIA:0.4 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, short of length on the stumps, Rohit defends it solidly back down the track
INDIA:0.3 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, another outswinger, but starts on middle, not on a fuller length too, so Rohit defends to point with an open face
INDIA:0.2 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, beaten outside off! The familiar story continues. Pitched outside off and moved away, Rohit prodded at it nervously - well away from the body - and was lucky not to edge it. Lovely shape from AndersonAnderson is operating with a couple of slips in place
INDIA:0.1 J Anderson to Rohit, no run, swing for Anderson first up, on off and on a fuller length, Rohit pushes it to mid-off and wants a quick single to get off the mark, but Dhawan isn't interested. Sent back in timeRohit and Dhawan are at the crease. Rohit is on strike. J Anderson will open the attackThere is a nice presence from the Indian contigent in the crowd. All decked up with the tri-colour being a prominent display. The conditions may have changed but it will once again be Anderson who will be operating with the white ball. The Indian openers walk out to a loud rendition of 'Jerusalem'. A rousing end to Jerusalem and we are all set for the action to begin...Yes, Hales will make his ODI debut today. He had a forgettable T20I debut against the same team - he was out for nought. Cook handed his maiden ODI cap earlier in the day. No fresh faces for the visitors though. Rayudu also misses the cut.Teams:England (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Alex Hales, Ian Bell, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, James AndersonIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Mohit SharmaDhoni: 'We were looking to bowl first as well, considering the pitch and rain forecast. It is good to have fresh legs. What is important is to play well in the 4 ODIs. It is important to survive but we have to commit to our shots. The freedom of playing shots is very crucial.'Cook: 'We are going to have a bowl first. It is because of the surface. It will do a little bit early on. We have to put the ball in the right areas. We have gone for Jimmy, Woakes, CJ and Ben Stokes. It is a great opportunity to attack these next 6 months and peak at the right time. He (Alex Hales) will remember this day. He has been in fine form with the bat.'England have won the toss and have opted to fieldThe sun peeks into Sophia Gardens as MS Dhoni and Ali Cook stride out for the toss.'We will have a prompt start today,' says Alan Wilkins on air. Over to the flip of the coin.Pitch report: "It is what you call a typical English day. Typical English pitch as well. There is some grass but it has a bit of moisture. It has been raining for the last couple of days. With two new balls, the ball will seam around for the first 15-20 overs. Win the toss and bowl first" prescribe Sanjay Manjrekar and Wasim Akram.Live pictures show that conditions are chilly. The Indians have their jumpers on as they undergo their warm-up exercises.For more news on the weather check out Gautam Bhimani's tweet: Promising start over Cardiff Bay. Forecast brightening by the hourIt's time to wrap up this segment. And today is the 106th birth anniversary of Sir Donald Bradman. The greatest ever batsman? I'll let you call all the shots on this.'Among the bowlers, leg-spinner Karn Sharma rolled his arm over the most, and consequently he got hammered more often than the others (Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin and Suresh Raina). In between, however, he did get applause from coach Duncan Fletcher and director Ravi Shastri for the odd delivery. Nets aren't definitive indications of what a playing XI is going to be like, and perhaps Karn bowled as much as he did because India were looking to practise against spin. However, the way Shastri singled out the leggie early on for a little pep talk triggered speculation.'He writes, 'Cardiff is a venue that offers decent assistance to spinners, and the Indian drill looked like a plan not to allow Moeen Ali and James Tredwell settle in.'Daksh Panwar's special for the Indian Express has the headline: Spinning wheels of fortuneHe adds 'Shastri, in any case, isn't the type to play second fiddle. That's just not him, for he likes to call the shots. Those who have worked with Shastri, in one capacity or the other, are bound to vouch for that without a second thought. As first reported in these columns, from London last week, Shastri himself made it clear that Fletcher would report to him.'Mahendra Singh Dhoni's comments in Bristol on Sunday may have come as manna from heaven for head coach Duncan Fletcher, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India isn't on the same page as the captain. In an interaction with the media, on the eve of the ODIs against England, Dhoni said: He (Fletcher) will lead us into the World Cup... Also, he is still the boss.Lokendra Pratap Sahi, writing for the Telegraph, Calcutta throws the spotlight on Shastri and Fletcher.'This is what the Indians need to do at this moment. A lot of things are happening in Indian cricket, too much is being written about and talked about and the players just need to get away from it. India will be happy to go back to Cardiff. They have great memories there and had an outstanding Champions Trophy last year, writes former India skipper, Sourav Ganguly for the Hindustan Times'It's important on such long trips to take time off from the game and get to the calmness of the countryside as it helps rejuvenate and come back fresh. Sometimes, such opportunities help to get away from the nets and think about the game which helps to come back as better players.''Wales is a fabulous place, not only beautiful but the people are unbelievably friendly. It's a beautiful part of South of England and the India boys will be happy to get away from the city life to the brilliant water sides, wharfs as they say here. It is a great opportunity to have the best fish and chips of the country.''But with the other opener being skipper Alastair Cook, Bell knows he is the man who will have to make way for the change. Ever adaptable, Bell has batted in every position bar eight and 10 in England's one-day team, says Dean Wilson in his piece for the Daily Mirror.'Ian Bell has revealed he is happy to give up his one-day opener's slot for Alex Hales to lead England's World Cup charge. Hales has made a deafening case for inclusion at the top of the order and will give England the firepower they need to challenge for the trophy next March.''There are only three England survivors from that 2011 game in Cardiff this week: Alastair Cook, Ian Bell and Steve Finn. So much hinges on a successful opening partnership and England will, if the rain goes away, reveal their latest model in Cardiff: the Cook/Hales combo. Both will find themselves under intense scrutiny throughout the series. Cook, for whom there is no respite in 2014, is being advised by some of his mates that he should not be leading England in ODI cricket. Goodness knows what his enemies are advocating.'He writes, 'Wales has always been a happy hunting ground for England at least as far as cricket is concerned. In one-day internationals, England have never lost there; in seven matches they have won four and three, rather ominously, have been no results. After the downpour at Bristol on Monday, which caused the first match of the series against India to be abandoned, another no-result in Cardiff would test the patience of cricketers, punters and preview writers.'Vic Marks' piece for the Guardian wears the headline: Cook and Hales feel the heat as England prepare to face India in CardiffAs is the norm, let us plunge into what the newspapers have in store for us before the action begins.The likes of Eoin Morgan and Chris Jordan are fine ODI players as well. Coming back to India, they had a few bright sparks in the tour match versus Middlesex. Kohli and Rayudu scored fifties each while Karn Sharma took a 3-fer. Kohli will also have fond memories of Cardiff where he has scored a ton and a fifty in the three matches he has played here. In fact, India's deputy captain averages close to 100 in ODIs at Cardiff, the most by any batsman at this venue.Meanwhile, England have a few issues of their own. They have not won an ODI series at home since 2012. Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan have lashed out at the team for the lack of firepower. Bopara's exclusion has raised a few eyebrows but Alex Hales, who will make his ODI debut today, injects that X-factor to the team. With Hales set to occupy the top slot alongside Captain Cook, Bell will shift to one drop.Dhoni though made a strong statement, emphasizing that Fletcher is the boss till the 2015 World Cup. Plenty of questions are left unanswered.It is imperative for India to bury the Test series and start afresh. The newbies - Karn Sharma, Sanju Samson and Dhawal Kulkarni - will look to catch the eye with whatever opportunities they receive. There has been a reshuffle of the Indian management following the spineless surrender in the last three Test matches. It was reported that Ravi Shastri, the new Director of Team India, oversaw the warm-ups yesterday with jeans and brown suede loafers. Then, what is Duncan Fletcher's role in the team? Is it the end of the road for him along with Joe Dawes and Trevor Penny? Can India zero in on the ideal XI and deliver on the field?After the no-show at Bristol, the cricket caravan moves to Cardiff. The weather is more promising although some showers have been predicted in the late afternoon. Both sides will want to figure out the right combination and build assiduously for the World Cup.Preview by Bharath RamarajWith the opening game being washed out without a ball being bowled, it is effectively a four-match series now as England get set to take on India in the second game of the 5-match ODI series at the Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. The Indian team led by MS Dhoni will look to emerge out of the doom and gloom of losing the Test series 3-1 to England by making a sterling comeback in the ODIs. The Indian think-tank will be encouraged by the fact that the present set of players like Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan, Ravindra Jadeja and Dhoni himself tend to do better in the abridged version of the game. On the other hand, England under Alastair Cook's captaincy will look to continue their dominance over India by winning the ODI series.EnglandWith seniors like Jonathon Trott, Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann missing from the line-up for different reasons, England are in a rebuilding phase. Their go-to man in the ODI format, Stuart Broad, too won't take part in the series due to a knee injury.England selectors have tried to bring in a few new faces into the squad, and one of them is Alex Hales. The towering giant from Nottinghamshire, known for his whirlwind knocks in T20Is hasn't yet played for England in ODIs. Hales was set to make his debut in the 50-over format in Bristol, but a washout meant that he will now head to Cardiff in hopes of having a memorable maiden game. On his day, the 25-year-old has the ability to rip-apart the opposition attack with a compendium of eye-catching strokes. He mainly targets the area between long on and long off region. Hales, can also play debonair pulls and hooks.Captain Cook, on the eve of the ODI series, confirmed that Hales will open the batting with him. This means that Ian Bell will bat at number three while the English middle order also has quite a few batsmen who bring in dash of bravado. The southpaw, Eoin Morgan, will continue to be the engine room of the middle-order. It has to be said though, Joe Root has shown that he can change gears as and when required. Moeen Ali, likely will find a place in the line-up, as he can twirl his arm over and take wickets with his brand of off-spin. Jos Buttler will be expected to go for the jugular and provide the finishing touches in the end overs by playing with vitality and vigour.In the bowling department, James Anderson, will look to torment the Indian batsmen yet again with seam and swing. Since struggling in 2011 World Cup in the subcontinent, Anderson seems to have altered his modus operandi ever so slightly, as he generally hits back of a length in the shorter version of the game. Only when he finds some movement in the air or off the track, he tends to pitch it up further. It has certainly helped the stalwart of the England attack, as he has taken 65 wickets since 2011 World Cup at an average of 21.04.With Broad not in the squad, Steven Finn gets a chance to prove his worth. Finn, has all the required attributes to take wickets in the ODI series against India. If anything, he struggles a bit against left-handed batsmen. Harry Gurney is a fine addition to the setup. Gurney, being a left-arm quick, brings that much-needed variety to the line-up. Chris Jordan too has been among the wickets. James Tredwell is the main spinner in the squad. It is also intriguing to note that Ravi Bopara, a fine performer for England in the last few years has been dropped, and they have shown faith in the young all-rounder, Ben Stokes.IndiaThe Indian setup would look to rekindle the fond memories of winning the Champions Trophy 2013 that took place in England. However, it would be an uphill task for the Indian think-tank to lift the sagging morale of the team. They need to show a bit of character after the thumping India received at the hands of England in Tests.In the batting line-up, Dhawan and Rohit Sharma are expected to open the innings in the first match. With field restrictions in place, good batting tracks and pacers generally bowling dry lengths, it can help the opening duo to play through the line and accrue runs.Kohli, who found runs hard to come by in Tests will look to show his worth in the ODI series. He is proven performer in this format. Kohli, when required, can pace the innings and in the end overs, plays with that raw boyishness to flay the opposition ranks all over the ground. Ajinkya Rahane and the experienced campaigner, Suresh Raina, bring solidarity to the middle-order. Of course in Dhoni, India have arguably the greatest finisher of all time in this format. India may also use Stuart Binny or Sanju Samson as a floater in the batting order.India's bowling will depend on the swing merchant, Bhuvneshwar Kumar. In fact, it is largely an inexperienced pace attack. So, it is imperative that Mohammed Shami delivers the goods and bowls well in tandem with Kumar upfront. Mohit Sharma, the medium pacer has shown that he has a few variations up his sleeve.With umpires ready to give batsmen lbw on the front-foot, Jadeja, has made his mark during the last few years. He also bowls with good control. Ravichandran Ashwin can also come in handy with his off-breaks. Both of them can put up fine performances with the bat too. There is an inkling that leg-spinners can trouble English batsmen. However, it doesn't seem likely that Karn Sharma will be preferred to Ashwin or Jadeja for the first game. India dropped a lot of chances during the Test series, but in recent times, the ground fielding has been of acceptable standards in ODIs.Ground conditions and weatherUsually the track at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, tends to offer a bit of help for the seamers early in the piece, before turning into a good batting track. Teams generally prefer to bowl first at Cardiff.As far as the weather is concerned, light rain is predicted for the afternoon - which may bring the D/L method into play - and this perhaps will further influence the captain winning the toss to field first.TriviaAlastair Cook needs 33 more runs to amass 3,000 ODI runs.Joe Root needs 32 more runs to reach the landmark of 1,000 ODI runs.Out of the 16 ODIs played in Cardiff, the team batting first has only won twice.QuotesA change of format will obviously do them good. It's not quite the same ground-hog day for them probably. We've got to remember they're world champions at 50-overs, so they obviously know what they're doing and will probably go into this as favourites: Alastair Cook.There is no need to remind anyone that we are World Champions. England are quite an intelligent side. Not to forget when we last came here, we won the Champions Trophy. We have had the success. It's just that we have to stand up and take responsibility, back each other up: MS DhoniTeams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Mohit Sharma, Dhawal Kulkarni, Sanju Samson, Stuart Binny, Karn SharmaEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Alex Hales, Ian Bell, Gary Ballance, Joe Root, Moeen Ali, Jos Buttler(w), Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, James Anderson, Harry Gurney, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Chris Woakes, Ben StokesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
