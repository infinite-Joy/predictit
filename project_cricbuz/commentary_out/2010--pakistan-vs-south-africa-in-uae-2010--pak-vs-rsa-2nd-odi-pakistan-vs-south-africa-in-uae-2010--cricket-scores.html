Kallis has also been ruled out, so Petersen and Albie Morkel come into the side.South Africa have won the toss and elected to batHappy Hallowen Day to everyone out there!Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the 2nd ODI between Pakistan and South Africa from Abu Dhabi. Pakistan have played well below par in both the T20s and the first ODI, and would be looking to improve their performance by a few notches if they are to cross the line tonight. South Africa on the other hand have looked at their dominating best and have looked like a side on a mission. Smith and Kallis are doubtful starters for the game, something which the Pakistan side would be looking to take advantage of.The toss will happen at 4:00 PM IST, so stay connected for all the news from the centre.by Vishaal LoganathanCriticism for Pakistan has been pouring in from all around after their dismal show in this series so far. Their batting has been reckless and their bowling unfortunately has not yet been given a fair opportunity to test the opposition. Pakistan suffered another humiliating loss at the hands of South Africa in the first ODI in Abu Dhabi. South Africa's impressive run this summer has continued and Pakistan will look to draw inspiration from somewhere if they are to level the series in the second ODI.South AfricaThe Proteas have had a fantastic time on this tour so far. They have been victorious on all 3 occasions and they will definitely be going into the 2nd ODI with thoughts of going 2-0 up. They would be delighted with how the entire team is performing but the fitness of the two most senior players in the squad, Jacques Kallis and captain Graeme Smith remains a concern. The Proteas did extremely well to skittle out the Pakistanis for 203 after a century plus stand between Younis and Hafeez threatened to take the game away from them. Tsotsobe's impressive form in the series continued with a 4 wicket haul. PakistanPakistan's batting woes continued in the first ODI. Their batting simply crumbled thanks to some disciplined bowling by the Proteas and some outrageous shot-selection by the batsmen. Younis and Hafeez had given Pakistan a solid foundation with a 100+ partnership, but the other batsmen simply failed to capitalize on the stand as they lost the last 9 wickets for a mere 63 runs. Younis and Hafeez's batting was the only positive Pak could take away from the 1st ODI.Their bowlers had very few runs to defend, and significant partnerships by the South Africans put the game beyond doubt by the half way mark itself.South Africa will be looking to take 2 to nothing lead in the series, and they are clear favourites to do so. Pakistan, on the other hand, will hope for their batting to put up a more gritty performance and ensure each of their batsmen put a price on their wicket and make the Proteas work hard.
