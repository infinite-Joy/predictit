This is Ajith, who will take you through till the end. Fasten your seatbelts, Gayle looks to be in a hurry.Mr. Gayle is just 1 run away from reaching 8000 runs!Well, can you believe it? It's been West Indies all the way though they are currently below Bangladesh in the ICC rankings. Take a bow, the Caribbean boys, you have been absolutely devastating. Tamim failed, and the rest of the batsmen followed. That's the story if I have to put it out in a sentence. This is the lowest total in this WC, the lowest ODI score by Bangladesh in ODIs. They never got any partnership going and the pitch, which was slower than what we have seen of late, assisted the West Indies bowlers and they made the most of it. It has been a poor outing for the hosts, the crowd are getting angry and throwing papers on the ground. Don't go away, WI will come out to bat in a couple of minutes.Roach: We had a goal set and we came out on top. Good to see Sammy get some wickets, glad for myself and the team. It's not over yet but we are confident we'll get it. The guys bowled well and I'll just wait and see the guys knock over the runs now.1

This is a slow pitch, you can't drive on the up without keeping it down. Hasan leant forward to square drive, failed to keep it down, Pollard dived forward and took a sharp catch with both hands.

Beautiful loop on that ball, from over the wicket to the leftie, it dipped on Shakib Al Hasan who was caught in two minds, whether to sweep or defend, he was looking to sweep, then the ball dipped, snuck under the bat and turned in sharply between the gap and hit off stump.

BANGLADESH:8.2  Roach to Siddique, out Lbw!! The previous yorker off a free hit would've been close had it not been a free hit. But this time, Roach delivers another special yorker. Ian Bishop was saying on air, how he wished that he could bowl those yorkers at will and Roach produced another superb toe crusher. Siddique played all around that, fell over in trying to flick, it hit him on the left toe. It would have crashed into the base of middle stump. That's Roach's strength, he will suddenly produce a thunderbolt that the batsman would have no answer. The crowd go silent once more. Siddique lbw b Roach 25(27) [4s-4] Roach to Siddique, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Siddique has been given out LBW, he his reviewing it. Looks plumb. All three reds and Roach has struck again.

How will their batsmen tackle Roach and Co?

We are going in with the same team that we played against Netherlands. We are confident of doing well.Shakib: We would want to bat first, we like to put some runs on board and defend it later on. The wicket will be easier to bat on under the sun. West Indies have some experienced players, we have home advantage and hopefully we will capitalise on that. We are going in with an unchanged side.Bright and sunny conditions, we are all set for the toss. The captains are out with Ian Bishop.Pitch report: There are some cracks on the wicket, the ball will stay low and it will be a slow wicket. It gets worse as the game progresses, the batsmen need to apply themselves. The captain who wins the toss would look to bat first.A warm welcome to one and all, welcome to the clash of the dark horses, Bangladesh lock horns with West Indies at Mirpur. While Bangladesh have home advantage, West Indies are coming out of a massive win and their prime bowler - Roach - is in terrific form. Who will have the last laugh? This is Ajith bringing you all the action along with Pradeep, Ganesh and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be back with the pitch report and the toss.Preview by Ganesh ChandrasekaranThe terms "dangerous", "dark horses", "unpredictable" etc can be used to describe both West Indies and Bangladesh quite aptly. Their performances so far in the tournament have mirrored each other's quite a bit. Both teams have lost a match against a pre-tournament favourite and both have registered a win over one of the lesser fancied teams.
While the team performances have been similar, the performances of their respective captains could not be more contrasting. Shakib, for Bangladesh, has been an inspirational leader for the young team and is an important cog in both batting and bowling while Darren Sammy, an all-rounder himself has been rather conspicuous by his absence and one gets the feeling that his role in the team is not clearly defined. With the fight for a quarterfinal berth getting increasingly tougher with Ireland emerging as new contenders, both teams will strive for a win before going on to face tougher challenges. Bangladesh:Bangladesh came into the tournament after a morale boosting whitewash of the Kiwis at home. This had led many to believe that they would be posing a stiff threat to India in the tournament opener but it was not to be as they were walloped by 87 runs.
The next game against Ireland proved to be tighter than what they would have liked but they showed immense spirit in defending a modest total in front of a boisterous home crowd. The home support has been rather overwhelming and could play on the minds of the players once the expectations begin to rise.
Shakib and his team have responded pretty well so far and come Friday they would be looking to bring more joy to their passionate fans. Tamim Iqbal has once again shouldered the batting responsibility and will be looking for more support from the likes of Shakib and Ashraful.
The pace bowling seemed to lack some teeth but Shafiul Islam did come into his own with the old ball, under the lights and he will look to build on the confidence gained. Spin, the strength of Bangladesh will definitely play a pivotal part on the slow and low tracks at Bangladesh and with Razzak heading this department, it looks to be in pretty safe hands. West Indies:The loss of the talisman Dwayne Bravo was a huge blow for West Indies given the dual role he could play so effectively in the limited overs game. They did not seem to miss him too much against Netherlands though as Kemar Roach hit full throttle to blast the Dutch away. The batting, barring Darren Bravo, came a cropper against South Africa but it was a much improved performance against Netherlands with the mercurial Gayle leading the way. Pollard showed exactly how destructive he can be but it will be a totally different game against the wily Bangladeshi spinners and it will definitely be interesting to see how he responds to this challenge. It is here that Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan could play an important part, in the middle overs against the spinners. Both of them are perfectly capable of playing the waiting game and both can switch gears when required.
On the bowling front, WI have adopted an interesting strategy of opening with the gangly Benn and it has worked out pretty well for them. Benn was miserly against the Dutch stifling them for runs and picking up wickets when they went after him. The Bangladeshis should have plans for him and would take him lightly at their own peril. Head to head:Interestingly Bangladesh have never won a match at home against West Indies, they have played five and lost four with one match ending with no result but Bangladesh has got the better of West Indies on the last three occasions they met. In World Cups, they have met twice, with the 2003 match being called off due to rain and WI winning comprehensively in 2007. Face off: Tamim Iqbal vs Kemar RoachAn aggressive opener facing up to an equally sharp and quick paceman is an exciting prospect and one such battle awaits us in the game between Bang and WI. Tamim Iqbal facing Kemar Roach will definitely send some sparks flying and we could be in for a cracker of a contest if the two decide to attack each other in the initial stages. Quotes:Abdur Razzak: It did not happen(spin) in the first two matches, but I think this one will help us. It will give us a good chance to beat the West Indies.
Kemar Roach: My target is to win every single match and lift the World Cup. I am very confident we can do it. We are playing positive cricket and the guys are improving every day.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan(c), Raqibul Hasan, Mohammad Ashraful, Mahmudullah, Abdur Razzak, Suhrawadi Shuvo, Shafiul Islam, Naeem Islam, Nazmul Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Shahriar NafeesWest Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Devon Smith, Darren Bravo, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Kieron Pollard, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Sulieman Benn, Nikita Miller, Kemar Roach, Ravi Rampaul, Andre Russell, Kirk Edwards, Devendra BishooLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
