Guptill is on strike. Philander will open the attackPhilander to open the proceedings for South Africa, he has one slip in placeWelcome back! The players are moseying out to the middle, this will be a tricky chase for New Zealand as the pitch stayed low and slow throughout South Africa's inningsAt one stage, South Africa were 134/6, but a fighting fifty from Behardien - his highest score in ODIs, alongside Philander added 54 runs for the 7th wicket. He perished while trying to up the ante. The rest of the tail fluttered away and the hosts were rolled over for 204 - their lowest completed score at Potchefstroom while batting first. Bracewell was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets and was well supported by the rest of his mates. Can Black Caps overhaul the target and level the series? Or will Steyn and Co. defend this low total? Join us back in a few minutes to find out...New Zealand should be happy with their effort with the ball. South Africa opted to bat after AB won the toss. However, things didn't go according to plan. The pitch was slow and the Kiwi bowlers were disciplined. Amla and van Wyk went in quick succession to leave the hosts tottering at 20/2. AB and Rossouw steadied the innings with a 48-run stand, but the latter fell playing an ambitious loft. Miller didn't last long and was soon followed by AB.4

The hosts were cock-a-hoop in the first game. Amla and Rossouw stitched a 185-run stand for the second wicket which helped the Proteas post a mammoth total. Later, their bowlers responded well by picking wickets at regular intervals. Even though, New Zealand inched close towards the victory in the end, it was the constant pressure from the South African bowlers which undid the NZ lower middle order. This will be a crucial game for both the sides. Do stay tuned for the toss and team news....It's squeaky bum time for the New Zealanders. They can't afford to lose this game. Remember, they had lost the first game in their previous tour against Zimbabwe. However, they came back strong in the next two games to clinch the series. Can they replicate the same in South Africa? New Zealand, led by Kane Williamson missed a fluent knock as they fell short by 20 runs in the first game. A few batsmen got starts but failed to monetize it into a big one. Williamson also confirmed the same during the post-match talk. " The guys came out and played their roles and took us close. Maybe if we had carried a partnership or two, we would have won it," he revealed.Preview:Following their victory in the opening ODI against New Zealand, South Africa skipper AB de Villiers admitted that the hosts lacked intensity and energy when it came to their performance on the field. He will be eager for a clinical show from the Proteas when they take on the Black Caps in the second ODI in a bid to clinch the three-match series. New Zealand, meanwhile, will be hoping to stay alive in the series, and in order to do so, they will have to pull up their socks and come up with a disciplined performance.Match Date: August 22, 2015Start Time: 10:00 local time (13:30 IST)Venue: Senwes Park, PotchefstroomWeather: Mostly sunny with a high of 30 degree CelsiusTeam News:South Africa:With Faf du Plessis still unavailable due to a knee injury, South Africa are likely to go in with an unchanged eleven for the second ODI. Morne van Wyk, despite his recent failures, is unlikely to be left out unless AB de Villiers decides to don the keeper's gloves. If the South African skipper does have a change of heart, Dean Elgar, who recently scored a half-century against Australia A in the tri-series, could find a place in the eleven.Probable XI: Morne van Wyk/Dean Elgar, Hashim Amla, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, David Wiese, Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn, Imran TahirNew Zealand:Martin Guptill injured his left hand and had to bat down the order after falling awkwardly on the field in the first ODI. Scans revealed that he did not suffer any major damage and he is likely to feature in the eleven for the second game. In case he misses out, New Zealand could bring in George Worker while Luke Ronchi might have to open like he did in the first match.Probable XI: Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson, Colin Munro, Grant Elliott, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi, Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Mitchell McClenagahan, Ish SodhiNumbers:50: The number of runs AB de Villiers requires to become the third South African to get 8000 ODI runs. Having got his 7950 runs in 180 innings, de Villiers is set to become the fastest to 8000 runs. Sourav Ganguly, who got to 8000 in 200 innings, currently tops that chart.133: The number of runs Hashim Amla needs to get to the landmark of 6000 runs in ODIs. Amla, with 5867 runs in 116 innings, has the luxury of a handful of innings to get past Virat Kohli, who reached 6000 in 136 innings.Quotes:We are putting ourselves under pressure to win the game to wrap up the series.
