PAKISTAN:15.2  Oram to Afridi, FOUR!!, entertainment guaranteed if Afridi is at the crease, what a lovely shot too, leant forward and bent his front knee and whipped it like a tennis shot, more of a wristy flick and the ball flies over mid wicket, stylishly done by Afridi
PAKISTAN:15.1  Oram to Afridi, no run, solid backfoot defence from Afridi to a good length delivery on off stump
PAKISTAN:14.6  Southee to Umar Akmal, no run, short of length delivery outside off, Umar Akmal chops it hard into the ground, with no timing
PAKISTAN:14.5  Southee to Afridi, 1 run, and he starts off with a nice crispy drive wide of mid off, a diving Nathan moves to his left to cut it offShahid Afridi, right handed bat, comes to the creaseTime for drinks as well as the players use this opportunity to get a drink. Wasim Akram on air with one of his patented cliches after Styris took that catch: 'He is one of the best fielders in that position.' Waz always says that on air, any fielder who takes a catch is the best in that position. Right, it is time for some Boom Boom as Afridi marches out to the crease.
PAKISTAN:14.4  Southee to Misbah-ul-Haq, out Caught by Styris!! The Kiwis are catching everything. Looks like they won't miss a fly too. I'm saying this because there are a lot of moths and flies at the stadium. Misbah-ul-Haq looked very nervous and very un-like Misbah-ul-Haq innings comes to an end. Fullish on off stump, he tried to flick by taking a couple of paces down the wicket. The ball took the slightest of leading edges and went low to Styris at gully, he bent down and took a neat catch. Southee gets his third. Misbah-ul-Haq walks back shaking his head. Misbah-ul-Haq c Styris b Southee 7(31) Southee to Misbah-ul-Haq, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:14.3  Southee to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, fraction short outside off, Misbah-ul-Haq went at that hard, chopped hard into the ground, no timing at all as it rolls to the off side
PAKISTAN:14.2  Southee to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, Southee has not been full at all this over, drags this one down and Misbah-ul-Haq pats it to the off side

PAKISTAN:13.2  Oram to Misbah-ul-Haq, leg byes, 1 run, What shot was that from Misbah-ul-Haq? Under the circumstances, it was an ugly hoick across the line and he is lucky that he is still there, if NZ had gone for the review, they would have got Misbah-ul-Haq out there, they wasted one in the previous over against the same man and this time they don't take it, Llong got that wrong
PAKISTAN:13.1  Oram to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, good length on off stump, Misbah-ul-Haq moves his front-foot across, covers the off stump and defends solidly

PAKISTAN:12.5  Southee to Umar Akmal, no run, short of length and on off stump, Umar Akmal gets right behind the line to defend it back to Southee
PAKISTAN:12.4  Southee to Umar Akmal, FOUR!!, the short delivery gets big on Umar Akmal and looked like it went off the shoulder, Harper reckons it was a top edge and a leaping Baz had no chance as it flew high and to his right, the top edged pull giving Umar Akmal his first boundary and a fortunate one too
PAKISTAN:12.3  Southee to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, fullish and swinging away outside off, Misbah-ul-Haq mistimes the cover drive, it rolls wide of cover, Umar Akmal wants the strike and gets it

PAKISTAN:11.6  Oram to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, A wasted review that, Rossco unnecessarily went for it and NZ have one referral less, it was sliding down leg, going over and would've comfortably missed the stumps, Misbah-ul-Haq was shuffling across to work it to leg and the ball hit him high on the padReferral time: Looks not-out to the naked eye. Misbah-ul-Haq has been given not-out and Rossco is reviewing it. Easy and Misbah-ul-Haq will stand and bat on.
PAKISTAN:11.5  Oram to Umar Akmal, 1 run, tucked from middle stump line down to long leg, only a single

PAKISTAN:10.3  Mills to Misbah-ul-Haq, leg byes, FOUR!!, Misbah-ul-Haq shuffles across a lot and exposes his 3 stumps, looked like he got a bit of bat on that as he went for the flick, but the ump gave it as leg byes, beat fine leg easily

PAKISTAN:9.6  Oram to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, Misbah-ul-Haq did not play at that, pushed his bat inside and then left the gentle out-swinger alone

PAKISTAN:9.4  Oram to Umar Akmal, leg byes, 1 run, moves in to strike Umar Akmal high on the pad, down leg and Misbah-ul-Haq calls through for the leg bye

PAKISTAN:8.4  Mills to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, well outside off and left alone with ease
PAKISTAN:8.3  Mills to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, again, 2 in 2, full and Misbah-ul-Haq hits the bat with his pad as the ball whistles past the edge, not far away is Mills from getting that edge and Baz will be in business right away
PAKISTAN:8.2  Mills to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, Mills is bowling really well, pitches on off and Misbah-ul-Haq is beaten pushing inside the line, Misbah-ul-Haq is playing for the swing and this one did not come back in, it just straightened to beat the edge
PAKISTAN:8.1  Mills to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, short of length outside off, Misbah-ul-Haq has a watchful look at it and then lets it goAlthough Dan is out of the field with an injury and it looks like a serious one. Ross is the boss out there and he is the acting captain. They are well on top in this game and Afridi is seen shaking his head in the Pakistani dressing room. He is padded up and is the next to come in. He has a word with Waqar too.
PAKISTAN:7.6  Southee to Misbah-ul-Haq, 1 run, square driven, goes off the thick outer edge down to third man
PAKISTAN:7.5  Southee to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, short of length outside off, no seam or swing, Misbah-ul-Haq shoulders arms

PAKISTAN:7.1  Southee to Kamran Akmal, out Caught by Taylor!! Kamran you dropped Taylor twice and he made a robust 131, Taylor won't return the favor though. The birthday man can do no wrong and Pakistanis are collapsing like a pack of cards or as Sidhu would say the cycles are falling off in the stand. No footwork from Kamran Akmal as he drove at a full ball on off stump, the ball took the outer edge and went low to 1st slip who cupped the chance with no trouble at all. Taylor has lovely soft hands and he is one of the best there in that slip position. Waqar Younis looks sombre, while Southee does a Shoaib - goes off on his aeroplane celebration. End of Kamran Akmal's day - a day he would like to think it never happened. Kamran Akmal c Taylor b Southee 8(16) [4s-1] Southee to Kamran Akmal, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
PAKISTAN:6.6  Mills to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, a ripper of a delivery to end a double WICKET MAIDEN!!, almost got three there as the ball straightened past the groping edge of Misbah-ul-Haq, he hung his bat at it and is lucky that it missed the bat, wonderful bowling from Mills
PAKISTAN:6.5  Mills to Misbah-ul-Haq, no run, pitched up and moving away outside off, Misbah-ul-Haq lets it goMisbah-ul-Haq, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:6.4  Mills to Younis Khan, out Bowled!! The off stump goes for a walk. Goes cart-wheeling out of the ground. Mills is roaring in delight and NZ are well on top. Beautiful delivery to get the solid Younis Khan too. Swung back in after pitching outside off, Younis Khan thought it was there for the drive and lazily came forward, the ball viciously cut back in through the bat and pad gap and took out the off pole. Younis Khan played slightly outside the line as well. Full marks to Mills though for landing it in the right areas. Younis Khan b Mills 0(3) Mills to Younis Khan, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
PAKISTAN:6.3  Mills to Younis Khan, no run, tapped to the off side, it was again a rising delivery outside off
PAKISTAN:6.2  Mills to Younis Khan, no run, back of a length on off stump, Younis Khan gets right behind the line and defendsYounis Khan, right handed bat, comes to the creaseDan the skipper: Meanwhile, Rossco is captaining the side and Dan is seen hobbling off the field. He is sitting on a tempo and is being taken to hospital.
PAKISTAN:6.1  Mills to Shehzad, out Lbw!! Shehzad does not do full justice to his talent. He has a chat with Kamran Akmal before wisely walking off the field, without going for the review. Another Pakistani falls in trying to do too much with balls on off stump, they are all falling while working it to leg and getting trapped in front. Shehzad played all around it, the ball pitched on off and strikes Shehzad on the front pad, there was a question whether it was hitting him outside off or was it too high. Replays confirm it was neither and Mills gets his first. Shehzad lbw b Mills 10(16) [4s-1] Mills to Shehzad, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
PAKISTAN:5.6  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, lots of hesitation between Kamran Akmal and Shehzad, it was tapped to the left of How at point and Kamran Akmal wanted the single, Shehzad sent him back in time, a sheepish smile from Kamran Akmal
PAKISTAN:5.5  Southee to Shehzad, 1 run, square driven with a lot of power and a fumble at backward point allows a single
PAKISTAN:5.4  Southee to Shehzad, no run, Dan is off the field and is taking treatment
PAKISTAN:5.3  Southee to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, catch dropped!!, driven hard back at Southee, he stretched his right hand and the ball came back at him at great speed, it hit the hard part of the hand and went to ground, a tough chance and a single taken
PAKISTAN:5.2  Southee to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, Is Dan the Man down and out?, full marks for the effort though, a miscued pull shot from Kamran Akmal, Dan went to his right and the ball dipped on him at mid on, his right knee went boom into the ground and he landed awkwardly, the physio came out and Dan shooed him/her away. Not sure whether the beautiful Katie Stalker - who was the physio is out here. Dan looks to be fine for now and is continuing.
PAKISTAN:5.1  Southee to Shehzad, 1 run, Shehzad moves outside leg and tries to unsettle Southee, Southee keeps his nerve and follows him, tapped to mid on and a quick single taken
PAKISTAN:4.6  Mills to Kamran Akmal, no run, Kamran Akmal is not timing them as well as Shehzad and he does not find the way past a packed off side field

PAKISTAN:4.4  Mills to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, driven wide of cover, on the up, a single
PAKISTAN:4.3  Mills to Shehzad, 1 run, the old man - Scotty Styris dives full length to his left at cover and saves 3 runs for his side, it was firmly struck and his effort gets the appreciation from his team-mates
PAKISTAN:4.2  Mills to Shehzad, no run, full and outside off, Shehzad went for the big booming cover drive and it goes off the toe end of the bat towards the cover region
PAKISTAN:4.1  Mills to Shehzad, no run, good length delivery on off stump, Shehzad gets forward and pushes it back past Mills' rightAnother gem from Ramiz Rambo: Shehzad can play 10 different shots to the same ball. He is like a millionaire on a roulette table. Alan Wilkins responds: Even Sidhu would be noting that down, to which Rambo says, yea 'Sidhu too knows a few.'
PAKISTAN:3.6  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, good tight MAIDEN OVER!! from Southee as he angles one away on a fuller length outside off, Kamran Akmal drives to cover again
PAKISTAN:3.5  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, fullish on the stumps, Kamran Akmal gets forward and drives to mid off
PAKISTAN:3.4  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, punched off the backfoot straight to the fielder at backward point
PAKISTAN:3.3  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, superb cover drive, but unfortunately from Kamran Akmal's point of view he finds cover point
PAKISTAN:3.2  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, a stifled appeal for a caught behind, but NZ don't take the review, Kamran Akmal has a sheepish smile on his face, it was a short of length delivery that swung away, Kamran Akmal was trying to open the face and run it down, it missed everything and went past the edge, beautiful bowling from Southee

PAKISTAN:2.2  Mills to Shehzad, 2 runs, poor running from Shehzad and Kamran Akmal, flicked wide of long leg and all they get is a couple, that should have been a 3
PAKISTAN:2.1  Mills to Shehzad, no run, lovely delivery that, pitched on off and straightened a tad, beating Shehzad on the forward defensive, Shehzad came stumbling out of his crease and tried to poke at it, very close to the edge again, Mills looks to be in fine form with the ball
PAKISTAN:1.6  Southee to Kamran Akmal, 2 runs, nice cover drive, Kamran Akmal leant forward and drove it past cover for a couple to get off the mark
PAKISTAN:1.5  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, pitched up outside off, Kamran Akmal lets it go
PAKISTAN:1.4  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, moves in off the seam, hits Kamran Akmal high on the thigh pad, going well over the stumps
PAKISTAN:1.3  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, sweetly driven to mid off, with a full face of the batKamran Akmal, right handed bat, comes to the creaseKamran 'Horror' Akmal comes in. He dropped Taylor and now finds his side in a lot of bother. Can he make up for his earlier mistakes with the gloves and go on to make a big one?
PAKISTAN:1.2 Southee to Hafeez, out Lbw!! Hafeez has fallen LBW again. I remember him going that same away against Osinde in the game against Canada. Swung in the air, Southee's natural delivery is the out-swinger, this time he gets the in-dipper going. Pitched on middle and caught Hafeez on the shuffle. Hafeez is always looking to work the balls on his pads and missed, replays showed that it was clipping the top of leg. Pak lose one of their reviews. If that had been given not-out, the original decision would have stood. As Yuvi said, the UDRS is a complicated tool and needs a lot of tweaking. Hafeez lbw b Southee 5(6) [4s-1] Southee to Hafeez, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Review time. Hafeez has been given out. He had a chat with Shehzad and then took the review. Hafeez has to go. The original decision stands.
PAKISTAN:1.1  Southee to Hafeez, no run, Southee steams in and lands one on a good length on the stumps, Hafeez gets forward and pushes it to mid onTim Southee, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:0.6  Mills to Shehzad, no run, spectacular from How at backward point, punched off the backfoot and he flung himself to his right to cut that off, Guptill pats How on the back
PAKISTAN:0.5  Mills to Shehzad, no run, short of length outside off, Shehzad tries to pull, the ball hurries onto him and cramps him up, miscued to short mid
PAKISTAN:0.4  Mills to Hafeez, 1 run, a thick outer edge rolled along the ground and past the slip cordon, runs down to third man, a single
PAKISTAN:0.3  Mills to Hafeez, no run, pitched up and moving away outside off, left alone, definite out-swing for Mills
PAKISTAN:0.2  Mills to Hafeez, FOUR!!, that is a fine shot, back of a length outside off, Hafeez stood tall and knifed it on the up, over cover, the quick outfield makes the ball race away, Hafeez is off the mark with a brilliant shot
PAKISTAN:0.1  Mills to Hafeez, no run, beaten as Hafeez came forward to push inside the line, a walking shot as Hafeez stumbled out, the ball held it's line and grazed past the edge, just missed, very close, good start from MillsHafeez and Shehzad are at the crease. Hafeez is on strike. Mills will open the attackAbsolute carnage from Taylor and lots of stats as Taylor made merry on his 27th birthday. The Pakistani side just went through their motions during the last couple of overs and Afridi was seen holding his hands on his head and covering his face, unable to bear the torture. Will the scarring last? Or will the Pakistanis comes out with intent and make a fist of this? Certainly there will be some swing for Mills and Co. It will be Srivathsa who starts off.The match got off to an exciting start when Brendon McCullum swung a free-hit from Akhtar for a maximum. Akhtar responded back by sending back McCullum the very next ball. Guptill stroked the ball to all corners but How played a pain-staking innings. In walked Ross Taylor, who on his birthday, played one of the best innings of his career. He has to thank Kamran Akmal for this opportunity as he was dropped twice by the keeper and he made Pakistan pay by clobbering his 4th ODI century and his first ever in WCs. The Pakistani spinners stifled the scoring rate and it seemed that they could restrict NZ to a moderate total. Taylor then tore apart Shoaib Akhtar by smashing him for 28 runs and NZ were well on their way. The last five overs yielded 100 runs and NZ were propelled to 302/7. The Pakistanis will be very demoralized and it will take a special effort from their batsmen to chase this down. Join us in a short while for the run-chase.Ross Taylor: I struggled initially, I played and missed a few, a few chances came my way. At last, happy that it did pay off. One of our strengths is the power that we have down the order, it was a plan to start well and then capitalise. We need to bowl well and take some early wickets.Last five overs have yielded 100 runs, and the last 6 overs, 114 runs.4
NEW ZEALAND:49.6  Rehman to Mills, 1 run, Mills sprays it wide, Mills reaches out for it and slaps it behind point for a single, at one stage it looked like NZ won't even reach 250, but thanks to Ross, they have made it big and have posted a very challenging total of 302, this would do a lot of hitting!
NEW ZEALAND:49.5  Rehman to Mills, 2 runs, Mills comes down the wicket and lofts it over the bowler's head, not neatly timed but well placed between long off and long on, they take two
NEW ZEALAND:49.4  Rehman to Mills, FOUR!!, nothing is going the Pakistanis way today, Mills looks to come down the wicket and go over the top, gets a thick outside edge, goes wide of the keeper and down to the third man boundaryKyle Mills, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:49.3  Rehman to Oram, out Caught by Gul!! Oram was looking to make it three in a row, but credit to Rehman for dragging it short, Oram was on one knee as he pulled that, Gul in an unconventional wide long on position grabs the ball with fingers pointing up at head height, end of a fine blistering innings from Oram. Oram c Gul b Rehman 25(9) [4s-1 6s-3] Rehman to Oram, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
NEW ZEALAND:49.2  Rehman to Oram, SIX!!, two in two! Oram stretches forward, uses his height to good effect and lofts it over long off, the big man is rubbing salt out here!
NEW ZEALAND:49.1  Rehman to Oram, SIX!!, Oram joins the party now, Oram clears his front leg, clobbers it over long on, this time he got the height as well as the distanceRamesh Srivats tweets: It's Ross Taylor's birthday. Akhtar delivered the cake. Razzaq the candle. And Kamran blew it.
NEW ZEALAND:48.6  Razzaq to Taylor, SIX!!, Ladies and Gentlemen, Taylor has gone crazy! New balls please, coz this one has just been sent out of Pallekele, might have landed somewhere in the Indian ocean, he shuffled across, swung that over deep mid wicket, there is no way they'll get the ball back, you can't bowl high full tosses to a man who is murdering them in the evening glow.
NEW ZEALAND:48.5  Razzaq to Taylor, FOUR!!, Dhoniesque from Taylor, shuffles even before Razzaq bowled that fuller one, Taylor hammers it straight along the ground bisecting long off and long onTaylor seems to have damaged his bat, he is asking for another one from the dressing room
NEW ZEALAND:48.4  Razzaq to Taylor, 2 runs, this would have been another wide but Taylor goes chasing at it, goes off the toe end towards long off
NEW ZEALAND:48.4  Razzaq to Taylor, wide, full, well wide outside the off stump, pressure! That's pressure!
NEW ZEALAND:48.3  Razzaq to Taylor, SIX!!, the crowd have gone crazy as Taylor goes berserk! That's the Ross Taylor the world knows, not a very high back-lift, but no margin for error as far as the power is concerned, heaves it over deep mid wicket, Rossco is just tearing the Pakistanis apart
NEW ZEALAND:48.3  Razzaq to Taylor, wide, Taylor shuffles across and Razzaq spills one well outside off, left alone by Ross
NEW ZEALAND:48.2  Razzaq to Taylor, SIX!!, that's the best and the cleanest of all hits! Razzaq, the victim this time around, gets down on one knee and slog sweeps it over deep mid wicket, the ball goes over the stands and out of the park. Kamran Akmal is seen cheering the bowler, Remember, he dropped Taylor very early in the innings!
NEW ZEALAND:48.1  Razzaq to Taylor, FOUR!!, fuller and outside the off stump, the pundits call it a half volley, Taylor cracks it through extra cover, the ball goes rocketing into the fence!Abdul Razzaq [3.0-0-19-0] is back into the attack
NEW ZEALAND:47.6  Rehman to Oram, SIX!!, that's as clear a lofted hit as you can see in death overs, Oram didn't concentrate much on the elevation, but he certainly got the distance, over the leaping long off fielder and the last three overs have yielded 50 runs
NEW ZEALAND:47.5  Rehman to Taylor, 1 run, Taylor waits for the ball to come onto the bat, runs it down to short third man with a short arm jab
NEW ZEALAND:47.4  Rehman to Oram, 1 run, quicker yorker on the leg stump, Oram gets his front leg out of the way and drills it towards mid wicket
NEW ZEALAND:47.4  Rehman to Oram, wide, Oram gives Rehman a hint that he was coming forward, he sends a quicker delivery down the leg, Oram does well to keep his backfoot inside the crease and avoid the stumping
NEW ZEALAND:47.3  Rehman to Oram, FOUR!!, Oram dances down the track, converts it into a full toss, flicks it over backward square leg, poor fielding in the deep by Younis Khan, he should have stopped that
NEW ZEALAND:47.2  Rehman to Oram, no run, fuller one, not much air, driven back to the bowler
NEW ZEALAND:47.1  Rehman to Oram, 2 runs, Oram punches it with the full face of the bat towards long off, takes a coupleAbdur Rehman [8.0-0-26-0] is back into the attack

Goes for his almightly front foot pull/swing and goes over deep mid wicket, the ball lands in the first tier, gets to his 4th ODI ton, removes his helmet to take all the applause, raises his bat, Dan the man is seen all smiling at the dressing room, Akhtar is taken to the cleaners
NEW ZEALAND:46.6  Akhtar to Taylor, wide, things are going from bad to worse for Pakistan, Rossco the damager! Not this time though, Akhtar spills one down the leg stump
NEW ZEALAND:46.5  Akhtar to Taylor, FOUR!!, this is turning out to be a horrid over for Pakistan and Akhtar, poor bowling yet again, width on offer, Taylor reaches out for it with minimum feet movement and carves it over point, he moves on to 96
NEW ZEALAND:46.4  Akhtar to Taylor, no run, slightly back of a length, Taylor swings and misses!
NEW ZEALAND:46.4  Akhtar to Taylor, wide, pressure is telling on Akhtar, slower ball well outside off, Taylor watches it go to the keeper
NEW ZEALAND:46.3  Akhtar to Taylor, SIX!!, Take one more says Taylor, a full toss, slightly lower than waist height, Taylor thwacks it over the deep square leg fence, full swing of the bat and the ball goes way behind the stands, it would have been a six on any ground
NEW ZEALAND:46.2  Akhtar to Taylor, SIX!!, Don't bowl there to Ross Taylor says Alan Wilkins while Rameez Raja cooes, 'Taylor is tailor made for these situations'. Taylor swings across the line, the length ball has been dispatched over deep backward square leg, Taylor is turning the heat on
NEW ZEALAND:46.1  Akhtar to Taylor, FOUR!!, Akhtar tries a yorker, it goes horribly wrong, a low full toss well outside off and Taylor slices it over backward point, third man can't get there in timeShoaib Akhtar [8.0-0-42-1] is back into the attackThis is Umar Gul's best figures in World Cups, 10 overs, 3 wickets for 32 runs. Any bowler in the world would take that.
NEW ZEALAND:45.6  Gul to Oram, no run, loud appeal first up, turned down! the ball darted back in to the left hander and rapped him high on the pad in front of the leg stump, looked like it was sliding down, the height would have been a question too, the umpire says no, Afridi does not opt for the referralJacob Oram, left handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:45.5  Gul to N McCullum, out Bowled!! A slower one from Gul does the trick, it was well outside the off stump, N McCullum looked to swing that to the on side, only managed to get an under edge and the ball is dragged back onto the off stump, one bail is removed and that's all Gul needs, celebrates in his trademark style with his index finger giving N McCullum a send off. A little cameo from the elder of the McCullums ends. N McCullum b Gul 19(10) [4s-1 6s-2] Gul to N McCullum, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
NEW ZEALAND:45.4  Gul to N McCullum, SIX!!, Danny Morrison on air goes crazy as N McCullum sends one out of the park! It was a bouncer from Gul, N McCullum rocked back and pulled it over deep mid wicket, the bat speed was something to admire, gets it out of the sweet spot and the people on the grass banks at deep mid wicket have some catching to do
NEW ZEALAND:45.3  Gul to Taylor, 1 run, slower off cutter, Taylor steers it towards point with soft hands, easy single
NEW ZEALAND:45.2  Gul to Taylor, no run, fuller one, Taylor can't get that away, driven straight to mid off, they can't take a single, they should have, Younis Khan was at the edge of the circle
NEW ZEALAND:45.1  Gul to N McCullum, 1 run, fuller and angled in, N McCullum digs it off his toes towards mid wicketSimon Doull on the other hand has these few good things to say about the Kiwi side: 1) Ross Taylor is the hardest worker in the New Zealand side, he is the first in at the nets and the last to leave. 2) John Wright, the Kiwi coach - had a little session with his side at Ahmedabad - when if you hit out of the practice net you are out. This was done because he was frustrated with his batsmen getting out playing too many shots in trying to go over the top. That has helped Guptill who has become a more responsible batsman.
NEW ZEALAND:44.6  Afridi to Taylor, SIX!!, that's the Ross Taylor the world knows! One of his favorite shots, gets down on one knee and sends the ball packing over deep backward square leg, slog sweep at display, took it from outside off, and a disappointed Afridi takes his cap from the umpire and goes away
NEW ZEALAND:44.5  Afridi to N McCullum, 1 run, N McCullum works it wide of mid wicket, single taken
NEW ZEALAND:44.4  Afridi to N McCullum, SIX!!, that's sheer power! There was a man at long on, but N McCullum was sure of what he was doing, cleared his front leg, bent slightly to swing through the line, right out of the meat of the blade, the ball had just enough on it to clear the ropes!
NEW ZEALAND:44.3  Afridi to Taylor, 1 run, flatter and a wrong-un from Afridi, Taylor taps it towards mid wicket for a quick single
NEW ZEALAND:44.2  Afridi to Taylor, no run, that's one of his go-to hits, the slog sweep, looked to fetch it from outside off, no contact made
NEW ZEALAND:44.1  Afridi to Taylor, no run, slightly slower through the air, turns away a bit, defended down the wicket
NEW ZEALAND:43.6  Gul to Taylor, 1 run, short of length and on the off stump, Taylor chops it behind point for a single
NEW ZEALAND:43.5  Gul to Taylor, no run, not well timed again, the face of the bat turned as Taylor drove the fuller delivery towrads mid wicket
NEW ZEALAND:43.5  Gul to Taylor, wide, wayward stuff! Gul was looking for the in-swinging yorker, the ball goes sliding down the leg, Kamran ensures no further damage, wide called!
NEW ZEALAND:43.4  Gul to N McCullum, leg byes, 1 run, we have seen a lot of leg-byes over the last few overs, pitched up and angling down the leg, N McCullum fails to clip it across, goes off his front pad behind square leg
NEW ZEALAND:43.3  Gul to N McCullum, no run, Gul comes back strongly with one banged in short, N McCullum walks a couple of paces forward and ducks under it, Kamran collects
NEW ZEALAND:43.2  Gul to N McCullum, FOUR!!, that's delicately played! Didn't concentrate on hitting that hard, just opened the face and steered it between point and short third man, the ball neatly rolls away to the boundary, top shot!
NEW ZEALAND:43.1  Gul to Taylor, leg byes, 1 run, that one cut back in sharply, it was slightly short too, Taylor was cramped for room and rapped high on the pad slightly down the leg stump, Gul appealed for LBW but it died down quickly, the ball goes to point and they scamper through for a single
NEW ZEALAND:42.6  Afridi to Taylor, 1 run, leg-stumpish again from Afridi, tucked through square leg, Taylor retains the strike with that run

NEW ZEALAND:42.3  Afridi to Taylor, no run, Taylor cuts, but straight to the fielder at point
NEW ZEALAND:42.2  Afridi to N McCullum, leg byes, 1 run, big shout from Afridi, it was a slider from him, N McCullum was trapped in front of leg, it was clearly going down, the umpire turns it down and the batsmen sneak a single as the ball ricochets towards point
NEW ZEALAND:42.1  Afridi to Taylor, 1 run, given a bit of air, turned towrads mid wicket for a singleNathan McCullum, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:41.6  Gul to Styris, out Lbw!! That's as plumb as it can get! The Kiwis were not able to get the big hits going in the batting powerplay and Styris was getting frustrated, he had a couple of arguments with Afridi and the umpire and that may have made him lose his concentration, this was a fuller delivery angling in, Styris went across and looked to whip it to the on side from the off stump, he's trapped plumb in front of middle, there was only one way the ball was heading. Styris has a discussion with Taylor but seems like Taylor is convinced with the umpire's decision, there goes Styris. Styris lbw b Gul 28(37) [4s-1] Gul to Styris, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Styris has been given out LBW, is he reviewing it? Nope, he is walking back!
NEW ZEALAND:41.5  Gul to Styris, no run, Did that fall short of Kamran? It was a short ball that followed Styris as he made room, he was looking to slap that through cover, got an under edge, Kamran dived behind the stumps, and looks like the ball fell just short of him, Kamran does well to prevent the single
NEW ZEALAND:41.4  Gul to Styris, no run, Styris makes room again, drives the fuller delivery with full venom, can't get it past the fielder at extra cover
NEW ZEALAND:41.3  Gul to Taylor, 1 run, too full, off stumpish, Taylor gets an inside edge, straight onto his ankle, Ouch! That would have hurt, the ball rolls away towards point
NEW ZEALAND:41.2  Gul to Styris, 1 run, good bowling that, Styris makes room and Gul follows, no room whatsoever to carve it, Styris ends up pushing it to long on
NEW ZEALAND:41.1  Gul to Styris, no run, slightly back of a length, Styris looks to flash at it, does not make contact, it was bowled slightly outside the off stump and Styris couldn't make the most of the widthNew Zealand opt for the batting powerplay. Time for Rossco to cut loose. It's been an un-Rossco-like innings, the Pakistanis haven't let him get away with his on-side hits. What can he do now?
NEW ZEALAND:40.6  Afridi to Styris, 3 runs, was too close to cut, but Styris plays it delicately, allowed the ball to come onto him, just dabbed it wide of the keeper, short third man runs back, gives it a chase and prevents the ball from crossing the ropes
NEW ZEALAND:40.5  Afridi to Styris, no run, again, a bit of width, cut straight to backward point
NEW ZEALAND:40.4  Afridi to Styris, FOUR!!, poor bowling from Afridi, it was overpitched, there was some width on offer, Styris leant nicely onto it and drove it beautifully through point and cover, it will go all the way
NEW ZEALAND:40.3  Afridi to Taylor, 1 run, little bit of width on offer, Taylor drives it through point, just a singleAn interesting heated debate going on involving Afridi, Styris and the umpire Llong. May be about Styris running on the wicket, the umpire is making a couple of things clear. Styris, Llong, Afridi and Gul are talking animatedly. I heard Llong saying that: no one mentioned to me that they are taking the power-play. Lots of chaos. Finally they walk away and the game resumes. We have seen everything today. The second time that there has been confusion regarding the power-play.
NEW ZEALAND:40.2  Afridi to Taylor, 2 runs, fabulous running backed up by poor fielding and the batsmen get two more, it was worked away past square leg, Afridi is not happy with the fielding and rightly so

NEW ZEALAND:39.6  Gul to Styris, no run, it's been a game of edges! Styris chases a fuller delivery outside the off stump, played with a slant bat, under edges it to the right of Kamran Akmal, who surprisingly dives to save a boundary. For the record, it wasn't a drop catch, the ball fell well short of Kamran
NEW ZEALAND:39.5  Gul to Taylor, 1 run, wasn't too short to cut, but Taylor looks to go for it, ends up chopping it wide of the keeper to third man
NEW ZEALAND:39.4  Gul to Taylor, no run, fuller and outside the off stump, Taylor leans forward and drives it straight to the fielder at backward point
NEW ZEALAND:39.3  Gul to Taylor, no run, Taylor has faced 92 deliveries but he is still looking a touch out of sorts! It was a short of a good length delivery that, Taylor looked to play that away from the body, does not make contact, might have been that slower one too from Gul
NEW ZEALAND:39.2  Gul to Styris, 1 run, poor ball that, should have been dispatched by Styris, a full toss on the stumps, Styris decides to push that towards long on with soft hands, the batsmen thought of taking the second run, but they decide against it

NEW ZEALAND:38.3  Rehman to Taylor, 2 runs, top edge but safe! Almost a wicket for Pakistan, it was bowled a lot slower, Taylor went for the slog sweep, looked like he was a fraction of a second early, the top edge ballooned the ball up in the air, it falls in no man's land in the fine leg region, Taylor survives
NEW ZEALAND:38.2  Rehman to Styris, 1 run, flatter this time, not too full, Styris tucks it wide of the bowler who runs towards mid wicket to stop it
NEW ZEALAND:38.1  Rehman to Taylor, 1 run, a bit of flight on that delivery, Taylor works it wide of long onAlright, Sid takes a breather, time for me (Ajith) to take up comm.

Scott Styris for some reason went and complained to Harper about it. Simon Doull on air: 'At least it is better than biting the ball', while Wasim Akram says: Really silly from Afridi, don't do that, we need you for this WC.

Here are some thoughts from the great man as the players take a break. Some gems from Ramiz Rambo Raja on air: 1) He was referring to chacha as the 'universal chacha' - the Pakistani old man who is a regular at all their games. The funny thing is that even Ramiz does not know his name and conveniently calls him by that name. 2) That throw missed the stumps by a half a kilometer when a wayward throw went way over the stumps. 3) Stumpy be careful don't stamp the little kid - when the official mascot of this World Cup was playing around with a small boy.

It has been quite an eventful 16 overs and it feels like I have done some 30 overs of comm already.

NEW ZEALAND:12.3  Gul to How, out Lbw!! How is so plumb that he does not even opt for the review. He just walks back, bat tucked under his elbow. Gul's strength is getting it to swing in the air, that's what this one does, pitches on off and moves in the air, How had pushed his front leg far too across, could not arrest the movement, played across the line, missed and it would have gone on to hit the middle stump.

The ump tells him that he can't take the PP since one ball has already been bowled. A comedy of errors and Afridi is furious. Waqar Younis has a sombre look on his face. This is turning out to be an eventful phase of play already.

NEW ZEALAND:6.4  Akhtar to Guptill, FOUR!!, YK did his best to catch that, but he is no Colly or a Steven Smith, even those two would have found it difficult to catch that one, slower one outside off, Guptill went after that and the thick bottom edge flew past a flying YK who went to his right from first slip, it would have been a dolly to second slip, it would have gone at head height to the man if he was there

Once again it will be Srivathsa who is starting off proceedings.Today is the first game at Pallekele, not too far from Kandy. Both the teams are coming out with small kids in tow. We are all set for the national anthems. Pakistan with their bright green kit and New Zealand in their traditional black are waiting for the anthems to begin. First up is New Zealand's and Rossco is singing along vociferously. The others - most notably - Dan Vettori is just silent. Then comes the Pakistani anthem - wonderful melody too. Younis Khan - ever the patriot has his right hand on his heart and humming to the tune. So are Shoaib Akhtar and Shahid Afridi. Akhtar as he always does - pats the little child on his head in front of him and proceeds to hare across to the team huddle.Weather update: We may be in for a 'no-rain' day here at Pallekele, the sun is out, no threatening clouds in the vicinity. Game on!Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Ahmed Shehzad, Kamran Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Umar Gul, Shoaib AkhtarNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(w), Jamie How, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, James Franklin, Nathan McCullum, Daniel Vettori(c), Jacob Oram, Kyle Mills, Tim SoutheeNew Zealand have won the toss and elected to batAfridi: I am trying my level best to perform with the ball, the boys have worked hard. The boys know how important is our battting, hopefully we shall play well. Akhtar and Rehman are back in place of Riaz and Ajmal.Vettori: We are going to bat first, it looks like a dry wicket we would want to make the most of it. There is a little bit of grass on it, the bounce may be a touch inconsistent but we would look to play well. Jesse Ryder is out, Oram is in.I like the look of this new stadium, grass banks, lush green outfield and a speactcular comm/press box towards the pavilion. Hope the wicket is good enough to surpass our expectations.Pitch report: The outfield is lush green, the new ball bowlers would not like the fact that the outfield will be lightning quick. The pitch also has a tinge of grass, but it would still be a 'win the toss bat first' pitch feels Danny Morrison.Hope Ross Taylor comes up with a special knock on his birthday. We wish him luck and success, today and in the days to come.Hello folks, a warm welcome to the clash of the unpredictables, Pakistan take on New Zealand at Pallekele and it is needless to mention that both teams will rely on their spinners to do the job. Afridi has been in terrific form, more with the ball, while the middle order has also performed exceptionally well with the bat. Kiwis, on the other hand, would be hoping for the likes of Ryder and Ross Taylor to fire. This is Ajith, I will take you through the day along with Ganesh, Sid V and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be right back with more updates.by Ganesh ChandrasekaranPallekele gets ready to host its first ever ODI and the locals will be praying that rain does not play spoilsport like it did when the first ever Test Match at this venue (Sri Lanka vs West Indies) was washed out. It will be highly interesting to see how the pitch plays out and the tactics adopted by each team in this unfamiliar venue. Both teams are led by all rounders who play a crucial role with the ball. They have had a contrasting World Cup campaign so far. While Afridi has been highly attacking and leads the overall wicket tally, Vettori has been content playing a defensive role and has only two wickets against his name in three games. It could be of some help that both teams had met just before the World Cup in a six match series in New Zealand. Pakistan won that series 3-2 but it was a more comprehensive win than what the overall result suggests. Pakistan have carried that form into the World cup while New Zealand have been on and off so far. Those matches would count for very little when the two face off in a completely new arena.Pakistan:Pakistan have won all of their games so far and their captain, Afridi has been the inspirational force behind all three. He has been in irresistible form with the ball picking up wickets in quick succession to cause maximum damage and looks good for more. They will be hoping that the experienced Akhtar will be available to lend some more teeth to the attack. The shortcomings of the openers have been masked quite efficiently by the brilliance of Misbah ul Haq and Younis Khan aided ably by the Akmal brothers but they will have to pull their weight soon and there is no better time than the present to do so.New Zealand:New Zealand have beaten the minnows quite comprehensively but fell short against the spirited Aussies. The batting came a cropper against the Aussie pace attack but redeemed itself against the weaker Zimbabwean attack. Pakistan poses a different threat altogether as they are equally potent in both spin and pace. The batsmen will have to pull up their socks and be on top of their game to be effective.
In the bowling department, Tim Southee has been the star and NZ will be banking on him to get the early breakthrough. The Pakistanis are very good at milking the spinners and this is where Vettori and Nathan McCullum will have a crucial role to play. Attacking them early is the best way to go about it.Face Off: Vettori vs Younis/MisbahVettori is as experienced as they come but he needs to shed his contain first mentality against Pakistan and his battle against Younis and Misbah could prove decisive. Both batsmen rotate the strike efficiently and never allow the spinners to settle down and in the process get their eye in. Vettori will have to attack when either of these two come in and will consider it job done if he can send them back early.Head to head:Pakistan and NZ have faced each other four times in Sri Lanka and the honours are even with each team winning two apiece. Pakistan has got the measure of New Zealand in World Cups though: New Zealand won the first time they met in 1983, but after that Pakistan have gone on to win six matches. New Zealand will be desperate to set that record straight.Quotes:Misbah: It's really very good for a team that its captain is doing well, but other players are also required to play well, take responsibility and ease pressure off the captain.
Vettori: The game, like against most teams, is about yourself and trying to work out how you could actually get the best performance out of yourself because that's pretty much where we have let ourselves down in the past.
