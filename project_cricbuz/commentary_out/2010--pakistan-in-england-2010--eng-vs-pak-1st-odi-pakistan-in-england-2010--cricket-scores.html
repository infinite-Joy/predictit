Lets keep our fingers crossed.....9:45 AM local (2:15 PM local): There would be an inspection at 10:00 AM local. Lots of water still on the covers.Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the 1st ODI between England and Pakistan. The home team have been in rampant form and would like to carry the momentum from the Tests and T20s into the ODIs. While on the other hand, Pakistan have a lot on their plate at the moment. The mental scars of the spot-fixing scandal are yet to heal and amidst a lot of controversy, Afridi would be looking to pull his side together and dish out a good performance. Stay connected for the toss and team info. The start maybe delayed due to some heavy rains this morning. The groundstaff are hard at work as usual and doing their best to get things in order. We are still waiting for an official confirmation on the start time.The preview by Vishaal LoganathanAfter steamrolling them in both the T20s, England will look to continue their dominance with another stellar performance against an already embattled Pakistan team. England's confidence will be sky high and they will surely go into the match as favourites, considering both teams' recent on-field form and off-field events. Pakistan's captain Shahid Afridi has admitted that the morale in the dressing room is quite low in light of the spot-fixing allegations that continue to hound the 1992 World Cup winners. Afridi called for focus and was sure that once they have a victory under their belt, the squad's confidence would be back. How they will manage to draw inspiration and record a victory against the high flying Englishmen though, is anyone's guess.SquadsThe suspension of the three tainted Pakistan cricketers, who would have otherwise formed the core of the team, has lead to the call up of Asad Shafiq, who played his only ODI against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup earlier this year and Mohammad Irfan, a towering 7 foot left arm pacer, who will be making his debut. Pakistan will benefit from Mohammad Yousuf's presence and will look forward to making use of the player's experience while batting. The prolific batsmen will be depended upon to guide the youngsters and play an anchoring role in the middle. Even with the exclusion of Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir, Pakistan have a dependable attack. With the likes of Shoaib Akthar, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Afridi and newcomer Irfan, Pakistan will want their bowlers to reduce the pressure on their batsmen.The ODIs see the return of captain Andrew Strauss, who would have been ecstatic with England's show in the T20s and will have a much easier job motivating his team for the upcoming series. Steve Davies has replaced Craig Kieswetter and will be hoping for an impressive performance to repay the faith shown by the selectors. Kevin Pietersen's much publicised exclusion has drawn in some unwanted attention for the English, but they are currently on top of their game and will be hoping his exclusion doesn't prove costly. Ajmal Shahzad has also been roped in for the ODIs, and the quickie will look cement his place with a worthy performance. The team has a nice balance with a good mixture of experience and youth in all the departments and competition for places is sure to keep all the players on their toes and give their best.FormEngland have won only 2 of their last five ODIs, but that will not matter much as they clearly hold the upper hand after victories in both the Test and T20 series. Their overall record in ODIs this year though, has been good with 9 victories from 12 matches. The caveat though is that 6 of the wins came against minnows like Bangladesh and Scotland. They will thus relish a chance to play and beat a top team.Pakistan have had a disastrous year so far, with their form deserting them and the spot-fixing controversy putting them in the news for the wrong reasons. Their form in the ODIs has been nothing short of pathetic. They have only managed to win once in the eight matches played this year and that too against lowly Bangladesh. They will be fervently hoping to better that record and start with a victory.Pakistan aren't new to controversy and no one knows better than them to bounce back after plumbing to the depths. They have often let their cricket do the talking with some stellar performances in the past when they have been surrounded by controversy or experiencing bad form, but they will be facing a squad whose confidence is sky high and form is superb. How they will get themselves out of the mess they find themselves in, will be interesting. To do that they will have the very difficult task of stopping an England that look to have all bases covered.Teams:England (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Steve Davies(w), Ravi Bopara, Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan, Luke Wright, Michael Yardy, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, Ryan Sidebottom, James Anderson, Jonathan Trott, Ajmal ShahzadPakistan (From): Shahid Afridi(c), Kamran Akmal(w), Shahzaib Hasan, Azhar Ali, Mohammad Yousuf, Fawad Alam, Umar Akmal, Abdul Razzaq, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Asad Shafiq, Mohammad Hafeez, Wahab Riaz, Mohammad IrfanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
