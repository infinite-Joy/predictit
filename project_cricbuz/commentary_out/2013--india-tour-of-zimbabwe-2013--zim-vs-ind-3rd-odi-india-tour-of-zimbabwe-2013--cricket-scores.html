Michael Chinouya makes his debut."Kohli: "We're going to bowl first. All about pitching it in in the right areas. There's outside the leg stump be some help early on when it is chilly. It should get easier to bat on in the afternoon. We just want to continue playing good cricket. There's a calm energy in the dressing room. No changes for today."India have won the toss and elected to fieldHello and welcome to the third one day international between Zimbabwe and India at Harare. After having exerted their dominance in the first two games, the visitors will be keen to secure an unassailable 3-0 lead over the hosts. However, Zimbabwe fought hard in the last match and would be looking forward to keep the remaining games competitive. Toss and Teams in 10 mins. Stay tuned...Preview:India will take on Zimbabwe in the third one day international in Harare and look to secure an unassailable 3-0 lead over the hosts. While India have beaten Zimbabwe quite comprehensively in the first two matches, the hosts did well in the last game getting early breakthroughs and forming important partnerships that flustered the visitors for some time. They will be hoping to put up a better performance in the hope of making the remaining games competitive. India India put up a performance worthy of champions in the first two games of the series. While skipper Virat Kohli was the star in the first match, opener Shikhar Dhawan stole the show in the second ODI with a magnificent knock of 116. He was ably supported by Dinesh Karthik and their massive partnership helped India pile on a match-winning score of 294 after losing four wickets early on. The bowlers were equally good, particularly Jaidev Unadkat who picked up 4 wickets and put pressure on the hosts. The Indian batting unit has looked solid and well-formed and the only surprise so far has been the exclusion of Cheteshwar Pujara in the side. It is likely that the Saurashtra batsman might get a chance in the third game to prove his mettle in ODIs after stellar performance in Tests. The remaining batsmen, with the exception of Rohit Sharma, have been pretty consistent and will look to keep up their good form.On the bowling front, the young pacers have bowled a tight and disciplined line. Both Unadkat and Shami Ahmed have bowled well, making most of the opportunity that has come their way. However, it would not be bad idea to try out Mohit Sharma in place of Vinay Kumar, who has been the only weak link in the bowling department so far. Amit Mishra and Ravindra Jadeja have been good, if not exceptional, and India would be looking forward to assert their dominance over hosts again. Strength and Weaknesses: Undoubtedly, the Indian batting possesses a great deal of fire-power and all the batsmen are capable of playing match-winning knocks when required. So far, Shikhar Dhawan, Ambati Rayudu, Virat Kohli and Dinesh Karthik have put on big scores and look good enough to make more. As long as they concentrate on staying in the middle as long as possible, India will have no problem in putting up competitive scores. India only need to concentrate on bowling well in the death overs as their inability to take quick wickets in the final overs has resulted in the opposition piling runs. Although a settled batting line-up makes up for that weakness, this series presents a good opportunity for the visitors to fine-tune these small chinks in their armour. Zimbabwe In all fairness, Zimbabwe have fought quite well in the first two games but have in fact been outplayed by a much better team. The openers have looked in good touch with Sikandar Raza hitting a classy 82 in the first game and Vusi Sibanda making a fine 55 in the second. They have given Zimbabwe good starts but unfortunately, the middle order has failed to capitalize on it. Prosper Utseya, one of Zimbabwe's most experienced players, struck an aggressive 52 and along with Elton Chigumbura put up a fighting stand in the last game. However, the assault came too late as by that time the Indians had already got a firm grip over the match. They need their batsmen to fire in unison instead of individual performances and if the likes of Sean Williams and Brendan Taylor come to the party, Zimbabwe will not find it difficult to build up in the middle overs. Bowlingwise, the hosts have been very inconsistent, they have sparkled in the initial overs but looked highly lacklustre in the middle. Jarvis and Vitori were successful in creating the necessary pressure in the last game to leave India struggling at 65/4 but could not capitalize on this position as Dhawan and Karthik thrashed them to put an intimidating 167-run stand that ultimately clinched the game for the Indians. The inclusion of Brian Vitori in the last game boosted their attack as he bowled an economical spell picking up Rohit Sharma and Ambati Rayudu. However, experienced bowlers like Kyle Jarvis and Prosper Utseya going for nearly 7 runs an over have only hurt their chances against a mighty Indian batting unit. Strengths and weaknesses: Zimbabwe have a decent batting department, fresh from their series against Bangladesh where they put on a clinical performance. Even in the last two games, they have produced competitive performances and if the middle order chips in runs, they have a good chance of taking over the formidable Indian attack. In the previous game, Zimbabwe were undone by a very poor fielding performance that made things relatively easy for the visitors. Too many dropped catches, inconsistent line and lengths that resulted in too many extras and misfields cost them the game. The hosts need to lift themselves in both the bowling and fielding departments if they are to give themselves a chance of winning the third game and halting India's dominance.
