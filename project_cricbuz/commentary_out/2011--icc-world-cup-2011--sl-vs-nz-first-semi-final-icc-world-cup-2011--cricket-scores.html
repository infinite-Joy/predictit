SRI LANKA:47.5 47.5 McKay to Samaraweera, FOUR!!, SL are into the final of the 2011 WC. A fitting way for this topsy-turvy game to end, it was a peach of a delivery, squared up Samaraweera completely, he edged it to the left of Rossco who is standing at a widish slip, the ball goes in between him and the keeper, all the way to the fence, Samaraweera knows that they are through and pumps his fist, before hugging Mathews and MJ. The Kiwis are gutted. They have given it their all. Last game for Dan in ODIs too. What a player and a wonderful ambassador for his country. Take a bow Dan.
SRI LANKA:47.4  McKay to Samaraweera, no run, comical stuff and everything is happening out here at RPS, Samaraweera came down the track to pull, bottom edged it onto his back leg, Mathews wanted the single, Samaraweera sent him back, chaotic scenes at the end

SRI LANKA:47.2  McKay to Mathews, 1 run, an one legged pull to square leg, SL are a hit away from reaching their second successive World Cup final.
SRI LANKA:47.1  McKay to Samaraweera, 1 run, to third man, length ball but wide outside off, Samaraweera guides it to third manFirst delivery, over No. 48 - Well, chaos, drama, confusion! Samaraweera smacked that delivery for a boundary but Aleem Dar has signaled it a dead ball. He pulled it off at the last minute coz there were a lot of firecrackers that went off even before Samara hit that. Well, this could turn out to be controversial. SL need to do it all over again.
SRI LANKA:46.5  Southee to Mathews, no run, confusion and chaos all-round, Steve Davis has just confirmed that the 2nd ball was not a wide, after the 6 that is, everyone don't know what is happening out there, until he calls it over, miscued pull to mid wicket

SRI LANKA:46.3  Southee to Mathews, FOUR!!, Angelo has almost finished off the Kiwis, danced down the wicket, took it on a length, and then a nice free flowing blade, a couple of bounces and over the ropes, the crowd can now feel it, on an injured thigh and all that
SRI LANKA:46.2  Southee to Mathews, no run, looked like that it might have caught the glove on the pull, another dot ball
SRI LANKA:46.1  Southee to Mathews, SIX!!, Superman! That's Mathews' nickname, what a fab strike. Pressure, what pressure as Bumble says. Drifting in to middle ande leg, he cleared his front leg and thwacked it way over long on, Samaraweera likes it and punches the gloves in delightDan and Rossco - the vice captain have a chat. SL are in the box seat and should win this. If they hold their heads that is. Strange things have happened in this game.

SRI LANKA:45.5  McKay to Mathews, no run, short of length delivery on off stump, Mathews stands tall and defends
SRI LANKA:45.4  McKay to Mathews, no run, good delivery and Mathews was caught poking at it, he took the bottom hand out of the way as he played that, then looked back at Baz, they went upstairs, but Erasmus got it right, without the hot-spot or the snicko, very tough to give those. The crowd are happy and MJ has a word with Mathews, urging him to stay on.A loud appeal for caught behind, McCullum wants it to be referred upstairs, he looks pretty confident. Original decision, NOT OUT. The umpires are having a look at the replays. No clear evidence and Mathews will stay.
SRI LANKA:45.4  McKay to Mathews, 5 wides, poor bowling from McKay, back of a length and nipping further away after pitching outside leg, it bounces awkwardly just in front of McCullum and 5 wides for the hosts, the crowd know that it's just a matter of time now before they win it

McKay comes back on. The last throw of the dice from the Kiwis. If they can pick up a wicket, then the Lankans will be under massive pressure. A slip in place for McKay.
SRI LANKA:44.6  Southee to Mathews, 1 run, Mathews rode that short delivery well, stood on his toes, then made sure he rolled his wrists on it and softly pulls it down to deep square, retains the strike with that runA slip in place for Mathews as Dan still attacks. Good captaincy from the man. Afterall this is a semi-final at stake.

SRI LANKA:44.4  Southee to Samaraweera, no run, brilliant bowling from Southee, sees Samaraweera backing away, knows that he has one short delivery up his sleeve, follows him and just about gets it under his head, Samaraweera isn't impressed with the call, he reckoned that it was over head height

He is a calm customer and is known to steer his side home in tense situations. Will he do it today?
SRI LANKA:42.2  Southee to Silva, out Bowled!! The Premadasa's voices have been muted once again. Short and wide outside off, the drag on as Bumble calls it and it has taken out the leg stump, bottom edged cut and the ball bounces in front of his feet, before disturbing the bails. Southee has a smile on his face after that wicket fell. High drama here at the Premadasa. A beautiful face in the crowd can't believe it. Game on! Silva b Southee 13(25) [4s-2] Southee to Silva, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

The Kiwis have got the momentum and the Lankans with not much to follow - with Angelo not feeling well - will have a few butterflies in their stomach. Here we go. McKay to continue.With that, I, Sid V, hand it over to Srivathsa. This match is poised on a knife-edge now.

SRI LANKA:23.5  Oram to Dilshan, FOUR!!, poor fielding! Can you believe it? Guptill, the man. One of the better fielders in the Kiwi side, it was cracked hard to cover, Dilshan lets it through him, gives it a chanse but to no avail, looks like Dilshan is going to finish this off quickly

N McCullum will open the attackNathan who opened the attack against South Africa in the quarter-final and got the freakish wicket of Amla has the new ball. Ross Taylor walks up to him and sets the field. If the Kiwis can nip out a few early on, then they can put the squeeze on the Lankans. From then on, it will be a pressure game and the side who handles it better will triumph. A slip and a leg slip in place for Nathan. Here we go.All set for the Lankan chase and the openers are walking out. The Kiwis as the whole world knows, won't give an inch on the field. With the likes of Guptill, Kane W and the rest, expect plenty of scrapping, sprawling and diving. The new ball bowlers - Southee and McKay - will definitely get some swing under the lights and may trouble the Lankan openers. But the trouble with the Lankan pair, is that they are under tremendous form and if they get off to a good start, then the game could get over very quickly.Muralitharan: It will be a slow wicket and there is some turn, there will be some dew on the wicket and our batsmen should be able to do the job. This is the last game here, and I got the wicket off the last ball, like I did in Test cricket.From 192-4 to 217 all out - that's the story of the first half. The plan, which failed, was simple - play 50 overs. The openers started well but Brendon McCullum fell soon after. A few mini-partnerships followed but none of them converted it into a big one until Taylor and Styris got together. The duo added 77 vital runs in the middle overs before Taylor fell looking for a big shot. Styris continued to bring up a well made fifty along with Williamson, who played a few good shots on way to a quickfire 22. The kiwis looked set for a big finish but the deadly duo of batting powerplay and Lasith Malinga checked their progress. Disciplined bowling in the death overs restricted NZ to 217. Will it be enough? SL, like SA (against whom they defended 222) are top heavy in the batting line up. Or will Dilshan and Tharanga make a mockery of the total the way they did against England?

NEW ZEALAND:48.5  Ajantha Mendis to McKay, out Bowled!! Gone! That's the end of the sorry tale, fantastic from Ajantha Mendis, skids through after pitching, didn't turn a long way but McKay was caught playing away from the body, the ball goes between the bat and the pad, knocks the middle stump and that's it. 218 should be an easy chase, considering the form that the Lankan batsmen are in.

Well, he has himself to blame for attempting that kind of a shot, went a long way across trying to flick it behind square on the on side.

The physio is attending to him outside the boundary. He walks off the field, worrying signs.
NEW ZEALAND:42.3  Muralitharan to Williamson, FOUR!!, this is what I call, 'Playing according to the field'. Williamson uses his feet, gets very close to the pitch of the ball, lofts it over mid off, in the gap towards the deep extra cover boundary, fabulously done!
NEW ZEALAND:42.2  Muralitharan to Williamson, no run, quicker one drifting in, Williamson goes back and blocks it to the off side

NEW ZEALAND:39.1  Ajantha Mendis to Taylor, out Caught by Tharanga!! The first big shot that Taylor has attempted and it's led to his downfall. It was an un-Taylor like innings today to be honest. It was a boundary ball for sure, short, turning in, somewhere around the off stump and thereabouts, Taylor had all the it me in the world, may be the slowness of the wicket did him in, he goes back and pulls, only to find Tharanga at deep mid wicket.

NEW ZEALAND:33.1  Malinga to Taylor, no run, starts off with a fuller one angled in from wide of the crease, Taylor gets forward and pushes it to point, that was a quick oneThanks Sid. Time for Rossco to press the pedal on the accelerator. With Oram to follow, it shouldn't be much of a problem for them to go past 250. But, a couple of quick wickets may dent NZ. A drinks break will always upset the concentration of the batsmen, let's see what happens.With that, it will be Drinks. Both batsmen have really done well here after the loss of Guptill. Can they continue their rebuilding? Time for Ajith to take you till the end of the innings. I, Sid V, am off for a bit of rest.

NZ are doing it very well here. Guptill is the key now for the Kiwis.With that it will be drinks. The Kiwis are playing it safe and have strolled at a leisurely pace to 68/1. This was the same strategy that they employed against the Proteas and with the likes of Taylor, Oram and Styris to come, the stage is set for them to unleash at the death. Sri Lanka would be a tad worried that they have not taken more wickets. To tell you more, it will be Sid V who will tell you more. I, Srivathsa will go and have some lunch. Meanwhile, Realtime Thiru back after a three day vacation has slyly slipped into the scoring duties.

NEW ZEALAND:7.1  Herath to Brendon McCullum, out Bowled!! A false dawn and a false hope was all that Brendon McCullum created today. An ugly hoick to a ball that kept a tad low, he bent down to sweep and was too early into the shot, the ball missed his bat and hit the off stump. Herath pumps his fist and the dangerous Baz is gone.

NEW ZEALAND:2.1  Mathews to Guptill, FOUR!!, Murali is down on the ground and took an age to get up, flicked to his right at short fine, he dived ever so slowly, half stopped it, but the ball just trickled into the ropes, Murali apparently told Tony Greig that he was just 65% fit. No need to dive for those says Russel Arnold on air.Angelo Mathews, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackLooks like a definite strategy from the Kiwis not to give any wickets to the new ball. Both Brendon McCullum and Guptill are looking to play safe and if the ball is there to be hit, then they will. No rash strokes seems to be the mantra from them.

NEW ZEALAND:1.3  Herath to Brendon McCullum, no run, well tossed up outside off, Brendon McCullum gets forward and defends
NEW ZEALAND:1.2  Herath to Brendon McCullum, FOUR!!, shot, rocked back and pulled it away over mid wicket, it was dragged down short, Brendon McCullum was quick to latch on and power a pull. Brendon McCullum too like Guptill is off the mark with a boundary
NEW ZEALAND:1.1  Herath to Brendon McCullum, no run, shortish outside off, Brendon McCullum thought about the whiplash cut, then as it came slower to him, he tapped with a cross bat to the off sideRangana Herath, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attackBaz: Time for Baz aka Brendon McCullum to show what he is really capable of. He is an incredibly talented player. But like another of his past KKR mate, Chris Gayle, has not made use of his talent. He often gets out in trying to dominate the bowling without getting his eye in. Today is the time for him to fire and if he does, then the Lankans would be under severe stress.
NEW ZEALAND:0.6  Malinga to Guptill, no run, bang on off, Guptill brings his bat down in time and pushes it to mid off, a tight opening over from Malinga
NEW ZEALAND:0.5  Malinga to Guptill, FOUR!!, authoritative from Guptill and Malinga has a wry smile on his face as he walked back, just stand and deliver from Guptill, picked it from a back of a length on middle and then used his wrists to whip it up and over square leg, the ball screamed away to the fence, Guptill and the Kiwis are away
NEW ZEALAND:0.4  Malinga to Guptill, no run, pitched up delivery outside off, Guptill shows the full face of the bat and drives it to mid off, shouts waitinnnnnnnn to Brendon McCullum
NEW ZEALAND:0.3  Malinga to Guptill, no run, full delivery on off stump, Guptill gets forward and defends
NEW ZEALAND:0.2  Malinga to Guptill, no run, swinging from the moment it leaves Malinga's hand, on a short of length and moving away, it pitched outside off and moved away, Guptill leaves again, immediately Guptill is unable to pick the white ball from Malinga, so Steve Davis replaces his white floppy hat with a normal baseball cap, Billy Doctrove the third ump came in and passed on the hat to Steve
NEW ZEALAND:0.1  Malinga to Guptill, no run, good first ball or a good first cherry as Shane Warne would say if he was commentating, pitched up and moving away outside off, Guptill saw that well and let it go, some swing for Malinga, but Guptill had that coveredGuptill and Brendon McCullum are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Malinga will open the attackRight, fasten your seatbelts, grab some lunch and don't go any where for the big game is about to start. The Lankans are in a huddle. Sanga has a few things to say to his side. Mahela chips in with his few wise words of wisdom. The Kiwi openers are out there too. Some glove love between Guptill and McCullum. Malinga has the new ball. From the Khettarama end he will be steaming in. Guptill at the other end will face him. Umpire Steve Davis signals for play to begin.Time for the anthems: Both sides have walked into the stadium with little kids in tow. A wonderful occasion for both the sides. The crowd at the Premadasa are packed to the rafters. Brilliant atmosphere in the stadium. The Kiwi one is first up and Ross, along with Guptill and Ryder are clearing their throats. Dan, Southee and Big Jake are a bit more subdued. A smattering of Kiwi supporters in the stands. Next up is the Sri Lankan one - 'Namo Namo Matha'. As expected the home crowd are in full force. All sorts of Lankans in today - with body paints, a Malinga lookalike and lots of pretty Lankan women. It's a pretty long anthem. As it ends a huge roar goes up in the stands.Just a thought: Massive game this and the Kiwis have done well by winning the toss and electing to bat. Remember that the Lankans have not lost a World Cup game against the Kiwis since 1992. 'Murali on one leg is enough for me says Tom Moody'. Could be the last game for him, if the Kiwis can cause an upset. There will be some verbals between both the sides for what happened the last time - Nathan McCullum took a clean catch and Mahela did not walk. It was referred upstairs and shockingly despite clear evidence in favor of the Kiwis, Saheba ruled in favor of the batsman. So expect lot of sledging between the two sides today.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Mahela Jayawardene, Chamara Silva, Thilan Samaraweera, Angelo Mathews, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Muttiah Muralitharan, Rangana HerathNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(w), Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Kane Williamson, Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Jacob Oram, Tim Southee, Andy McKaySangakkara: Muralitharan is playing, we are going in with the same side. The wicket will play a lot better than it looks and it may bind well together in the evening.Vettori: This is a bat-first wicket and we would like to put a good score in front of a good Sri Lankan bowling attack. The performance against SA was great and we would like to repeat the same. It would be a tough wicket to bat on. McKay will be back in place of Woodcock.New Zealand have won the toss and elected to batMuralitharan: I played my debut game against India here in August 1993. This is the last game that I would be playing here in Sri Lanka and it is an emotional game. We will play to our strengths, going in with 3 spinners. At any cost, I will be playing this game. It would be nice if I can break McGrath's WC record for most wickets, but winning the game will be the priority. The Kiwis will come and attack, they are good players, and we need to bowl well.Pitch report: The wicket was used a couple of days ago, there are a few more cracks, the wicket will be a little more challenging than what we saw on Saturday. Batting first will be the way to go and the wicket may get slower as the game progresses.Weather report: The temperature is about 31 deg, it is bright and sunny, the humidity is about 65%. There is a high possibility of some rain in the evening.Sri Lanka and New Zealand also met in the semi final of the 2007 World Cup at Sabina Park. Jayawardene then scored a wonderful century to take them to the final.Russel Arnold feels the wicket will offer more turn but a minimum of 260 is a must for the team batting first. Simon Doull wants Oram to be sent up the order, so that he whacks the spinners, takes them on and unsettles them.This pitch will be the same one that was used for the quarter final game between Sri Lanka and England. So we expect Sri Lanka to go in with three spinners again. But, there is a cloud of doubt over the fitness of Murali. Knowing the champion, he would not want to miss out.It has now come down to the semi-final stage in the 2011 World Cup and the four teams that have made it here are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and New Zealand. We are here in Colombo for the first SF, where hosts Sri Lanka lock horns with the fighting underdogs - New Zealand. The Kiwis have never made it to the final of any World Cup, is this the day? Only one team can make it to Mumbai to play in front of a packed crowd on the 2nd of April. The experts say, Sri Lanka are favorites to go there but funnier things have happened in the game. New Zealand are clearly capable of causing an upset, to be honest. This is Ajith and I will take you through along with Sid V and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be back with a lot of updates..The preview by Gokul GopalWhile all the focus is on the India-Pakistan clash on Wednesday at Mohali, which is the most eagerly anticipated match of this World Cup, the battle of the arch-rivals can wait for a day. The India-Pakistan match is certainly not the finals and there are two more teams namely Sri Lanka and New Zealand who are keenly waiting for their chance to make it to the final frontier and also go past it.Head to Head: This is the second time that Sri Lanka and New Zealand would be taking on each other in a World Cup semi-final. The two sides had faced off in the 2007 edition of the 50-over tournament where Sri Lanka had won by a comfortable margin of 81 runs. Overall, Sri Lanka have so far played New Zealand 8 times in a World Cup match with the Island nation emerging victorious on 5 occasions while losing 3 times.Build up to the game:Sri Lanka: The co-hosts of the 2011 World Cup have lived up to their reputation as tournament favourites, making it quite comfortably to the semi-final stage. Barring a loss against Pakistan and the rain-affected match against Australia which was abandoned, Sri Lanka have routed the other sides they faced en-route to the final-four stage, including a thumping win against New Zealand in the group match. Their quarter-final match against England in Colombo might have been a close affair considering the home side were chasing under lights at the R Premadasa stadium, but Tillakaratne Dilshan and Upul Tharanga scored impressive hundreds to set-up a massive 10-wicket victory to send England crashing.
Coming to the Lankan batting, the top four have been the key contributors for Sri Lanka during this tournament. Dilshan heads the chart as the Lankan top-scorer followed by skipper Kumar Sangakkara, Tharanga, and Mahela Jayawardene. Between them, these four have scored 6 hundreds so far in this World Cup, thus outlining the fact that they are the batting pillars in the team. The weakness lies in the next three, who between them have only scored 210 runs so far. Mathews, Samaraweera and Chamara Silva are yet to shine in the World Cup, and if there is a top-order collapse then these three will be more than tested.
The Lankan bowling has been a disciplined outfit and the likes of Murali, Malinga, Kulasekara and Mendis have not let the opposition batsmen get off the hook. Murali is the highest wicket taker so far for Sri Lanka with 13 scalps followed by Malinga with 8. Dilshan has also had a instrumental role to play in the bowling department, containing the batsmen as well as picking up crucial wickets. However, Sri Lanka would be concerned with the fitness of Muralitharan who has a 50-50 chance of playing this game after aggravated a quadricep muscle during the match against England. With a boisterous crowd backing them and also with key players in good form, Sri Lanka will be slight favourites in this game but should be wary of the New Zealanders ability to upset the big teams.New Zealand: The Kiwis entered the World Cup after a tumultuous 2010 during which they were blanked 0-4 in the ODI series against Bangladesh, suffered a overwhelming 0-5 loss against India and also were at the end of a 2-3 series loss against Pakistan at home. The Black-Caps were perceived as a team which could be defeated easily and at the maximum were expected only to reach the final eight. However, the Kiwis have shown that they are spirited fighters and the inclusion of John Wright and Allan Donald in the coaching staff has worked wonders as the New Zealanders ensured a semi-final date by pulling off what might be termed as an upset, to choke South Africa out of the tournament.
When compared to the Sri Lankan top-four, New Zealand's main batsmen have been only average in the tournament, barring Ross Taylor, who has been the Kiwi main-stay. Taylor, in the 5 innings that he has played so far, has scored 288 runs at an average of 72 including the fabulous century he scored against Pakistan in the group stage. But the runs have not flown that frequently from the bats of Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill and Jesse Ryder, although it must be said that Ryder's composed knock of 83 against South Africa proved crucial for New Zealand's entry into the semi-finals. A combined effort from the top four along with contributions from the likes of Styris, Oram and Williamson is a must, considering the spin-heavy Sri Lankan attack which the Kiwis are yet to master.
When it comes to bowling, Tim Southee has been the stand-out performer for the Black-Caps, bagging 15 wickets at an average of 17. He has been well supported by Jacob Oram (12 wickets) and Nathan McCullum (8 wickets) even as injuries have plagued the Kiwi attack throughout the World Cup. Hamish Bennett and Kyle Mills are out of the World Cup and currently in the squad as their replacements are Daryl Tuffey and Andy McKay. One of these two might get to play against Sri Lanka and it is imperative that they follow the game plans that would sketched out by the bowling coach, Donald. Not to forget, the Kiwis have Daniel Vettori who has been their go-to man for a long period of time. Although he may not make much of an impact against the Lankan batters, who are known to play spin well, he would certainly curb down the flow of runs and keep one end tight. New Zealand have to come up with an all-round effort much better than what they did against South Africa if they fathom any chance of making their maiden entry into a World Cup final.Captains speak:This is the crunch game and if he can play tomorrow that'll be great for us. Murali and everyone is trying to get him fit enough to play, it's no use thinking about the final and saving him for other games: Sri Lanka skipper Kumar Sangakkara admitting that they would risk playing even a half-fit Muralitharan.
I think the reputation we have is that we can beat any team on a given day. But consistency has avoided us a lot of the time, so it's our big chance in the semi-finals to go one or two better: New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori, confident of the team making it to the final.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Dilhara Fernando, Rangana Herath, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Ajantha Mendis, Muttiah Muralitharan, Thissara Perera, Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Silva, Upul TharangaNew Zealand (From): Daniel Vettori(c), James Franklin, Martin Guptill, Jamie How, Brendon McCullum(w), Nathan McCullum, Jacob Oram, Jesse Ryder, Tim Southee, Scott Styris, Ross Taylor, Kane Williamson, Luke Woodcock, Daryl Tuffey, Andy McKayLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
