It has been a roller-coaster of a series. After the first ODI was abandoned, South Africa beat England comprehensively to take the second match as well as the No.1 ODI rank. The joy lasted only a couple of days as England fought back to even the series at the Oval and snatched the No. 1 rank. The two teams have now moved to Lord's for the 4th match of the series. The winner of this match will make sure that the series is not lost. Lot to play for then..Preview by Gokul GopalAfter a disappointing Test series and a loss in the second ODI, England finally managed to register their first win of the series against South Africa when they defeated the Proteas by four wickets in the third match. It was a good comeback by England and they will look to continue in the same vein, and having taken back the number one ranking in the 50-over version from the visitors, the hosts will be keen on retaining it and go 2-1 up in the series. The South Africans, meanwhile, will be looking at the loss as an one-off affair and will be eager to get back to their winning ways.What's happened so far:After clinching the Test series 2-0, South Africa extended their winning run in the ODIs with a convincing 80 run win in the second match at Southampton. The first ODI at Cardiff was a wash-out, with only 5.3 overs being bowled during which England managed 37/0. The hosts finally managed to secure a victory when they beat South Africa at The Oval. Asked to bowl first, England managed to bowl out South Africa for 211 with Jade Dernbach (3/44) doing the damage early on and James Anderson (4/44) cleaning up the tail. In the chase, England lost wickets early on and were also in some trouble when the middle order stuttered a bit. But the knocks of Eoin Morgan (73) and Jonathan Trott (71) saw the team through.The hosts: England have been over-powered by South Africa for most part of the tour but they managed to have their way in the third ODI to turn the tables on South Africa. The bowlers, especially Dernbach and Anderson, came up with a good effort to skittle out South Africa for a sub-par total in the 3rd ODI. It was this kind of bowling effort that was missed by the English in the earlier matches, and the hosts will be hoping that the bowlers continue their good work for the rest of the series. Ravi Bopara's inclusion has also helped the team as he gives the hosts an extra option in the bowling department. With the likes of Steven Finn, James Tredwell and Samit Patel, England have a relatively settled bowling unit. As far as England's batting is concerned, the form of the top-order has been a concern for some time. Alastair Cook has had a couple of bad games while Ian Bell has also not been at his best in the opening slot. The skipper will be hoping that he and his opening partner get back to their scoring ways and give the team a good platform. Trott and Morgan failed in the second ODI but they came back well to contribute for their team in a winning cause and will be looking to continue the same. While Bopara's bowling has been an added advantage to his side, his batting form remains a concern and England will be hoping that he finds form soon. The hosts will have gained some confidence after their last win and if they put in a combined effort like they did at The Oval, they definitely can take the lead in the series.The visitors: Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and JP Duminy - with this batting order, South Africa have in them a line-up that is capable of winning the match from any position. While the openers Smith and Amla have been scoring pretty well and are in good form with the bat, de Villiers and Duminy have not done much in this series. When the middle order is not in the best of forms and there is a collapse at the top, low totals are very much in the making, as was seen in the previous match. What has also not helped the team is that the likes of Dean Elgar and Faf du Plessis have not been contributing much. Skipper de Villiers will be expecting his batsmen including himself to get the game in order and help South Africa go back to No. 1 in the ODI rankings. South Africa's bowling department is not much of a worry as Dale Steyn, Lonwabo Tsotsobe and Morne Morkel form a lethal pace attack. Although Tsotsobe had an expensive outing in the last match, South Africa will not be worrying too much. Wayne Parnell and Robin Peterson are also bowling well and they add more variety to the bowling line-up. The South African team will be looking to put aside the loss in the third ODI and put the pressure back on England again.Upcoming milestones:1: James Anderson requires one more 4-wicket haul to surpass Darren Gough as the England bowler with the most 4-wicket hauls in ODIs.3: The number of wickets Morne Morkel requires to become the 9th South African player with 100 or more wickets in One-Day Internationals.Quotes:It's encouraging when we can right wrongs. We have guys with various attributes who contribute to different ways: Alastair Cook, is confident about his team.We didn't play good cricket at all. Most of our senior players got in and didn't make it count. Including me: AB de Villiers, after the loss in the 3rd ODI.
