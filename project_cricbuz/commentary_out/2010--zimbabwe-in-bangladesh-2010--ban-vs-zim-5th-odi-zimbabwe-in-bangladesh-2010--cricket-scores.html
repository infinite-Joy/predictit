Indecision cost Taylor dear whereas Mortaza managed to find some swing with the new ball to prize out Masakadza and Debengwa. Ervine and Taibu staged a recovery of sorts adding 95 runs for the 4th wkt as Zimbabwe put survival against the spinners as the main priority. The Bangladeshi spinners were tight as usual on a wicket which had very little assistance for them. Chigumbura tried to up the scoring rate but perished in doing so as Zimbabwe ended up with a under par score. The fact that there were only 7 boundaries and 2 sixes tells the tale of the Zimbabwe innings.Some late overs slogging gave the total some boost, but it will be Bangladesh who will be the more happy outfit going into lunch.
