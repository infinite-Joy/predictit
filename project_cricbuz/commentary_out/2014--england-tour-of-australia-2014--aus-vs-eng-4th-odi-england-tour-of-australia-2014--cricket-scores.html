First ball coming up....Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, George Bailey(c), Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), Daniel Christian, James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, James PattinsonEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Ben Stokes, Gary Ballance, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Chris Jordan, James TredwellAustralia have won the toss and have opted to fieldIf England lose today, it will be their 10th consecutive loss across all formats, equalling their record losing streaks in 1993 and 2001. Hello and Welcome to the fourth one-dayer at Perth. Don't go anywhere. We will update the toss and teams in a few minutes.For England, it is only a matter of pride. They have been searching for a win Down Under for a long time but have been comprehensively beaten in both the formats. With major players rested in the Australian side, this could be good chance for the visitors to grab a consolation win.High on the euphoria of getting to the No.1 position in the ODI rankings thanks to India's loss against New Zealand, Australia will be keen on retaining their top position today. Already having secured the series, the hosts have rested a number of important players including Michael Clarke. George Bailey will lead the team in his absence as the Australians will be aiming for another clean sweep.Preview:With the series secured and in the bag, Australia have rested a host of key players for the fourth ODI against England and after some initial confusion, settled on a fit-again George Bailey to lead in the absence of Michael Clarke. England on the other hand, will be hard pressed to stop Australia from coming another step closer to a series whitewash. It will be interesting to see how the new world number one ODI side deals without some of their most experienced cricketers, albeit against a team that has struggled Down Under all summer.Australia: No Michael Clarke, no Brad Haddin, no David Warner, no Shane Watson. Australia will do without their four most successful cricketers this summer as they take on England for the penultimate ODI at the WACA in Perth on Friday. It certainly makes sense to try out some other players, with the series won, but can the new players keep the momentum going. Australia shot up to number one in the ODI rankings after India went down to New Zealand in Hamilton, but a defeat in Perth could see Australia quickly go back to the second spot. However, Australia are seemingly more interested in trying out new combinations, hence the return of Steve Smith and wicketkeeper batsman Matthew Wade.George Bailey, struggling for runs and fitness, has been named captain. He was the man who led Australia in India and did a commendable job but against a better attack on bouncier pitches, Bailey has failed to find the same form.Key Players: Despite resting four seniors, Australia still have enough fire-power in their ranks to keep England low and deflated. The likes of Mitchell Johnson, Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh and James Faulkner have been instrumental in the invincible 3-0 lead and they will continue to haunt England for the rest of the series.England: ?Not for a very long time has an England team been humiliated like this. After Andy Flower took over as coach, he combined first with Andrew Strauss and over the last year with Alastair Cook to mould a fine, successful side. But this one summer in Australia has left the English bruised. After the Ashes debacle, England are now dangerously close to another whitewash. Cook has been left pondering his ODI captaincy but his players have backed their captain - whether that makes a huge difference to Cook's mental approach remains to be seen. But there is a ray of hope.England will be fancying their chances after Australia rested four of their top cricketers for the WACA game and would need to make the most of it. Key Players: Barring Eoin Morgan, who has scored two fifties and century in the three games so far, none of the other English batsman has fired consistently. That has been their biggest trouble. Ditto with the bowling department. Apart from Chris Jordan, the others have not looked like threatening Australia's batsmen. If England have to make a match of it in Perth, they will need the others to stand up too.QuotesIt would be great to end the series 5-0 and that is our goal but we've just got to take each game at a time and try and continue playing good cricket. - Steve Smith, Australia batsman Obviously we are very desperate to avoid that (losing record). It's not a tag anyone would like. You go into every game wanting to win it and we haven't done that this tour. - Jos Butler, England wicketkeeperTeams:Australia (From): Aaron Finch, Shaun Marsh, George Bailey(c), Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), Daniel Christian, James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Xavier Doherty, Clint McKay, James PattinsonEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Ben Stokes, Gary Ballance, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, Chris Woakes, Joe Root, Boyd Rankin, Danny Briggs, Michael CarberryLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
