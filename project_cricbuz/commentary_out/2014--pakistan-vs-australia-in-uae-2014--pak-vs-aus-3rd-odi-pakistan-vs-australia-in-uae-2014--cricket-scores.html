Pakistan have one last chance to regain some lost pride. Can they chase this total down? Or will Australia complete a clean sweep? Answers coming up...The situation was very bleak during the batting powerplay that Australia could only garner 9 runs and lost 2 wickets. Pakistani bowlers pulled things back with Tanvir picking up 3 wickets for 40 runs in his 10 overs and was well supported by captain Afridi, who chipped in with 2 wickets. Join us for the run-chase in a little while.At the end of the Australian innings, Pakistan will be the happier of the two sides. Considering Australia were 102/1 at one stage, restricting them to 231 will definitely put smiles back on the Pakistani players. Australia looked set for a big score when Warner and Smith were batting. However, Warner departed after scoring a fifty and the floodgates opened after that. Smith played a crucial knock of 77, but he also gave his wicket away in trying to accelerate at the end.4

We did not have a good start to the tour but the boys are trying hard each and every day. Hopefully today we will be able to turn things around. Umar Amin comes in place of Misbah. Wahab Riaz is not fit and Umar Akmal has been rested."George Bailey: "We will have a bat first. This looks like an absolutely beautiful wicket. We are very confident. We have played 2 good games but we haven't played a complete game so far. No area of concern but plenty of room for improvement. We have 2 changes. Lyon and Mitchell Johnson are out. Mitchell Starc and Phil Hughes come into the team."Australia have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "It is a beautiful wicket. It is hard and has a few cracks here and there. The winning score in the last 5 matches has been 247. But the par score for me will be around 280. Team winning the toss will want to bat first. Even if one doesn't win the toss, it does not matter because this pitch is a batting paradise," reckons Dean JonesThings are not pretty in the Pakistan team. Misbah has opted out of this ODI and Afridi will captain the side. The ever calm Misbah has decided to sit out of the dead rubber after being subject to heavy criticism in their second game. How will his absence affect Pakistan? Can Afridi inspire them? Hello and welcome to the 3rd ODI at Abu Dhabi. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates...Pakistan have played 3 games against Australia, one T20I and two ODIs, they have lost all the matches without putting up a fight. Though the bowling has looked good, it is their batting that has let them down. In the previous ODI, the openers provided them a fabulous start - 126 in 25 overs - but in the next 25, the batting collapsed and they folded for 215. The wicket helped the spinners, but Maxwell played a fine innings to make things easy for the visitors.PreviewWith Pakistan having already lost the first two games of the ODI series against Australia, the third match to be played at Abu Dhabi turns out to be a dead rubber. Pakistan's batsmen especially, Ahmed Shehzad and Sarfraz Ahmed put Australian bowlers under some pressure in the second game, but in the end, a total of 215 proved to be inadequate. Australia though, yet again put up a thoroughly professional performance to win the series.AustraliaGlenn Maxwell turned out to be the star performer for Australia in the second game. With his wide range of shots he kept the bowlers guessing. It has to be said that by playing across the line, Maxwell was living dangerous, but thankfully for him, both Shahid Afridi and the part-timer, Shehzad, didn't have a googly up their sleeve. But that is how Maxwell plays and he won't change his game.Rest of the batsmen toiled hard though, they found runs hard to come by against Pakistan's spinners. George Bailey took 68 deliveries for 28, but the Australian captain would at least be happy that he got a few runs under his belt.Australia's bowling was yet again incisive. Mitchell Johnson bowled with pace and aggression to take three wickets. Kane Richardson, James Faulkner, Xavier Doherty and Nathan Lyon all chipped in with wickets.PakistanThe openers, Shehzad and Sarfraz gave the hosts an excellent start. However, once both the batsmen got out, they just couldn't recover. It turned out to be a familiar collapse, with Pakistan losing their last seven wickets for a mere 56 runs.The bowlers bowled well in patches, but in the absence of Saeed Ajmal, they lack a wicket-taker. The spinners, Afridi, Zulfiqar Babar and Hasan Raza put up a spirited effort, but Maxwell's pyrotechnics proved to be the telling difference in the end. Pakistan though, did show sparkles of brilliance in the field. In particular, the run out effected by Shehzad to dismiss Bailey showed that Pakistan are working hard on their fielding. As the third game turns out to be a dead rubber, they have to play for pride now.Quotes:I am pretty satisfied with the performance, especially after the start from the Pakistan openers. Our bowlers did a wonderful job to drag it back to 215. We knew it would get harder and harder to bat on. But, it was a great knock from Maxi (Maxwell). Teams are challenging us by preparing wickets that turn, we have responded well. It's something we are working on. We still have not played the perfect game or the complete game, but it is a nice position to be in: George Bailey.I think it was a poor display in the last 25 overs. If we had batted normally, we would have got to 250, which could have been defendable. We had some irresponsible run-outs. We have to bat well. By scoring, 160 or 200, we can't win matches. There were a few positives, especially the openers and Asad Shafiq. Babar bowled really well. We can take these positives into the Tests: Misbah-ul-HaqTeams:Australia (From): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Kane Richardson, Xavier Doherty, Nathan Lyon, Sean Abbott, Mitchell Starc, Phillip HughesPakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Asad Shafiq, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Fawad Alam, Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Raza Hasan, Zulfiqar Babar, Mohammad Irfan, Junaid Khan, Umar Amin, Sohaib Maqsood, Anwar AliLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
