There is some green tinge and there could be help for the seamers. It is very difficult to make something as elaborate as this in the mountains. Credit to the local cricket association. We will not be playing a lot of ODIs in the near future. We need to work on our death bowling. I think the track will remain the same overall. No changes to our team."Cook: "We're going to have a bowl first. This is an incedible place to play cricket. We have not quite been our best in the last couple of games but we want to do better here. Woakes comes in for Dernbach."England have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch report: The pitch is a little damp but it is also flat and very hard. The seamers will get good bounce throughout the day and movement as well reckon Ravi Shastri and Paul Collingwood.Hello and welcome everyone. The conditions are bright and sunny at the picteruesque Dharamashala ground. There is a sizeable crowd in already. The match itself poses an opportunity for many fringe players to get a game out in the middle. It'll be interesting to see who India rest if they do want to give the likes of Cheteshwar Pujara some game time. England have a young squad as well. Looking back, a 3-2 scoreline will look better than 4-1. That will be driving them to go home on a winning note. Stay tuned, the toss and team updates are coming up very soon.Preview by PradeepInternational cricket has reached the beautiful shores of Dharamsala as England wound up their split tour of India with the final ODI. The series has been bolted with India securing the trophy with a convincing victory at Mohali on Wednesday, but both the sides will look to end the series on a high note. The picturesque stadium at Dharamsala, surrounded by the beautiful Himalayan mountains will play host to its 1st ever international match after having hosted a handful of IPL games. The venue, Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium, is set at an altitude of 1457 metres and offers one of the best views for spectators. It is against this background that the two teams tee-off one final time in the series. India have shown glimpses of the kind of form that saw them lift the World Cup in 2011. The batting has not revolved around any single player with contributions coming from the entire batting order. Ishant Sharma has improved as the series has progressed while the emergence of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shami Ahmed has boosted the pace department. With the series won, the players will be under lesser pressure, something that might help them to give their best at the last. England have not gelled well as a team despite a surprise result in Rajkot. Their batsmen have evidently struggled against spin. Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen have shone in patches, but the find of the tour has been Joe Root. After having impressed the pundits with his technique and temperament during the Nagpur Test, Root displayed the other side of his batsmanship with a crafty innings at Mohali. Steven Finn has led the bowling department admirably but has lacked support from the other end. James Tredwell, only in as a replacement for the resting Graeme Swann has done himself no harm with some consistent performances. England have not enjoyed touring India for the shorter forms of the game but they would like to leave the country on a winning note. Team News: Dhoni has played the ODI series in pain after suffering a blow during practise before the Ranchi ODI. With the series won, it would be prudent for the Indian skipper to take a break. There has been no wicket-keeper replacement named in the squad though. Ashok Dinda might get a game instead of Ishant Sharma. Will Cheteshwar Pujara get a game? Stuart Meaker might replace the injured Tim Bresnan in the England eleven. Quotes: I am glad he scored runs because he is one of the most god-gifted talents that is around - MS Dhoni was full of praise for the way Rohit Sharma batted in the Mohali ODI. Apparently the umpires were pretty clear that they had told us that so I must have been deaf when I was listening to them - Alastair Cook is not exactly happy with the way the umpires handled Finn's dead ball incident in Mohali.Teams:India (From): Gautam Gambhir, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Shami Ahmed, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Ashok Dinda, Amit MishraEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Eoin Morgan, Samit Patel, Joe Root, Jos Buttler(w), Tim Bresnan, James Tredwell, Steven Finn, Jade Dernbach, Stuart Broad, Stuart Meaker, Danny Briggs, Craig Kieswetter, Chris WoakesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
