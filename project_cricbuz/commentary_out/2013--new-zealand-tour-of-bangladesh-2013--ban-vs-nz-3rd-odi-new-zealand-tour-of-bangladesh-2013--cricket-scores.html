They were sent in to bat by Mushfiqur and they have done well to get a big score on the board. They were led by Taylor who got his 8th ODI hundred and was superb in pacing his innings. He was well supported by Munro who scored a brilliant 85 and was the aggressor in the partnership. The Bangladesh bowlers did not get much help from this wicket as they got in Mirpur and they were not able to contain Taylor in the death overs. It is now upto their batsmen to chase down this target, if they have to win it 3-0. New Zealand have a very good chance of winning this match and finally breaking the jinx in Bangladesh.

You will not get good bounce from it. The toss will be interesting and I reckon, it will be a good toss to lose', says Danny Morrison.Hello and welcome to the final ODI. The hosts have taken an unassailable lead of 2-0 in the series. But there is still a lot to play for in the third match. Bangladesh will be hoping that they go onto win the series 3-0 and make it a whitewash. If they play the way they have played the last two matches can't see why that cannot happen. New Zealand are still searching for that elusive win in Bangladesh, they have now not won the last 6 matches. Hopefully a change in venue will change their fortune. But today they are without their skipper Brendon McCullum who flew back home with a back trouble.
