On the other hand, Calum MacLeod has been short of runs. Malinga to open the attack for Sri Lanka. Two slips in placeWelcome back.. It's a tough chase for Scotland. They have acquitted themselves well in this tournament so far but haven't had a positive result to show for it. With no pressure, this is another chance to show their class and ability..Dilshan: "I want to carry on this form for the next few games. If I get a start, I try to bat as long as possible. I had a chat with Marvan (Atapattu) and coaching staff as well. Great experience with Kumar (Sangakkara), he is a great player, both together we have more than fifteen 100 plus partnerships in the last few years. He is supporting me in the middle. Hopefully, we can forge more partnerships in the middle. If I'm scoring runs like now, I will carry on for a few more years. I'm enjoying my cricket at the moment and we will see after the World Cup where I can end up my career."The Scottish bowlers were taken to the cleaners, but they will at least be happy with how they came back at the end. Otherwise, things would have been far worse for them. Also, not to forget they had a mixed day in the field, dropping a few chances, while taking a few difficult ones. Rob Taylor and Richie Berrington were the pick of the bowlers. Even though they didn't take the majority of the wickets, they didn't let the Sri Lankan batsmen dictate terms when they were bowling. Apart from them, Davey took 3 wickets, Evans took 2 and Machan chipped in with 1. It is going to be very difficult for Scotland to chase this down, but who knows if there's a surprise in store for us. The pitch is flat and very good for batting. Take a break and join us in a short while for the run-chase.Captain Mathews and Kusal Perera, who were new at the crease, never let the aggressive intent fade away as both of them kept going after the bowling. Sri Lanka managed 57/3 from the batting powerplay, but both of them didn't stop there. They kept going after the bowling before Kusal Perera fell for a 13-ball 24. Mathews carried on his show and hit Machan for 4 consecutive sixes to notch up the second fastest fifty of this World Cup. However, he also perished off the very next ball, trying to make it 5 sixes in a row. Since then, batters came and went as Sri Lanka kept pushing for more runs towards the fag end of the innings. However, they lost 4 wickets in a space of 10 runs and that helped Scotland pull things back. Kulasekara hit a few lusty blows at the end and Sri Lanka finished with 363, the highest total against Scotland in an ODI.At one stage both of them were on 99, but Dilshan was the first one to reach the landmark as he registered his 22nd ODI ton, his 4th in World Cups as well. After that came the big moment as Sangakkara became the first cricketer to hit 4 successive ODI hundreds. He also became the first man to score 4 hundreds in a single edition of the World Cup. Both Sanga and Dilshan then decided to take the batting powerplay in the 35th over. Sri Lanka didn't get off to the best of starts in the powerplay as Dilshan holed out to mid-off in the first over itself. Sanga then took the onus of going big and took 24 runs off Evans' 7th over, where he hit him for a six and 4 fours. While trying to make the maximum of the field restrictions, both Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara perished off consecutive deliveries, leaving Sri Lanka at 245/4 at the end of the 37th over. Davey, who took both those wickets, overtook Boult and became the highest wicket-taker of the tournament.Sri Lanka didn't get off to the best of starts as Thirimanne went back early, trying to flash a drive against Evans. Dilshan was then joined by Sangakkara, who was chasing history, trying to become the first man to hit four consecutive tons in ODIs. Both the batsmen were then looking to stabilize the innings as they kept chipping away with singles, managing to put 46 on the board after 10 overs. After both Dilshan and Sanga got their eye in, both of them started dispatching the poor balls to the fence. The duo reached their fifties in quick succession and then decided to take the attack to the opposition, showing great footwork as they kept lofting the bowlers over the infield. The Scottish bowlers were not up to the task as both batsmen looked as if they were having a race between themselves so as to who reaches his hundred first.4

SRI LANKA:48.5 Coetzer to N Kulasekara, SIX, half-volley on the stumps, Kulasekara presented the full face of the bat and played a copybook front foot loft, straight back over the bowler's head. Went all the way. Held the pose too - one for the cameramen to latch and get their lenses into action, click away now!
SRI LANKA:48.4 Coetzer to N Kulasekara, FOUR, that's what he was aiming for the last ball, makes room and goes inside-out, on a bent knee, all the fielders are inside the ring and Kulasekara made full use of that
SRI LANKA:48.3 Coetzer to N Kulasekara, no run, why did the square leg ump go upstairs? Not needed at all. A waste of time. Kulasekara hadn't moved anywhere, he backed away and missed the inside-out shot over cover, missed and Cross whipped the bails off, Kulasekara's feet were firmly planted inside the crease
SRI LANKA:48.2 Coetzer to Dushmantha Chameera, 1 run, low full toss outside off, wristed straight to the fielder at backward square leg, for a singleKyle Coetzer [4.0-0-27-0] is back into the attackGood news. Berrington is back on his feet. That's heart-warming news from a Scottish point of view. He was in pain when he fell down, what do we have here? He is walking off the field with the physio. Gets a pat on the shoulder from someone, in the team management. The shoe ripped off while he was about to deliver the ball and made him land awkwardly on the left-ankle. After a bit of treatment, he is able to get up and walk off without showing any pain. Even manages a smile as he goes off
SRI LANKA:48.1 Berrington to N Kulasekara, 1 run, what has Berrington done here? He is in pain and has landed awkwardly on his left-ankle. The shoe came off as he was about to deliver and he couldn't land properly. The ankle took a pounding and we have a slight break in play. The physio is out there, tending to the bowler. Kulasekara drove that to long-off, for a single
SRI LANKA:47.6 Alasdair Evans to Dushmantha Chameera, no run, pitched up outside off, wristed straight to the fielder at mid-on
SRI LANKA:47.5 Alasdair Evans to Dushmantha Chameera, 2 runs, now plays a good-looking shot, over mid-on, very full and he lofted it over the fielder, the fielder runs back and keeps it to two
SRI LANKA:47.4 Alasdair Evans to Dushmantha Chameera, 2 runs, pitched up outside off, Chameera mishits the slice, but gets enough bat on that, to clear the off-side ring, the ball falls in no-man's land and that will be the first runs for Chameera in World Cups
SRI LANKA:47.3 Alasdair Evans to Dushmantha Chameera, no run, back of a length outside off, Chameera goes on the back foot and wrists it to mid-on, wants a quick single, but the ball has gone straight to the fielderHave to give it to Mommsen.

SRI LANKA:46.5 Berrington to Malinga, out Caught by M A Leask!! Now he can smile. Slower one outside off, Malinga wanted to go over cover, but the weight was on the back foot. Sliced it completely, point ran back and then hung on. It was in the air for a good while, which made the catch easier, despite the fielder having to run back and circle around the ball. Malinga c M A Leask b Berrington 1(3)Berrington to Malinga, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:46.4 Berrington to N Kulasekara, 1 run, that is a tough chance, but will go down as a drop. Low full toss, Kulasekara sliced the drive, but hit it hard, and to Berrington's left, the bowler was in his followthrough, reacted, got both hands, but couldn't cling on. Disappointment for Berrington
SRI LANKA:46.3 Berrington to Malinga, 1 run, tries to slap through the off-side, but drags it to mid-off, quick single taken
SRI LANKA:46.2 Berrington to Malinga, no run, the off-cutter from Berrington, stops on Malinga, who was early into the cut, the inside edge runs to short mid-wicket, no chance of a single even as the batsmen contemplated that thought
SRI LANKA:46.1 Berrington to N Kulasekara, 1 run, yorker length outside off, Kulasekara opens the face of the bat and squeezes it to sweeper cover
SRI LANKA:45.6 Alasdair Evans to N Kulasekara, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Kulasekara drives it to extra cover, retains the strike with that run
SRI LANKA:45.5 Alasdair Evans to N Kulasekara, no run, looked like the cutter, it nips back in and beats Kulasekara's attempted punch through the off-side, beats the inside edge and taken on the bounce by the keeper
SRI LANKA:45.5 Alasdair Evans to N Kulasekara, wide, down leg, called wideLasith Malinga, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:45.4 Alasdair Evans to S Prasanna, out Caught by Coleman!! Despite a couple of drops in the field, Scotland have caught well. Coleman coming from deep mid-wicket and hanging onto a low chance. His third catch of the innings. Prasanna was hurried on the pull and top-edged it as he rocked back to essay the shot, it seemed to be falling short, but Coleman had the plot of the ball tracked and came forward and took it. Evans gets his second wicket. S Prasanna c Coleman b Alasdair Evans 3(5)Alasdair Evans to S Prasanna, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:45.3 Alasdair Evans to N Kulasekara, leg byes, 1 run, down leg, on a short of length, Kulasekara went for the pull, but didn't connect, off the thigh pad and it's a leg bye

SRI LANKA:45.1 Alasdair Evans to S Prasanna, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Prasanna gets inside the line and nudges it to backward square leg, for a singleAlasdair Evans [8.0-0-64-1] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:44.4 Berrington to T Perera, out Caught by Coleman!! Scotland are taking wickets, despite leaking runs. Typical Perera slog, to leg, after clearing his front leg, these are big boundaries and Perera finds the man placed at deep square leg, who takes another well-judged catch to his left. The bowler followed the path of the ball and then clapped the fielder for taking it. It was taken with fingers pointed upwards. T Perera c Coleman b Berrington 7(11)Berrington to T Perera, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

SRI LANKA:43.6 Machan to Mathews, out Caught by Coleman!! That is a good catch at the edge of the rope by the fielder. Held his composure and took it above his head. Mathews went for more glory, took on the full toss and hit it well, but hit it a bit too flat for one's liking, he didn't get the required elevation on the hit and it was caught by the fielder at deep mid-wicket. The bowler must have thought it was another six when the ball went off the bat, but relief in the end. The ball was going over the head of the fielder, who arched backwards and took it even as he was losing balance. Checked his footing after taking the catch and he was inside the field of play. That is a big wicket, too for Mathews could've hurt Scotland no end. Mathews c Coleman b Machan 51(21) [4s-1 6s-6]Machan to Mathews, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:43.5 Machan to Mathews, SIX, this is buffet bowling from Machan and Mathews brings up his fifty. It was floated up on middle and leg, Mathews slogs it high and over cow corner, the fielder watches it sail over his head. He is doing heavy damage here, Mathews
SRI LANKA:43.4 Machan to Mathews, SIX, Machan goes over the wicket, but the result remains the same. Low full toss on off, Mathews gets his front foot out of the way, he slugs it over deep mid-wicket, for the third six in a row. Good catch in the crowd
SRI LANKA:43.3 Machan to Mathews, SIX, this is poor bowling from Machan, full toss on middle and leg, Mathews hoicks it over deep mid-wicket, that is too easy for the Sri Lankan skipper
SRI LANKA:43.2 Machan to Mathews, SIX, monster hit! Machan stays round the wicket for Mathews, fires it full and on leg-stump, Mathews clears his front leg and heaves it over deep mid-wicket, the ball had plenty of air time, but cleared the rope easily
SRI LANKA:43.1 Machan to T Perera, 1 run, tossed up around off, Perera leans forward and nudges it wide of mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:42.6 Rob Taylor to T Perera, 1 run, in the air and just in front of long-off, running in and to his right, Perera looking to heave that in the air, and mistimed that completely. Luckily he got away

SRI LANKA:41.5 Machan to T Perera, no run, shortish on middle, backs away and cuts straight to the fielder at cover-point
SRI LANKA:41.4 Machan to Mathews, 1 run, another dropped catch. Mathews is early into the flick, leading edge was found, Machan is late to react and the ball bursts through his hands, it was coming straight at his face and it went away, so Scotland let themselves down in the field as well
SRI LANKA:41.3 Machan to Mathews, 2 runs, that's dropped by Coleman at deep mid-wicket. Slogged high in the air, deep mid-wicket runs forward and tries to take it, but he fails to take it. That should've been taken
SRI LANKA:41.2 Machan to T Perera, 1 run, down leg, flicked to short fine leg
SRI LANKA:41.1 Machan to T Perera, no run, angling in on middle, defended to coverMatt Machan [2.0-0-17-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:40.6 Rob Taylor to T Perera, 1 run, full outside off, driven to long-off
SRI LANKA:40.5 Rob Taylor to Mathews, 1 run, yorker length on the stumps, dug out to mid-offThisara Perera, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:40.4 Rob Taylor to K Perera, out Caught by MacLeod!! Terrific running catch to his right at long-on. Perera's bat turned as he went for the big hit over long-on, that skewed all timing on the shot, the ball seemed to be falling in no-man's land, but MacLeod running across, took it and then tumbled to the turf. He gets up and has a smile on his face before being congratulated by his mates. K Perera c MacLeod b Rob Taylor 24(13) [4s-2 6s-2]Rob Taylor to K Perera, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:40.3 Rob Taylor to K Perera, no run, yorker length outside off, Perera digs it out and it's fielded by Taylor diving to his right, he appeals in hope, but clearly it bounced before being fielded by himThe umpires are checking for a possible C&B. But they are fine with it, as they reckon that it's a bump ball
SRI LANKA:40.2 Rob Taylor to K Perera, SIX, the bottom-hand comes into play as he flicks this over square leg, the fielder was running to his left and trying to catch, but the ball eluded his outstretched left-hand, Perera flicking ala Sanath with those strong wrists of his and gets six
SRI LANKA:40.1 Rob Taylor to Mathews, 1 run, driven wide of cover, where the fielder dives to his right and keeps it to a singleRob Taylor [7.0-0-23-0] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:39.6 Alasdair Evans to K Perera, wide, the slower ball, goes wrong, down leg
SRI LANKA:39.5 Alasdair Evans to K Perera, FOUR, just over the leaping cover. Full toss on off, Perera sliced the chip and got away, the fast outfield doing the rest. Evans is a very disappointed man
SRI LANKA:39.4 Alasdair Evans to K Perera, SIX, Perera is a fine striker of the cricket ball and he puts this back of a length delivery away over square leg, rocked back and muscled it flat. A spectator tries to catch it to his left, but fails to do so
SRI LANKA:39.3 Alasdair Evans to Mathews, 1 run, full and on the stumps, clipped uppishly to deep mid-wicket, fielded on the bounce
SRI LANKA:39.2 Alasdair Evans to K Perera, 1 run, back of a length on middle, clipped to deep backward square leg
SRI LANKA:39.1 Alasdair Evans to Mathews, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Mathews defends to point and takes a comfortable singleAlasdair Evans [7.0-0-50-1] is back into the attackThe batting powerplay has produced 57 runs for three wickets
SRI LANKA:38.6 Davey to K Perera, no run, Perera eyes another pull, but doesn't get any bat on the shot, dug in short and Davey ends the over with a dotAmidst all the hoopla and glitz surrounding Sanga's achievement, Davey is now the leading wicket-taker in this tournament. He has 14 wickets currently and has just eclipsed Boult to go top
SRI LANKA:38.5 Davey to Mathews, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Mathews drives to cover, and takes on the arm of Machan and beats the throw, makes it home

SRI LANKA:38.1 Davey to K Perera, FOUR, Perera latches on to a short and wide delivery outside off, cracks it over cover, the width was there and Perera didn't miss out
SRI LANKA:37.6 M A Leask to Mathews, SIX, make that 16 off the last three balls. Leask is tossing it up and Mathews won't let go. Gets forward and muscles it flat over deep mid-wicket, just too much power packed into that bottom-hand of Mathews
SRI LANKA:37.5 M A Leask to Mathews, FOUR, Mathews is in the mood to hit today. Shows off his skill by reverse sweeping over point. Saw the leg stump line and lifted it over the fielder. All too easy now
SRI LANKA:37.4 M A Leask to Mathews, SIX, well-caught in the crowd at deep backward square leg, by a senior citizen. Mathews just knelt down and nonchalantly swept a middle stump delivery over backward square leg, where it was held with both hands by a man in the stands
SRI LANKA:37.3 M A Leask to Mathews, no run, tucked off the back foot to short mid-wicketA slip in place now for Leask as he comes round the wicket
SRI LANKA:37.2 M A Leask to K Perera, 1 run, shortish outside off, cut down to sweeper cover
SRI LANKA:37.1 M A Leask to K Perera, no run, tossed up on the stumps, from round the wicket, Perera pushes it back to LeaskMichael Leask [6.0-0-46-0] is back into the attack

SRI LANKA:36.5 Davey to Sangakkara, out Caught by Matthew Cross!! Davey is on a hat-trick now. He has got the big wicket of Sangakkara. Well bowled actually by Davey, saw Sangakkara charging and bowled it full and wide outside off, Sangakkara had to reach out to drive and edged the shot behind, easy take for Cross. Sangakkara walks off, without even waiting for the umpire's decision. A few claps here and there from the sparse crowd. Sangakkara c Matthew Cross b Davey 124(95) [4s-13 6s-4]Davey to Sangakkara, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Angelo Mathews, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:36.4 Davey to M Jayawardene, out Caught by MacLeod!! Davey strikes again in the powerplay. Some respite for the Scots. It was a slower delivery from Davey, Jayawardene came down the track and was looking to go over mid-off, but completely mistimed it, the skier is easily held at mid-off. M Jayawardene c MacLeod b Davey 2(6)Davey to M Jayawardene, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:36.3 Davey to M Jayawardene, no run, back of a length outside off, dabbed straight to the fielder at point

SRI LANKA:36.1 Davey to Sangakkara, no run, Sangakkara completely mistimes the big cover drive, off the inside half back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:36.1 Davey to Sangakkara, wide, way outside off, wide called
SRI LANKA:35.6 Alasdair Evans to Sangakkara, 1 run, no he can't! Evans has a wry smile on his face after escaping the ignominy of suffering all boundaries in the over. Including the wide as well. Evans goes over the wicket and bowls a low full toss, Sangakkara was early into the paddle, and since it was well outside off, he couldn't get it past the short fine fielder, the fielder was moving backwards anticipating the shot, but it went to his right and he got there to field eventually. So Sangakkara misses out
SRI LANKA:35.5 Alasdair Evans to Sangakkara, FOUR, Sangakkara is waiting to play that stroke and gets one more boundary. Evans bowls that down leg and slower, Sangakkara just played the paddle, but lifted it over short fine inside the ring, the ball beats the chasing fielder. Already 23 off the over. One more ball to come, can Sangakkara do it?
SRI LANKA:35.5 Alasdair Evans to Sangakkara, wide, the pressure tells on Evans, who bowls this well down leg, even then Sangakkara wants to paddle that, but can't reach it
SRI LANKA:35.4 Alasdair Evans to Sangakkara, FOUR, again over the off-side field. Backs away and creates the room, waits for it and then smashes this over point, who was inside the ring, the ball runs away and it's all boundaries this over. Can Sangakkara emulate Dilshan? who did it the other day
SRI LANKA:35.3 Alasdair Evans to Sangakkara, FOUR, what does Sangakkara do now? Manipulates the field by shuffling across to off and takes the full toss, paddles it over short fine, inside the ring, another boundary. What will Evans do now?Now a deep point is placed
SRI LANKA:35.2 Alasdair Evans to Sangakkara, FOUR, all the fielders are in on the off-side and Sangakkara will go over there once more. Makes room and then goes down on a bent knee, to go uppishly over cover. A field change is required I feel
SRI LANKA:35.1 Alasdair Evans to Sangakkara, SIX, now Sangakkara will help himself. The slower cutting short delivery, Sangakkara skips out, makes room and then carves the bowler over point, the ball thuds into the advertising boards on the full. Evans just shrugs his shoulders and puffs his cheeks out, before walking back to his markAlasdair Evans [6.0-0-26-1] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:34.6 Davey to M Jayawardene, no run, back of a length on off, defended. End of a successful and good over from Davey
SRI LANKA:34.5 Davey to M Jayawardene, no run, Jayawardene pre-meditates the stroke and misses out. Skips out to the bowler and the bowler slips in the slower cutting short delivery, Jayawardene tries to adjust and then ramp it past the keeper, but the ball bounces over his bat
SRI LANKA:34.4 Davey to M Jayawardene, no run, back of a length outside off, defended to the off-side
SRI LANKA:34.3 Davey to M Jayawardene, 2 runs, Jayawardene is early into the drive and lobs it over cover, and wide of the fielder, is off the mark with that coupleMahela Jayawardene, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:34.2 Davey to Dilshan, out Caught by MacLeod!! Dilshan is gone, trying to clear mid-off. Davey did well to follow Dilshan as he charged down, slipped it in towards Dilshan who mishit the loft, MacLeod at mid-off, leapt and took it on the second attempt. Dilshan c MacLeod b Davey 104(99) [4s-10 6s-1]Davey to Dilshan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:34.1 Davey to Dilshan, FOUR, sliced away. Full and outside off, Dilshan threw the bat at that and got it in the gap, went hard and got it between short third and backward point, races awayThe batting powerplay is on now, as if the Scots didn't have anything else to worry about
SRI LANKA:34.1 Davey to Dilshan, wide, Davey slips one down leg, Dilshan was looking for the Dilscoop but it was well wide of himJosh Davey [5.0-0-48-0] is back into the attackDrinks are on the field now
SRI LANKA:33.6 Coetzer to Sangakkara, 2 runs, Sangaaaaaaaaaa! What.A.Playa! The first man ever in ODI history to make four tons in a row. Many have done it thrice. But no-one till today has got to that peak. What's more. He has done it in a World Cup. At the age of 37. In his last World Cup. Is there a better all-round player than this man in the world currently? Only AB de Villiers can lay claim to that title. Gets there with a steer to third man and takes a couple. Look at that celebration from him. No aggro, no brashness, no over-the-top shouting, no show of emotion. Just a calm face, removes the helmet and then raises the bat. Has a word with Dilshan. That's how to do it - if he wants to, he could bat on for the next three, four years - such is the form he is in at the moment. It was inevitable, the moment he came out to bat today against Scotland, that the record would be broken, without any disrespect shown to the Scots. Sanga is too good a player to miss out on such a golden chance to break a record that has stood there for a long time
SRI LANKA:33.5 Coetzer to Dilshan, 1 run, fourth WC hundred for Dilshan! 22nd overall for Dilshan. Gets there with a nudge to fine leg. A look at the heavens and then a raise of the bat. Sanath applauds
SRI LANKA:33.4 Coetzer to Sangakkara, 1 run, Mommsen from cover hits direct and gives away an extra run, off the ricochet. Sangakkara drove it on the bounce to him at cover and he saw Dilshan out of his crease, shied and hit, but Dilshan had got back. The ball runs away and they take a single
SRI LANKA:33.3 Coetzer to Dilshan, 1 run, back of a length outside off, cut square of the wicket
SRI LANKA:33.2 Coetzer to Sangakkara, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Sangakkara gets forward and drives well, straight to the fielder at sweeper cover though
SRI LANKA:33.1 Coetzer to Sangakkara, FOUR, that is poor, poor bowling. Short and down leg, nothing ball with no-one behind square, on the fence, Sangakkara just had to get it in the gap and he helped that offering on its way, beating backward square inside the ring
SRI LANKA:32.6 Rob Taylor to Dilshan, no run, Rob Taylor is doing well, on a length and on the stumps, defended to the right of the bowler
SRI LANKA:32.5 Rob Taylor to Sangakkara, 1 run, low full toss, driven straight to the fielder at long-off
SRI LANKA:32.4 Rob Taylor to Sangakkara, no run, back of a length on off, Sangakkara pushes towards point and wants a run, not there reckons Dilshan
SRI LANKA:32.3 Rob Taylor to Sangakkara, no run, Sangakkara was eyeing the big hit over mid-wicket, Rob Taylor cramped him for room, by bowling it very full and on the stumps, dragged to short mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:32.2 Rob Taylor to Dilshan, 1 run, back of a length outside off, punched to sweeper cover
SRI LANKA:32.1 Rob Taylor to Dilshan, no run, short of length outside off, cut straight to the fielder at point. May have been a change of pace as wellRob Taylor [6.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:31.6 Coetzer to Sangakkara, FOUR, Sangakkara is peppering the off-side field today. He has taken a particular liking to the cover region. Goes over there once more, the width was there and he freed his arms to play an airy cover drive, sweeper had no chance. Moves into the nineties
SRI LANKA:31.5 Coetzer to Sangakkara, no run, pushes it straight to the fielder at point and looks for a single, Dilshan sends Sangakkara back
SRI LANKA:31.4 Coetzer to Sangakkara, no run, driven sweetly, but cover dives to his left and stops a certain boundary
SRI LANKA:31.3 Coetzer to Dilshan, 1 run, back of a length outside off, punched to sweeper cover
SRI LANKA:31.2 Coetzer to Dilshan, no run, Dilshan went too hard at the cover drive, another inside edge, rolls to short mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:31.1 Coetzer to Dilshan, 2 runs, so nearly dragged on. Dilshan is late on the attempted dab to the off-side, the ball comes on slowly and takes the inside edge, wide of the leg stump and they take a coupleKyle Coetzer [2.0-0-10-0] is back into the attack
SRI LANKA:30.6 Machan to Sangakkara, FOUR, did that carry to MacLeod at mid-wicket? Sangakkara's eyes lit up as he saw the high full toss outside off, swung across the line and didn't hit it as well as he would've liked. The bat turned as he hit it, MacLeod at mid-wicket dived full length to his left and just about got a hand on it, couldn't grasp it and shows off his disappointment, the ball runs away to the fence, beating deep mid-wicket. That has to go down as a drop chance. How much will Scotland pay for that miss?
SRI LANKA:30.6 Machan to Sangakkara, wide, Machan slips down leg, wide called
SRI LANKA:30.5 Machan to Sangakkara, no run, pushed off the front foot to cover
SRI LANKA:30.4 Machan to Sangakkara, SIX, so easy for Sangakkara. He sees the tossed up delivery outside off, kneels down and then slog-sweeps way over deep mid-wicket. There are no mishits or mistimes from Sangakkara when he is playing like this. He serenely moves onto 84 now
SRI LANKA:30.3 Machan to Dilshan, 1 run, Dilshan gently works another single through mid-wicket
SRI LANKA:30.2 Machan to Sangakkara, 1 run, Sangakkara's weight is back as he lofts over cover's leap, single to sweeper cover

Win the toss, bat first and you can make hay on a pitch that looks good for batting," reckons Rameez RajaTeams:Scotland (Playing XI): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Matt Machan, Freddie Coleman, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Rob Taylor, Michael Leask, Alasdair EvansSri Lanka (Playing XI): Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Kushal Janith Perera, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Dushmantha Chameera, Lasith MalingaSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batMommsen: "We would have batted. Looks a good one-day wicket. At the same time, I think it's quite hard a ground to defend on. So, nothing wrong in batting second. We have got three changes, Michael Leask comes in for Majid Haq, off-spinning option, Freddie Coleman and Rob Taylor come in as well. It has been an awesome experience, the first four games for us. We have played some good cricket and unfortunately we haven't been able to get that win. Nonetheless, though it is relatively new for us playing on this world stage and the boys are savouring every moment of it. I think definitely the atmosphere and pressure is amplified when you are playing at a World Cup, so I think each game we have become more relaxed and we have played better cricket as a result."Mathews: "We will have a bat first. Of course it looks really nice and hard. So, we will put the runs on the board, nice conditions to bat first so we will get runs on the board first. It was a good game. I thought 340 would have been a chasable score, but unfortunately 370 was a bit too much, but hopefully we can go well today. Not really, we have been playing pretty good cricket in the past four games and we will look to continue to do that in today's game as well. Kusal (Perera) takes his (Chandimal) place and also we got two more changes. Sachitra (Senanayake) and Upul Tharanga goes out, we have got Nuwan Kulasekara, Chameera Dushmantha and Kusal Janith in. Of course he (Kulasekara) is one of the players we can bank on. So, we look to play him and hope he goes well. He (Sangakkara) is an unbelievable player, isn't he? I mean he has scored three hundreds in a row and hopefully he can get another one today."Head-to-Head: Scotland have only played once against Sri Lanka and naturally it was the Asian team that came out on top. After setting a target of 285, Malinga blew away the Scottish batting line-up with a 5-wicket haul. Will the team winning the toss bat first or will they put the opposition in? We'll find out soon as the toss is on the way. Stay tuned!Weather Check: It is a cool day in Hobart. There is a bit of cloud around. The maximum temperature is 23 degress. Even though it's cloudy, there are no chances of rain. Perfect weather to play a game of cricket.ScotlandScotland have had their moments in this tournament. Almost running New Zealand close while defending a paltry 142, losing a thriller against Afghanistan and their best game was the previous one versus Bangladesh. Kyle Coetzer played a magnificent innings to set up a massive 319. But, the bowlers could not contain the Bangladeshi batsmen as Tamim, Mahmudullah, Rahim and Shakib went onto get fifties and helped Bangladesh pull off the second highest successful run-chase in World Cup.They have lost their games by not winning the key moments. In fact, the Scots are still searching for their first World Cup victory. They have the players who have been performing on an individual level, but the team hasn failed to stitch it together as a unit. The bowling looks settled with Wardlaw, Davey, Evans and Haq. The likes of Coetzer, Machan and Berrington have all scored fifties. But, still they have not contributed in unison. Can they win a game in this World Cup and leave a mark?Sri LankaSri Lanka didn't start off on the best of notes. They lost to New Zealand by a big margin and were put under tremendous pressure by Afghanistan. But, since then they have been in terrific form. They beat Bangladesh comprehensively, thanks to hundreds from Dilshan and Sangakkara. Once again riding on the back of a Sanga ton, they thrashed England and chased down 310. However, their previous game against Australia didn't pan out the way they wanted. Chasing 375, they were on course with a third ton from Sanga and some fireworks from Chandimal, before the latter had to retire hurt due to a hamstring injury. That tilted the match in Australia's favour and eventually, Australia won by 64 runs.That defeat should be forgotten quickly as they give Australia a run for their money. They can take heart from the fact that they became the first team to score 300 versus Australia in a World cup game. Nonetheless, Sri Lanka are a side that is suffering from a lot of injury woes. Dinesh Chandimal is the latest addition to their injury list, which already included, Dhammika Prasad, Jeevan Mendis, Dimuth Karunaratne. Kusal Perera has been drafted in as a replacement for Chandimal. With so many players injured, Sri Lanka are yet to decide upon their final XI. So, this game will given them an opportunity to test their best combination before the quarter-finals.13:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: On Monday, Bangladesh created history at the Adelaide Oval. By beating England, they ensured their qualification for the knockouts for the first time. That win also took Sri Lanka through to the quarterfinals. The Islanders currently have 6 points in 5 games and today they will be up against a spirited Scottish team. Let us just have a recap as to what these two teams have been doing lately.Preview:After the final over thriller on Saturday between Ireland and Zimbabwe, the Bellerive Oval in Hobart will play host to Sri Lanka's final group stage game. Having already been assured of a place in the quarter-finals following Bangladesh's historic win, an injury-hit Sri Lanka take on Scotland looking to finalize their combination ahead of the crucial knockout phase. Scotland, despite putting in spirited performances, find themselves without a win in four games, with Sri Lanka and Australia to play. The game also assumes importance to determine Sri Lanka's potential quarter-final opponent. A Sri Lanka win will take them above Bangladesh, who are yet to play New Zealand, and potentially avoid a clash with the table-toppers from Pool B (India).Team News:Sri LankaSri Lanka's injury woes were exacerbated when Dinesh Chandimal hobbled out of the Australia game and the World Cup with a hamstring injury. A significant blow considering he had just scored a 22-ball half-century. Since the start of the warmup games, Sri Lanka have lost Dhammika Prasad, Jeevan Mendis, Dimuth Karunaratne and now Chandimal. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, who suffered an injury to his finger during the England game has not sufficiently recovered and is unlikely to recover before the quarters. Kusal Perera has been drafted into the squad while Kithruwan Vithanage has been flown in as cover. Amidst all the injury trouble, a 37-year old Kumar Sangakkara became the first man to score three consecutive World Cup centuries when he scored the 104 at the SCG. Dilshan, Jayawardene, Thirimanne have all scored hundreds but the bowling, especially in the middle overs, remains an area of concern. The trio of Angelo Mathews, Thissara Perera and Seekkuge Prasanna gave away 223 runs in their 26 overs against Australia. The think-tank would consider bringing back Suranga Lakmal to reinforce the bowling department.Probable XI:Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara (wk), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews (c), Upul Tharanga, Thissara Perera, Kusal Perera/Nuwan Kulasekara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Sachithra Senanayake, Lasith MalingaPlayer to watch out for: Angelo Mathews - The captain had been the star of Sri Lanka coming in to the World Cup. However, with the Sangakkara-led top-order firing on all cylinders, Mathews hasn't had enough time with the bat. Even with the ball, he endured a forgettable game against the Aussies. Look forward to an improved showing from the versatile Sri Lankan captain.ScotlandScotland travel to Tasmania without a win in any of the four games in their New Zealand sojourn. They haven't been completely woeful either. They succeeded in sending jitters down the red-hot New Zealand side despite defending a small score. Against Afghanistan, they came up against an inspired Samiullah Shenwari, who took the game away from them. The biggest worry for Scotland has been that they haven't succeeded in putting a solid all-round performance, a fact highlighted in their previous game against Bangladesh. Kyle Coetzer's 158 (record for associate nations in World Cups) received no backing from the bowling and Bangladesh chased down 318 at a canter. Matt Machan, Richie Berrington have been good with the bat, without being great. Preston Mommsen will hope for one of the middle-order batsmen to carry on and make it big. Lead bowler Iain Wardlaw has been disappointing in the tournament and will hope for an improved showing. Wardlaw, Josh Davey and Co. now face the daunting prospect of bowling at a marauding Sri Lankan top-order. At the least, they will be expected to put in another spirited show as their World Cup winds down.Probable XI:Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Hamish Gardiner, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen (c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross (wk), Josh Davey, Majid Haq, Alasdair Evans, Iain WardlawPlayer to watch out for: Preston Mommsen - The Scottish captain hasn't found the going easy with the bat. His 39 against Bangladesh took his World Cup tally to a meagre 88 runs. He will look to prove a point in the team's two remaining clashes.Pitch and Conditions:The Bellerive Oval hosted the Ireland-Zimbabwe thriller in which 657 runs were scored. Despite being a tad two-paced, the short square boundaries prove to be a handful to defend. Sri Lankan batsmen should enjoy themselves on the Hobart pitch. The forecast indicate a 20% chance of rain but the showers are unlikely to force a washout.Stats and Trivia:- Kumar Sangakkara is the first man to score three successive World Cup centuries.- Kyle Coetzer needs 29 runs to become the third Scotland player to score 1000 ODI runs. Gavin Hamilton and Neil McCallum are the others.Quotes:"We've been in a couple of winning positions, and just maybe through lack of experience on playing at this stage, we've not been able to win those games"- Scotland captain Preston Mommsen cited inexperience for his team's failure to close out games."There are big game players and he's (Lasith Malinga) one of those. He stands up and he has a big game and in pressure situations, he comes up trumps"- Sri Lankan coach Marvan Atapattu was happy with the progress made by his strike bowler post his injury.LATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
