IRELAND:49.1 49.1Anderson to Mooney, FOUR!!, Dear o dear! The Irish have done it, the biggest WC chase ever and who has done it? Yes folks, it's not a dream, Ireland have outplayed England with their batting skills, it was a fuller one, Mooney works it to the on side, calls two straight away, but he struck that pretty well, wide of the man at deep mid wicket, a boundary, Ireland win by 3 wickets!This is heading the Irish way, 3 off 6 balls is too easy!
IRELAND:48.6  Broad to Mooney, 1 run, Monkish is Mooney, keeps his nerve, backs away and it is heading towards middle stump, Mooney just calmly sliced it to deep backward point, he keeps the strike
IRELAND:48.5  Broad to Johnston, 1 run, on the pads, Johnston tucks that one to fine leg
IRELAND:48.4  Broad to Johnston, 2 runs, that's ridiculous fielding from the English fielders! Johnston gets it wide of the fielder at short mid wicket, Bell was running after it, long on and long off were running towards the ball, total misunderstanding and they take two
IRELAND:48.3  Broad to Johnston, no run, back of a length and angled in, Johnston looks to cut but it was too close to the body, misses it, Prior gives no chance for them to sneak a bye!
IRELAND:48.2  Broad to Johnston, FOUR!!, that's a poor ball Mr. Broad, a low full toss outside the off stump, Mooney drives hard through extra cover, Luke Wright runs to his right and dives full length, fails to pull the ball back, four more!Trent Johnston, right handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:48.1  Broad to Kevin O'Brien, out Kevin O'Brien Run Out!!1 run completed, The yorker produces a wicket, not a bowled or a LBW, but a run-out. Kevin O'Brien drilled it to the on side and set off for a single, the fielder was late to get towards the ball, and the batsmen thought of taking the second, Bresnan was the man, he hurls in a sharp throw to Prior, Kevin O'Brien dives full length but fails to make ground, he is caught inches short, easy decision for the third umpire. Kevin O'Brien run out (Bresnan/Prior) 113(63) [4s-13 6s-6] Broad to Kevin O'Brien, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!That looks close, Kevin O'Brien looks OUT! Is that an end to a mammoth innings?Stuart Broad [8.0-0-64-0] is back into the attackStrauss is having a conference with Broad, 12 off 12! Can Ireland do it? Yes they can, say the Bengaluru crowd!
IRELAND:47.6  Anderson to Mooney, FOUR!!, the World Cup 2011 has produced some blinders and this is one! Ireland inching closer to an upset, it was a short ball, Mooney pulled it with venom, full blooded thwack and the ball goes into the deep mid wicket fence, just fell short of the ropes or else it would have been a biggie!
IRELAND:47.5  Anderson to Kevin O'Brien, 1 run, Kevin O'Brien drives a pitched up delivery to long on for one, singles will do for Ireland
IRELAND:47.4  Anderson to Mooney, 1 run, If you have been following this game until now, you would know that the edges are falling in no man's land! Another one of those, Mooney's bottom hand came off as he went after it, the ball lobs up in the air and falls behind short mid wicket
IRELAND:47.3  Anderson to Mooney, no run, Mooney looks to whip that one across, middle and leg line, well bowled by Anderson, rolls off Mooney's pad to the on side but this time he can't take the single
IRELAND:47.2  Anderson to Kevin O'Brien, 1 run, Nope, he cant! Kevin O'Brien drives a fuller ball in the air, a couple of bounces down to long offWhat is running on in Anderson's mind? Will he turn it around?
IRELAND:47.1  Anderson to Mooney, leg byes, 1 run, on the pads, Mooney looks to tuck it to the on side, goes behind square on the on side off his pads, another singleJames Anderson [7.0-1-38-1] is back into the attack
IRELAND:46.6  Bresnan to Kevin O'Brien, 2 runs, Oh dear! Comedy of errors from the English camp, Kevin O'Brien digged a yorker just in front of the wicket and set off, Bresnan comes and tries to find Mooney short by kicking the ball onto the stumps, gets his football skills totally wrong, he will certainly not be playing for Leeds United if he's thinking of playing football in the near future, the batsmen sneak in an extra run
IRELAND:46.5  Bresnan to Mooney, 1 run, short again from Bresnan, Mooney swivels and pulls, but the ball falls short of the man running in from deep backward square leg, he has to be happy with the single
IRELAND:46.4  Bresnan to Mooney, no run, good bouncer that! But was close to being called a wide, Mooney misses the upper push and Bresnan gets away with that
IRELAND:46.3  Bresnan to Mooney, FOUR!!, Mooney decides to go after Bresnan's short ball, backs away and cuts it over cover, one bounce over the ropes, 23 from 21, which way is it heading? Another tie in the offing?
IRELAND:46.2  Bresnan to Mooney, no run, a dot ball and that would cheer the very few English supporters at Bengaluru, it was punched straight to point
IRELAND:46.1  Bresnan to Mooney, no run, another one pushed across the left hander, he misses as he looks to drive one punchily through cover
IRELAND:45.6  Broad to Mooney, 1 run, Broad is holding his knee as he delivers that ball, Mooney pushes it down to long off, single taken, is Broad injured? There are already two substitutes on the field for the English and it is needless to say that things are not going good for them
IRELAND:45.5  Broad to Mooney, FOUR!!, Take that says Mooney and bludgeons a half volley through extra cover, what a shot! Trust me, that went to the boundary at the rate of knots, Ireland reach 300, that in itself is an achievement
IRELAND:45.4  Broad to Mooney, no run, too full, it was angled in, Mooney digs it out to the off side, may have got a leading edge as well, he was looking to play that across
IRELAND:45.3  Broad to Kevin O'Brien, 1 run, not much bounce on that one, a slower short delivery pulled away to deep square leg, 'almost a slow motion shot' says David Lloyd on air
IRELAND:45.2  Broad to Mooney, 1 run, punched to cover by Mooney, single taken, they should be happy with that
IRELAND:45.1  Broad to Kevin O'Brien, 1 run, slower delivery that, fuller as well, Kevin O'Brien drills it down the wicket towards mid off, single taken, these games in Bangalore have been the most interesting of the lot
IRELAND:44.6  Bresnan to Mooney, FOUR!!, back of a length, Mooney gets a thickish outside edge, that would do! Broad dives near the third man boundary but the ball races away beating him, 35 from 30 needed now!
IRELAND:44.5  Bresnan to Mooney, no run, it was angled across Mooney, he looks to steer it across, a play and a miss
IRELAND:44.4  Bresnan to Mooney, no run, banged in short, it hurried onto Mooney as he looked to pull, goes off the helmet to Prior who takes a beauty, he certainly saved four runs by diving to his left, the English appeal for caught behind, but it went off the grill
IRELAND:44.3  Bresnan to Mooney, no run, short of a good length, Mooney goes back, whips it to the on side, short mid wicket does not allow a single
IRELAND:44.2  Bresnan to Mooney, no run, back of a length, pushed across from over the wicket, Mooney punches it to cover point, the fielder is standing a couple of paces forward than the normal position
IRELAND:44.1  Bresnan to Kevin O'Brien, leg byes, 1 run, Kevin O'Brien looks to tuck this one fine, goes off his thigh guard, the umpire signals a leg bye
IRELAND:43.6  Broad to Mooney, FOUR!!, that would do a world of good for the Irish, and the crowd go wild! The outside edge runs wide of the keeper and rolls away to the third man boundary, Broad is bowling well, getting his variations right but the luck is just not with the English today
IRELAND:43.5  Broad to Kevin O'Brien, 1 run, the leg cutter from Broad, Kevin O'Brien taps it to the off side to the right of the keeper and takes a single
IRELAND:43.4  Broad to Kevin O'Brien, 2 runs, the fielding has been really poor and it stays that way! It was a short ball, Broad took the pace off it, Kevin O'Brien pulled it to deep mid wicket, the batsmen take on Tredwell's arm and complete the second run, Broad is not happy with that effort from the deep
IRELAND:43.3  Broad to Mooney, 1 run, shortish, width on offer, Mooney opens the face of the bat and punches it behind square on the off side, gets the danger man on strike

IRELAND:42.5 Bresnan to Mooney, 2 runs, Drama! short of length but on the middle and leg, Mooney gets on top of it, taps it towards cover and zips across, the fielder - Bell - comes running in from cover, has an under arm shy at the stumps, would have been close had he hit that, Prior was not backing up and they take another run off the overthrow
IRELAND:42.4  Bresnan to Kevin O'Brien, 1 run, that's sensible cricket from Kevin O'Brien, just works a length delivery behind square on the on side
IRELAND:42.3  Bresnan to Mooney, leg byes, 1 run, back of a length and on the body, Mooney looks to go for the short arm pull, does not make contact, the ball rolls to the on side and they sneak in a single

IRELAND:41.3  Broad to Kevin O'Brien, out Cusack Run Out!! Finally, England manage a break-through. Kevin O'Brien played it with a slant bat, pushed it to backward point, slight misunderstanding between the two, Cusack was a long way down, Kevin O'Brien was still a couple of paces in front of the batting crease, Cusack senses that Kevin O'Brien was never going to make it, decides to turn back and try his best to escape the run out, unfortunately, he can't beat Collingwood's throw, Broad does the rest, Cusack could not make it despite the dive! A sad end to a fighting innings. Cusack run out (Collingwood/Broad) 47(58) [4s-3 6s-1] Broad to Kevin O'Brien, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Third umpire has been called for a run out chance, Cusack looks to be out!

IRELAND:11.4  Bresnan to Joyce, no run, Mark Nicholas on air was saying just before this ball that Matt Prior was telling him that Bresnan hits the gloves the hardest. And this ball proves that, hurried onto Joyce and cramped him for room, forced to play the pull, the ball looped over Bresnan and Anderson running in from short cover, lunged forward to take it with one hand, it hit his hand and went to ground, catch dropped!!

Stirling c Pietersen b Bresnan 32(28) [4s-5 6s-1] Bresnan to Stirling, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
IRELAND:9.4  Bresnan to Stirling, FOUR!!, delicate and he shows his skill by gently nurdling the ball outside leg, wide and to the right of short fine leg, bounced in front of him and went away, Stirling has played that late and got it in the gap

IRELAND:6.2  Anderson to Joyce, no run, in the corridor of uncertainty, angled across, Joyce shoulders arms watchfully
IRELAND:6.1  Anderson to Joyce, FOUR!!, What can one say about the timing on that one? back of a length delivery on off stump, Joyce went deep back into his crease and would have thought, he would get a single for his efforts, a soft tap with an open face, but the ball has a mind of it's own, beats backward point and as if it's on steroids, scoots away giving third man not a chance in hell
IRELAND:5.6  Broad to Stirling, no run, back to basics, full and targetting off stump, Stirling gets the bat down in time and squeezes it down to mid off
IRELAND:5.5  Broad to Stirling, FOUR!!, another of Ravi Shaz's cliches on air: 'Stirling has got a good eye', Stirling though picked the slower one, the one bowled from the back of the hand by Broad and Stirling swatted it high and over mid on, almost went all the way, one bounce over the ropes

IRELAND:5.1  Broad to Stirling, no run, yorker length delivery on the stumps and Stirling digs it out back to Broad, dug it onto his boot and the ball looped to Broad
IRELAND:4.6  Anderson to Joyce, no run, ripper, and as expected Anderson has a stare at Joyce, he did not like the previous ball going for four and produces a superb delivery that cuts Joyce in half and flies over the stumps, it sneaked through Joyce's forward defence and missed the off stump too
IRELAND:4.5  Anderson to Joyce, FOUR!!, Anderson won't like that shot one bit, because Joyce is now playing for Ireland, wonderfully played, got forward and drove it wide of Strauss at short cover, was in the air, but no one had a chance to catch or stop it

IRELAND:3.1  Broad to Stirling, FOUR!!, although it went off the inner half or the thickish inside edge, the bats these days are so good that it will go the fence, once it crosses the infield that is, full and Stirling's attempted heave went down to deep mid wicket, the fielder gave chase, but gave up in the end

IRELAND:1.6  Broad to Stirling, no run, back to full and on the stumps, Stirling defends from the crease, half forward and pushed to silly mid on
IRELAND:1.5  Broad to Stirling, SIX!!, these boundaries are ridiculously short, but that does not take away from the fact that it has been a good shot, in fact a superb shot, swiveled across and then pulled it just over the ropes at fine leg, KP was a little too square and had no chance, Stirling gets off the mark in a tremendous fashion
IRELAND:1.4  Broad to Stirling, no run, full and targetting off and middle, Stirling pushes it to mid off
IRELAND:1.3  Broad to Joyce, 1 run, punched off the backfoot to a rising delivery outside off, rolls down to third man
IRELAND:1.2  Broad to Joyce, no run, pitched outside leg and Joyce was caught on the crease, he shuffled across a tad and it hit him on the pad, once it pitches outside leg, not-out is the call according to the laws of the game and there is no changing the decisionEngland have gone for the review. Original decision was not-out and Broad persuaded Strauss to take the review. The original decision stays. Bumble on air: Broad goes for the review both when he is batting and when he is bowling, that's the theory back home in the UK.
IRELAND:1.2  Broad to Joyce, wide, short delivery and down leg, wide called
IRELAND:1.1  Broad to Joyce, no run, full ball outside off, in the 140 ks region, Joyce gets forward and pushes it to the off sideStuart Broad, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackThe big Iron lever is out and it is doing it's job - hammering out hard near the bowler's landing area. Ravi Shastri informs us that Broad missed the last game because he ate some Sushi and got ill. Anyway here we go as he comes in to bowl.
IRELAND:0.6  Anderson to Stirling, no run, fine delivery, straightened after landing on a good length on off stump, Stirling was hesitant and lamely pushed forward to defend, was unsure whether to go back or come forward, played inside the line and the ball missed the edge and was close to the off stump as well, superb opening over from Anderson

IRELAND:0.1  Anderson to Porterfield, out Bowled!! Just as I said that Anderson needed some wickets to boost his low confidence, he has gotten one off the first ball of the innings. Regulation outswinger, angled across on a fuller length outside off, Porterfield's eyes lit up and tried to lace it through the covers, played it with an angled bat and the resultant inside edge, hit the ground and then trickled back to hit the stumps. Anderson sports a smile, a loosener gets a wicket. Golden duck for the Irish captain. Porterfield b Anderson 0(1) Anderson to Porterfield, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Porterfield and Stirling are at the crease. Porterfield is on strike. Anderson will open the attackThe lights are on at the Chinnaswamy stadium and people are slowly trickling into the stadium. Lots of free seats and a WC game is a WC game, despite India not playing. Anderson may get some swing under lights, he looks to be a little low on confidence in the ODI format and needs a few wickets to perk up his ego. The Irish before the game had said that they will come at England hard and will not take a backward step. Whether that happens, when chasing a massive total remains to be seen. Porterfield surveys the field and is facing.England have coasted to a massive total despite the late collapse and the top order looks more solid than ever. KP showed that he has fitted into the role of an opener quite comfortably as he biffed his way to a half century before throwing it away. The run machine Trott and the elegant Bell continued effortlessly on a pitch that offered excellent value for their shots and powered England to a second successive score in excess of 300. It will be highly wishful thinking to expect the Irish to match England's effort against India on the same ground a few days ago. Nevertheless they would be giving it their all and England, bolstered by the return of Broad, will look to be as clinical with the ball as they were with the bat. Join us shortly for the run chase.4
ENGLAND:49.6  Mooney to Bresnan, out Caught by Johnston and Mooney gets his 4th wicket!! Bresnan goes across, swings hard, a top edge and the ball skies up in the air, Johnston comes running in from deep mid wicket, judges it carefully, takes it with fingers pointing up and pouches it close to his chest, 327 is what the English get, it would certainly get some hitting if Ireland have to fancy themselves to chase this one. Bresnan c Johnston b Mooney 4(8) Mooney to Bresnan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ENGLAND:42.6  Mooney to Bell, out Caught by Stirling!! Fabulous catch that at mid wicket! Bell can't believe it, he chipped that using his wrists looking to find the gap through mid wicket, but Stirling flew to his left and dived with both hands stretched forward, did well to get his fingers underneath, the bowler is delighted, but that's been a fine innings nevertheless.

Right, we are all set to go and this is Srivathsa, who will be bringing it to you till the first drinks break.A magnificent blue sky today in Bangalore. Lots of English and Irish supporters are in the stadium as both the sides walk out for the national anthems. The Irish national anthem is first up and then the English one. Today is Strauss' 34th birthday, so wish him a very happy birthday from all of us here. So far in this tournament the minnows have been routed, will today be any different? Can the Irish repeat their heroics from 2007 when they sent Pakistan packing? Or will England continue their fine run that started during the Ashes? though it must be said they were thrashed 1-6 by the Aussies in the ODIs after the Ashes.Teams:Ireland (Playing XI): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien(w), Alex Cusack, Kevin O'Brien, Gary Wilson, John Mooney, Trent Johnston, George Dockrell, Boyd RankinEngland (Playing XI): Andrew Strauss(c), Kevin Pietersen, Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Matt Prior(w), Michael Yardy, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James AndersonEngland have won the toss and elected to batPorterfield: It is a pretty good wicket, there will be a lot of runs and we would like to chase it down. We want to restrict them to a decent total. We have played well in the warm up games and we need to take some positives from that.Strauss: Looks like a good wicket, we would like to bat and score runs. We were happy with our batting performance, we need to replicate the performance today. The India England game ignited the WC, we need to make sure it's not a temporary high. Ireland are a strong side, we won't take them lightly. Broad has recovered well and he will play.Pitch Report: This is the same pitch that was used in the India versus England game. It has a little bit more grass and it looks better. There are some dry patches and it will be a great wicket for the batsmen.Hello and Welcome to the coverage of the game between England and Ireland at Bangalore. After the thrilling tie three days ago, England will be looking to put on a more confident display against the Irish, but they will know that Ireland cannot be taken lightly. Ireland, on the other hand, will be looking to put on a better display after their disappointing show against Bangladesh. I am Sid V, and I will be bringing you all the action with Ajith, Srivathsa and Pradeep. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Saurabh SomaniSo far in the World Cup, the ICC's stance on minnows not being a part of it from 2015 has proved ably justified. Every team that is sub-standard, has been treated as such. However, it is also a fact that since 1996, each World Cup has seen at least one minnow upset an established Test nation.
If there is anything in that, it would suggest that in this World Cup too, an upset is waiting to happen. In the first match in Bangalore after the epic tied one, England will want to ensure that the upset that is due, happens another day.Team News:England: England will be going into the match high on confidence. Not only did they chase an imposing total under the lights in the second innings, but they did it against a side that had 40,000 people cheering their every move. They will also be boosted by the return of Stuart Broad, who missed the match against India. Broad's entry will almost certainly mean that Ajmal Shahzad - who struck the six that enabled the tie - will sit out of the final eleven. England's batting was shown to be world class, and with Andrew Strauss in exceptional form, the Pietersen-Strauss combo at the top of the order will be difficult to contain. England's only real worry is their bowling, and more specifically the bowling of spearhead James Anderson. Anderson has gone for plenty of runs in both ODIs England have played so far, and while it hasn't cost them a match yet, it nearly did against India, and surely will in the future if he doesn't get his act together. If England sort out their bowling woes, they will go from being amongst the good sides in the World Cup to being a formidable one.Ireland: Ireland gave Bangladesh the fright of their lives, but ultimately could not keep up and ended up losing their first tie. They will have seen how the Indian batsmen and the Netherlands batsmen handled the English bowlers and are sure to take tips from that. Ireland will go in with one major psychological advantage over England: They have nothing to lose, and England have everything to lose if the result of the match is not a big victory for England. By having no pressure, Ireland can play more freely.Head to Head:The two teams have gone head to head in 3 ODIs till now, with England winning all three. One of the matches was at the 2007 World Cup, which England won by 48 runs.Quotes:"Nothing dramatic has to change, we played well in the warm-up games -- we've just got to be a bit more ruthless with the bat." - Ireland captain William Porterfield.
"We haven't played our best cricket yet and we have just tied with India, chasing 338. That has got to be a good sign." - England batsman Ian Bell.Teams:England (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Kevin Pietersen, Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, Ravi Bopara, Matt Prior(w), Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Stuart Broad, James Anderson, Ajmal Shahzad, James Tredwell, Luke Wright, Michael YardyIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien(w), Andrew White, Kevin O'Brien, Andre Botha, John Mooney, Trent Johnston, George Dockrell, Boyd Rankin, Alex Cusack, Nigel Jones, Albert van der Merwe, Gary WilsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
