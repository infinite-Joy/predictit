It was a please hit-me ball, short and ample width on offer, Amla rises on his toes to cut, only manages a thick top-edge to the keeper. Maybe he was tired and hence couldn't middle the stroke. Jordan got some extra bounce too and that perhaps might have forced the edge. Amla walks off to a standing applause from the dressing room.

That is a high class stroke and Mark Boucher on air sums it up aptly - when he says that, "almost like a left-handed Sachin Tendulkar." High elbow and all that. Held the pose for the cameramen too

SOUTH AFRICA:4.3 Willey to Amla, FOUR, that is hit with force yet Amla looked so silky. Willey went a bit too full and Amla got forward to wrist that wide of a diving mid-off. The wrists took over and that enabled the ball to speed off the turf. Moeen Ali's dive was a despairing one

SOUTH AFRICA:1.4 Topley to Amla, FOUR, he failed to hit the gap last ball, but this time opens the face of the bat on the square drive and gets it through cover-point. Point had no chance. When he is in form, those drives flow from Amla's bat

SOUTH AFRICA:0.1 Willey to de Kock, no run, swing for Willey first up, outside off, de Kock has a sighter, left alonede Kock and Amla are at the crease. de Kock is on strike. Willey will open the attackWelcome back for the chase.. Willey has the new ball. de Kock will face offWhew! So England finish with 318/8 - A total that didn't look possible at the half-way stage. Credit should go to Root, Hales and Stokes who dug deep and helped England post a mammoth total. You might argue 318 isn't a mammoth total considering the recent ODI trend. But 300-plus has never been chased at this venue and South Africa should chase the improbable to stay alive in the series. There's some uneven bounce and batting under lights might be a bit easier. Let's see who will play the role of Root and Stokes for South Africa. Be back in about 30 minutes...4

ENGLAND:40.2 Rabada to Stokes, leg byes, 1 run, good length delivery that pitched outside leg, Stokes was late on the flick, missed and is rapped in front of middle and leg.

Looks like so and yep! It pitched outside leg and the review goes in vain...

ENGLAND:39.4 Tahir to Root, no run, flicked to mid-wicket
ENGLAND:39.3 Tahir to Root, FOUR, that's the shot of the day for me. He stoops down on one knee and goes for an inside out loft over extra cover, just bounced in front of the ropes, that shot deserved a six!

ENGLAND:37.3 Tahir to Stokes, no run, blocked from the crease
ENGLAND:37.2 Tahir to Root, 1 run, ever wondered why cricket experts rate Joe Root as one of the finest batsmen of this era? This is one of those many reasons. When the going gets tough, the tough get going - Root just proved that saying right. He reaches his landmark with a punch down to long-on, gets to the other end and takes his helmet off to acknowledge the applause. Well played Joe!

ENGLAND:35.6 Tahir to Root, 1 run, works this through mid-wicket and Root will keep strike
ENGLAND:35.5 Tahir to Root, SIX, "Imran Tahir continues to struggle" as Mic. Holding points out on air. He bowled a flurry of full tosses last match and now again! Dishes out a hip-high full toss which Root smokes it with utter disdain over the cow corner fence

ENGLAND:33.6 Wiese to Eoin Morgan, out Caught by Amla!! A leaping take by Amla at mid-wicket and Morgan's troubles in the middle comes to an end. This was full and around off, Morgan was going hard at it - Probably trying to hit it straight, (mistimed off the toe-end) the bat handle turns on impact and ends up offering an easy catch to Amla.

ENGLAND:32.1 Kyle Abbott to Root, 1 run, hip-tickler from Abbott, on a length and Root clips it behind square on the leg-sideThat will be drinks. South Africa did well to pull things back by dismissing Hales and Buttler in quick succession. Morgan looked scratchy in his brief stay while Root has looked fluent. The ball isn't coming on nicely but England will fancy their chances in the final overs. A target closer to 300 will be a good one. Just a reminder: 300 has never been chased at this venue

ENGLAND:26.5 Rabada to Buttler, out Caught by Duminy!! Whew! A surprise. Jos Buttler who looked impeccable in the series so far is gone for a first-ball duck. Seemed like a trap from the Proteas. This full delivery was speared into Buttler's pads and he wanted to flick it fine. Placed it in the air (only for a fleeting moment) and backward short leg takes a tumbling catch to his right. Buttler c Duminy b Rabada 0(1)Rabada to Buttler, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!

ENGLAND:24.3 Rabada to Root, FOUR, another inside edge and another boundary for Root, he charges down to slog this length delivery wide of mid-on. Could only get some edge on that and Rabada's pace took care of the rest. Amla tried to make a sliding stop at fine leg but to no avail

ENGLAND:24.1 Rabada to Hales, 1 run, glided down to third man
ENGLAND:23.6 Wiese to Hales, 1 run, leading edge and safe! Good length delivery angled in late just outside off, Hales was a tad too early on the stroke, he was trying to flick it over mid-wicket. A thick edge and it dies down well in front of an incoming point
ENGLAND:23.5 Wiese to Hales, no run, stifled appeal for lbw but that would have probably missed leg. Short of a length delivery nipped back in to catch Hales on the shuffle, he was trying to flick, couldn't lay bat on ball. It hit him high and going by the seam, it could have missed leg

ENGLAND:21.6 Wiese to Root, no run, pushed off the front foot to cover
ENGLAND:21.5 Wiese to Root, FOUR, Wiese has his hands on his head. That was a nothing shot. Trying to run that down to third man and a thick edge was found, QDK dived to his right and couldn't get the gloves around in time. Definite chance and what's worse is that it runs away for four.

ENGLAND:20.5 Tahir to Hales, FOUR, Hales goes inside out and finds the gap. Uses his feet and then makes room to go over extra cover. Everyone in on the off-side and that will be four. Sweeper cover was brought in just before the ball and Hales took full toll of that move. Smart batting
ENGLAND:20.4 Tahir to Root, 1 run, tossed up on the stumps, Root gets forward and drives to long-off
ENGLAND:20.3 Tahir to Hales, 3 runs, a top-edged sweep to fine leg, in the gap and Amla runs back to prevent the boundary

ENGLAND:19.2 Wiese to Hales, 1 run, length delivery outside off, run down to third man

ENGLAND:18.6 Tahir to Hales, 1 run, very full on the stumps, wristed to long-on
ENGLAND:18.5 Tahir to Root, 1 run, goes for an encore, but this is too full, off a thick inside edge and down to deep square leg
ENGLAND:18.4 Tahir to Root, FOUR, something had to give and Root goes for the slog-sweep and gets four. Sees the tossed up delivery and goes down to hit it over mid-wicket. Knew there was no-one there and picked his spot to perfection
ENGLAND:18.3 Tahir to Root, no run, the googly, shortish, Root rocks back and punches to short mid-wicket, AB is in the way. Three dots in a row

ENGLAND:17.2 Wiese to Root, 1 run, driven hard and on the rise to sweeper cover, lovely shot but for just one
ENGLAND:17.1 Wiese to Root, no run, length delivery outside off, punched to coverTime for drinks. South Africa will be pleased with their effort. They have been on fire on the field with Faf leading the way. The selection of Wiese has added teeth to their bowling attack. Roy was looking very good but gave it away with a poor piece of running. Root and Hales have strung together a partnership with the latter not looking his fluent self
ENGLAND:16.6 Tahir to Root, 1 run, very full on the stumps, Root gets forward and drives to long-off
ENGLAND:16.5 Tahir to Hales, 1 run, now Hash at backward square leg, dives to his right and saves three. It was swept to his right and he covered good ground and then tumbled

ENGLAND:15.6 Wiese to Root, 1 run, keeps a bit low, Root nudges it through mid-wicket for a single, retains the strike
ENGLAND:15.5 Wiese to Root, no run, again Faf is brilliant. Now to his right and an airborne effort, saves at least a couple. This was driven into the ground and wide of him at backward point, he covered ground and leapt full-length to grab that two-handed. A bit theatrical, the dive bit but a photographer's delight. The crowd once again lap it up
ENGLAND:15.4 Wiese to Hales, 1 run, pushed to mid-off, easy single
ENGLAND:15.3 Wiese to Hales, no run, magnificent from Faf. He has a smile on his face. That is an exceptional stop at backward point. Chopped to his left and he went with one hand, his right and stopped it cleanly, over his head, while stretching full-length.

ENGLAND:15.2 Wiese to Root, 1 run, offie on the stumps, flicked to deep mid-wicket
ENGLAND:15.1 Wiese to Root, no run, back of a length outside off, Root hops back and punches to point. "Wait, wait" is the call from Root
ENGLAND:14.6 Tahir to Hales, no run, now gets forward and defends

ENGLAND:14.4 Tahir to Hales, no run, gets forward and defends to cover
ENGLAND:14.3 Tahir to Root, 1 run, pushed to the right of a diving bowler, that should've been stopped

ENGLAND:13.5 Wiese to Root, FOUR, Root runs at Wiese and gets four. Not off the middle of the bat, dragged wide of a diving mid-on. Came off the inside half of the bat, but once he beat the fielder it was four for the taking
ENGLAND:13.4 Wiese to Hales, 1 run, that is a slog. Desperate heave to a back of a length delivery on the stumps, finds fine leg

ENGLAND:5.5 Rabada to Jason Roy, out Jason Roy Run Out!! 1 run completed. Morkel is all smiles. And why shouldn't he be! It was flashed to his right at third man, he covered ground and rifled a throw in to QDK who whipped the bails off. Slight hesitation between Roy and Hales for the second and that has cost England dear. Roy didn't dive, tried to plonk his bat in as he stretched, was found an inch or two short. QDK collected the throw and then got it to the stumps. Had there been a dive, Roy would've made it. Out of nowhere South Africa grab a wicket. They needed that and the dangerous Roy is gone. Replays show that Roy was ambling along for the single, thinking that it will go to the boundary, then had to run around the bowler, which cost him precious time. Hales never wanted the second, it was Roy who pushed for it and paid the price. Jason Roy run out (M Morkel/de Kock) 20(23) [4s-4]Rabada to Jason Roy, THAT'S OUT!!

ENGLAND:0.5 Kyle Abbott to Jason Roy, no run, pitched up outside off, Jason Roy is on the walk, plays a one-handed drive to mid-off. Looked very awkward while dealing with that

Jason Roy is on strike. Kyle Abbott will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Roy is on strike. Abbott has the ball. Two slips in placeABD: "I was actually gonna bowl first. We know it's pretty nice to control batting second. We got one change. Wiese comes in for Rossouw. He offers a lot with the ball and he is a powerful hitter with the bat too. We have to make it 2-1 today. It's not impossible to win 3 in a row."Morgan: "We will bat first. The surface looks really good. It's a high scoring ground and hopefully we will get the best out of it first up. We have all bases covered and there is no reason why we should change the winning combination. It's great to have Buttler in the side, the way he came and performed was exceptional."So, the news from the centre is that Morgan has called it right and England will be batting first. As expected, England remain unchanged while South Africa swap David Wiese for Rilee Rossouw.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, David Wiese, Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirEngland (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Moeen Ali, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Reece TopleyEngland have won the toss and have opted to batIf a few reports are to be believed, both sides are unlikely to make any changes. However, the weather remains a worrying aspect with chances of rain threatening to curtail the game. Fingers crossed, though! Stick around for the toss and team news...Surprisingly, it's squeaky bum time for the Proteas. Hashim Amla, in a recent press conference, mentioned, "Tomorrow is basically a decider for us. We've got three finals in a row." He was spot on, wasn't he? The Protea bowlers were taken to the cleaners in the first ODI, and unfortunately, de Kock's deadly knock couldn't help the DLS equation. The sun belted out in the second game, but England showed patience and panache to pack another win and now South Africa are staring at a series defeat. Will they bounce back strong or will England continue their rollicking streak? We'll get to know by the end of this game. Mind you! South Africa have never lost both the Test and ODI series to any visiting team since April 2002.Good afternoon all! England's ODI cricket and improvement seem to be best friends nowadays. Since their disastrous show in the 2015 World Cup, they have grown leaps and bounds. Although it had a lot to do with Morgan's aggressive instincts, a mix of tailor-made players, the team has also shown character to dig deep in tough conditions. England have won 2 of their last 3 ODI series and I'm pretty sure a majority of their ODI records were rewritten in the past 12 months - Tells us England have come of age and they could well be a force to reckon in the future. On that note, hello and welcome to our coverage of the third ODI between South Africa and England at Centurion.Preview:If it was Jos Buttler's belligerence that handed South Africa a defeat in the first ODI, it was Alex Hales, who ensured that the hosts have to wait a bit longer to return to winning ways, by taking England to a five-wicket win in the second game.Time is running out for South Africa and they surely wouldn't want another series-loss. The hosts need to win the third One-Day International (ODI) of the five-match series at the SuperSport Park in Centurion to keep the series alive when they take on England on Tuesday (February 9).South Africa are keen to end this run and get back to winning ways. "England are a good side. They are playing some good cricket at the moment, they look confident but they are not unbeatable," said AB de Villiers.South Africa have done well as a batting unit but the bowlers need to pick themselves up. A below par performance allowed England to post 399 in the first game and then in the second game, after having England at 202 for 5, they failed to close the game and ended up conceding the match with 3.4 overs to spare.The biggest positive for the home team in the second match was the way de Villiers went about his business. South Africa were 98 for 3 and he built a 107-run stand with JP Duminy. He was again undone by some brilliant fielding and his promising innings was cut short after a 91-ball 73.England, on the other hand, have had a very successful tour so far and would want to add another trophy before leaving the country. Reece Topley and David Willey have been very impressive with the new ball while Ben Stokes has come on to his own on this tour.South Africa have a tough task ahead of them to stop England but if the kind of arsenal they have clicks, we are in for a cracking contest.Teams:England (From): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Reece Topley, Chris Woakes, Liam Plunkett, Stuart Broad, Jonny Bairstow, James TaylorSouth Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Rilee Rossouw, Farhaan Behardien, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, David Miller, Chris Morris, Marchant de Lange, David WieseLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
