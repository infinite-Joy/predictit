We were also looking bowl first because of the weather. If we can survive the first few overs it must be good. We haven't played cricket for a long time. The guys are fresh and have had a break after the Champions Trophy. We will have to take responsibilty as a batting unit. Umar Akmal and Shahid Afridi are back. Umar will keep wickets.Dwayne Bravo: We will bowl first. It has been a while since we played international cricket here. Overcast conditions should help the bowlers a bit. Hopefully we will restrict them to a decent total. Simmons and Holder are in. Devon Smith is left out. We are excited and looking forward to a good start. The fitness levels are good in the team.

The big news from the Pakistan camp is that Shahid Afridi is back while the trio of Farhat, Malik and Kamran have been axed. Toss and team updates in a while..PreviewDwayne Bravo will begin the five-match one-day international series against Pakistan fully aware he has failed to fire since taking over as West Indies captain.The all-rounder was handed the skipper's role before last month's Champions Trophy, but has since struggled.His team have also failed to find any form, missing out on the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy, before India and Sri Lanka beat them to the final of their own Tri-Series tournament. Bravo takes his side to Guyana for the opening two games of the series against Pakistan, which starts on Sunday, and admits he needs to lead from the front."I really need to actually step up a bit more with my batting, bowling and fielding, in order for the team to do well," he told the Guyana Chronicle. "The team requires me to perform at my best and once I can do that, the team, and by extension West Indies cricket, will benefit some more."Despite that the 29-year-old is confident his side can reverse their poor recent record."I am comfortable with the squad and I am comfortable with each and every player," he said."I know a lot of players had a poor form in the last series. But they are all good players and we know what they did in the past and there is not much I can say to them, but just to make sure they believe in themselves. I have to make sure they continue to back their ability. They have done great for the West Indies in the past and people must not forget that."We all know some persons have short minds in the Caribbean, but just remember the great things they have done for us over the past eight years or so and I am looking forward to the guys who have not done well in the last series, to come forward and do well."Wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin has been left out for the first two games, meaning the Windies will have to decide whether part-timers Lendl Simmons or Johnson Charles - who kept in the Tri-Series - takes the gloves. Pakistan welcome back all-rounder Shahid Afridi for the series, after he was left out of the Champions Trophy, as well as Umar Akmal, who could also keep.
