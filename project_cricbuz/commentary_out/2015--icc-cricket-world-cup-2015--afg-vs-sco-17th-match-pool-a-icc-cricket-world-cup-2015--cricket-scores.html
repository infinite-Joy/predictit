Ahmadi is on strike. Iain Wardlaw will open the attackRecord 9th wicket stand for Scotland has helped them put up a decent total on the board. When they were 144/8, nobody thought 200 was achievable, but Haq and Evans batted sensibly to add 62 runs. Now, upto their bowlers defend this score. Can they restrict Afghanistan? We'll find out soon as the openers make their way out to the middle. Ahmadi takes guard and Mangal will be partnering him. Wardlaw with the new ball. He has a couple of slips in place...Hamid Hassan: 'We are happy with the score. We bowled really well. Their last few batsmen scored quite a few runs though. Hopefully, we can chase this down. If we can see off the new ball, we should get these runs. The pitch becomes easier after the few overs early on. I am enjoying my cricket, these conditions suit me.'For Afghanistan, every bowler chipped away with a wicket, but Dawlat Zadran was the pick of the bowlers. In his 10 overs, he picked up 3 wickets and went for only 29 runs. Even though Shapoor Zadran picked up 4 wickets and was very economical, it was the other Zadran who troubled the batsmen the most. Now, it is upto their batsmen to chase this down. It's not going to be easy though as the ball will do plenty in the first few overs. Whichever team wins this game, it will be their first World Cup win. Join us in a short while to follow the run-chase.Captain Mommsen then joined Machan at the crease and both of them steadied the innings for some time, before Machan had a brain fade and was out bowled, ending the 4th wicket partnership of 53. Mommsen also edged one soon after and half the Scottish side was back in the hut before the team had crossed 100. The lower-order of Berrington, Haq and Evans made useful contributions. In fact, Haq and Evans put on a 62-run record 9th wicket stand for Scotland, to propel the score past 200. It is also the first time that they have registered a 200-plus score in World Cups.Scotland started off poorly, losing MacLeod for a duck. Coetzer and Gardiner then put up a small partnership, before Gardiner was trapped in front by Hassan. Coetzer, who was looking in great touch, got a gaffer that knocked his off stump over and Scotland were 40/3 at that stage. 4

Afghanistan are right on top. They have kept plugging away at the wickets. None of the Scottish batsmen have got going and most of them have failed to convert starts. They need something special from their lower-order to put up a competitive total on the board.
SCOTLAND:32.5 Shapoor to Davey, out Caught by Hamid!! What a celebration! Hamid takes a good low catch. Stays down and stretches his hands in joy. He then tries to do a cartwheel, which he still can't get it right. Remember he did that when he got Sanga out in the previous game. It was a needless shot from Davey, looks to drive the full delivery, doesn't bother to keep it down, picks out mid-off to perfection. Davey c Hamid b Shapoor 1(9)Shapoor to Davey, THATS OUT!!

SCOTLAND:31.1 Nabi to Berrington, no run, Zazai juggled a couple of times before hanging onto this. And as soon as he took it, he called for the review. Nabi was not that confident. The tossed up delivery on middle, Berrington presses forward and misses the defence, the ball turns back in and hits the pad before deflecting to the keeper. There was no inside edge and the ball was just kissing the stumps. Hence the on-field call remainsAfghanistan have reviewed a caught behind appeal. Zazai seemed very confident. No issues with the front foot. Did he get an inside edge? It is close to being lbw as well. If there is no bat involved then they will check if the batsman is out lbw. Snicko does not pick up out anything when the ball passes the bat. So, now we move onto the Hawk-Eye. It pitched in-line and was just clipping the top of the stumps. Berrington survives!

Shapoor is ecstatic as he celebrates with his hands pointing skywards. Matthew Cross c Zazai b Shapoor 15(26) [4s-1]Shapoor to Matthew Cross, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

The Zadrans and Hassan have bowled in the right areas for the most part, barring a few short and wide deliveries that were punished, all three wickets have been owned to poor footwork. This track has some carry on it. If it evens out in the afternoon sun - its 14 degrees right now but expected to warm up - there could be runs on offer.?

SCOTLAND:1.4 Dawlat Zadran to MacLeod, wide, Dawlat still not getting the line right, drifts it down leg, easy call for the umpire
SCOTLAND:1.3 Dawlat Zadran to Coetzer, leg byes, 1 run, once again slips one onto the pads, Coetzer can't connect with the clip and has to be content with a leg byeOur man at the ground, Jamie Alter, has this to say: "Small crowd gathered, mostly supporting Scotland because of Dunedin?s Scottish heritage. But there are a few Afghanistan supporters at deep cover, waving large Afghanistan flags in national attire."
SCOTLAND:1.2 Dawlat Zadran to Coetzer, no run, jaffa! Wasim Akram reckons it was a leg-break. Pitched on middle and shapes away, Coetzer is squared up as he plays down the wrong angle. The extra bounce on the wicket takes it over the stumps. Coetzer has a wry smile on his face, he knows he was beaten neck and crop
SCOTLAND:1.1 Dawlat Zadran to Coetzer, leg byes, FOUR, not a great delivery to start off by Dawlat, splays it down leg, Coetzer can't connect with the glance, the ball brushes the pad and runs away to the fine leg fenceDawlat Zadran, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
SCOTLAND:0.6 Shapoor to MacLeod, no run, too far outside off, MacLeod has no problems in waving it through to the keeper
SCOTLAND:0.5 Shapoor to MacLeod, no run, back of a length around off, MacLeod covers his sticks and shoulders arms. Good carry through to Zazai, who collects it head high
SCOTLAND:0.4 Shapoor to Coetzer, 1 run, the first runs are through a misfield, pitched up just outside off, Coetzer drives it to mid-off, Stanikzai fumbles and allows Coetzer to get off the mark
SCOTLAND:0.3 Shapoor to Coetzer, no run, not much swing for Shapoor, that might be because of the length he is bowling, short and on off, Coetzer jumps up and knocks it down the wicket
SCOTLAND:0.2 Shapoor to Coetzer, no run, short of length and bit of bounce, Coetzer rides it and plays it with soft hands to the left of backward pointNabi has three slips in place..
SCOTLAND:0.1 Shapoor to Coetzer, no run, starts with a back of a length delivery around off, Coetzer goes back and dabs it towards backward pointCoetzer and MacLeod are at the crease. Coetzer is on strike. Shapoor will open the attackThe national anthems of both teams are done. Nabi gathers his team in a huddle before they take the ground. The Scotland openers make their way out to the middle. Coetzer marks his guard as the countdown begins. We are all set for the game to start. Here we go..Pitch Report: "It could just be a little bit tricky for the batsmen, how they manage the off-stump channel. But it looks more Scottish kind of conditions than Afghanistan because there is a lot of grass cover. Having said that, you can still score runs provided that you are disciplined, provided that you see off the new ball. The first 10 overs are going to be critical because there are patches of green, there is a thick layer of grass which must be alien to an Afghanistan cricketer. The average score is 240-250, you should be looking to target that", reckons Rameez RajaTeams:Afghanistan (Playing XI): Javed Ahmadi, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai(w), Gulbadin Naib, Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor ZadranScotland (Playing XI): Calum MacLeod, Kyle Coetzer, Hamish Gardiner, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Majid Haq, Alasdair Evans, Iain WardlawAfghanistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldNabi: "The boys performed well in the last game and hopefully we can perform well in this game as well because the pitch is very good for fast bowling. We will bowl first. It is a totally fresh wicket and we will look to put pressure on the Scotland guys. We have a good fast bowling unit. In the practice session they were looking good and we will try to perform well in this game. Everyone is watching this, watching every game. In Afghanistan it is 2:30 in the night, but everyone is watching the game."Mommsen: "I think the first two games, England and New Zealand, have put us in a better place. We have played a lot of cricket against Afghanistan and hopefully that will work for us today. We need to get some runs on the board and put them under pressure. I think it will remain pretty much the same the whole day. It will have something for us when we bowl. Upfront we need to be tight, we need to get runs on the board. We will have to assess. Obviously the start is fundamental. A partnership platform upfront to give ourselves a chance to get some runs at the back end."Head-to-Head: These two teams have played quite a few times against each other. Afghanistan have the upper hand as they have won 5 out of those 8 games. Will they make it 6 today? Or can Scotland beat them where it matters the most? Stay tuned as the toss and teams are coming up in a short while...ScotlandThe bowling looks alright with Iain Wardlaw leading the pace attack. He is well supported by Alasdair Evans, Josh Davey and the spinner, Majid Haq. Haq was superb in the last game versus England, he slowed it down considerably and ended with figures of 1/51 in his 10 overs. They are a much better fielding side than Afghanistan and it might well turn out to be the difference today.Scotland's first game was against the high flying Kiwis. The New Zealand bowlers used the swinging conditions in Dunedin to good effect as they bowled out Scotland for a paltry 142. Nonetheless, the bowlers did not give up easily as they scalped 7 wickets and made it a bit difficult for the Black Caps to reach the target. In the second game against England, the bowlers once again pulled things back after Moeen Ali's century and were set a target of 304. However, the batting failed yet again. Apart from Kyle Coetzer, no one else showed the application which is needed to beat the big teams.AfghanistanThe three pacers, Shapoor Zadran, Dawlat Zadran and Hamid Hassan have been absolutely brilliant. They have bowled with pace and hit the right areas. If only their batsmen could stand and deliver, Afghanistan will be a difficult team to beat. They will also have to improve their fielding, especially during pressure situations.Afghanistan started their campaign against familiar foes, Bangladesh. They were outplayed by the Tigers. Even though they restricted Bangladesh to 267, the batsmen failed to get going and were rolled over for 162. Against Sri Lanka, they had a very good chance of registering their first win. After Mathews sent them in, Afghanistan batsmen did well to post a competitive 232. In reply, the Asian giants were stuttering at 51/4 before Mahela scored a brilliant hundred and eventually, Thisara Perera got them home with his power-hitting.Today's game also promises to be a cracker. We can term it as the battle of equals. Afghanistan and Scotland come into this encounter with a couple of losses behind them. So, who will come out on top remains to be seen. Let us have a look at the form guide of both the teams.The battle between the Associate nations continues. Yesterday we saw the first close game of the competition and it was played between Ireland and UAE. After being reduced to 131/6, UAE fought back through Shaiman Anwar's hundred to post 278 on the board. Ireland looked down and out and would have lost the game had it not been for the pyrotechnics from Kevin O'Brien and Gary Wilson. Both scored their respective fifties and saw their side through.PreviewOn paper, the 17th match of the 2015 ICC World Cup appears little more than a battle for bragging rights between two of the tournament's less-fancied teams. Neither Scotland or Afghanistan are expected to make it to the quarter-finals, but considering the ICC's plan to shrink the World Cup to ten teams in 2019 and the reduction of opportunities for Associate nations to improve at the highest level, making as many ticks in the W column is of utmost importance to them.At every juncture of Scotland's World Cup campaign, Preston Mommsen has found himself defending his team's position as minnows. He has spoken of how they have nothing to prove because they won matches to qualify for the World Cup, but equally he has emphasised the importance of taking points home because of the make-up of the 2019 tournament. Scotland and Afghanistan have needed to win every match because there is so much riding on the success of the Associates.Scotland have lost both their matches, to New Zealand by three wickets and England by 119 runs, while Afghanistan lost to Bangladesh by 105 runs and Sri Lanka by four wickets. Yet both teams will know that victories were close in one each of their previous games, and that with a bit more runs, they could beat Full Member teams. Right here in Dunedin, Scotland had New Zealand seven wickets down chasing 143 and Afghanistan reduced Sri Lanka to 51 for 5 and then 178 for 6 when defending 233. More is needed, and the two sides should know just what that is.That Scotland have not been competitive enough so far in this World Cup owes largely because not enough players have delivered in tandem. Against New Zealand, from 12 for 4 the team was carried by Matt Machan's 56 and Richie Berrington's 50, but the innings gave way once the pair was separated. Against England, barring Kyle Coetzer's splendid 71 the next best contribution was Mommsen's 26. The hard-hitting opener Calum MacLeod has yet to click, making 0 and 4, and that has meant early pressure on the batting.Despite two defeats, Mommsen could take positives from the team's performance, especially considering that apart from the offspinner Majid Haq, no member of the squad had played in a World Cup before this. "It's been vital to get that experience under the belt and bank that. Obviously, it's one thing talking about playing in a World Cup, but actually doing it, on the day there's so much that goes on, there's far more pressure," he said."But, I think we're better for those two games and the experience of that, and I think we've played good cricket in parts in both those games, but just not for long enough. I think England, the way we came back with the ball in the second half of the first innings was a great credit to our bowlers, to only restrict them to 300. I thought that was a brilliant effort. And with the bat we've threatened at times, just, as I said, not being able to do those good things for long enough and get those bigger partnerships to have a proper crack at chasing those totals. We do take a lot from those first two games."Scotland made two changes for the England game in Christchurch, swapping Hamish Gardiner and Rob Taylor with Freddie Coleman and Alasdair Evans. While Coleman made just 7 at No 3, seamer Evans was the most economic Scotland bowler with 1 for 46 off his ten overs. It is likely that Coleman will be persisted with, because Gardiner doesnt have much form to show for.Afghanistan improved on 162 all out against Bangladesh by posting 232 against Sri Lanka, but they should have gotten more from a scoreline of 138 for 2 after 27 overs. The problem has been starts and finishes - the middle order has done well - and against Scotland, those are areas which they will hope to improve ahead of bigger tests with Australia, New Zealand and England. With allrounder Mirwais Ashraf injured and unlikely to recover for the game, one of Nasir Jamal and Gulbadin Naib could come in."We learned a lot of things from the Sri Lanka game, and hopefully we are doing good against Scotland," said Afghanistan opener Javed Ahmadi. "They are also one of the ICC Associate members and they're doing good in this tournament, as well, so we will try our best and look forward. It's very important for us, especially because both sides are Associate member, and hopefully we beat Scotland strongly. That would be very good because we're showing our country."The two teams have played each other eight times in ODIs, with Afghanistan holding a 5-3 advantage over Scotland. During the Dubai Triangular Series played in January, the two results between the teams were contrasting: in the first, Afghanistan chased down 238 with eight wickets and 42 balls remaining but in the second, set 214, they were bowled out for 63 in 18.3 overs.Mommsen felt that the last match would be added inspiration for Scotland. "We take a huge amount of confidence from that game in Abu Dhabi, huge psychological advantage, I think. We had a clear, clear strategy and tactic against them, and I'm pretty sure that we'll resort to the same formula tomorrow," he said. "In terms of our approach to Afghanistan, yes, I think you will see a slightly different approach in the way we play. Generally, a Scotland-Afghanistan game is quite feisty and there's quite a bit of passion on display, quite a bit of aggression, and I think tomorrow will be no different."Wednesday afternoon was chilly, with temperatures dropping to 12 degrees as drizzle fell on the city, but the forecast for game day is only marginally better. The overcast conditions and Dunedin's Scottish heritage, hoped Mommsen, would work in Scotland's favour. "We're hoping this would almost be like a home game for us with the support that we'll hopefully have tomorrow," he said. "We're used to playing against Afghanistan in the UAE where they have thousands and thousands of support, and that genuinely does make a difference for the way they play. Hopefully for once we'll have more support than they'll have, and that'll give us an extra edge."Teams:Scotland (From): Kyle Coetzer, Calum MacLeod, Freddie Coleman, Matt Machan, Preston Mommsen(c), Richie Berrington, Matthew Cross(w), Josh Davey, Majid Haq, Alasdair Evans, Iain Wardlaw, Rob Taylor, Safyaan Sharif, Michael Leask, Hamish GardinerAfghanistan (From): Javed Ahmadi, Nawroz Mangal, Asghar Stanikzai, Samiullah Shenwari, Mohammad Nabi(c), Najibullah Zadran, Afsar Zazai(w), Mirwais Ashraf, Dawlat Zadran, Hamid Hassan, Shapoor Zadran, Usman Ghani, Aftab Alam, Nasir Jamal, Gulbadin NaibLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
