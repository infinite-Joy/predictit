Result: Match drawn. England had come to India with a set plan to deny Tendulkar easy runs. Their plan was simple to pack the off-side field and force Tendulkar to play across the line. With Ashley Giles in their line-up and expertly led by the astute Nasser Hussain they even tried to frustrate the great man by bowling a negative line outside the leg stump. But at Motera all those plans were foiled as Sachin played a masterful hand of 103. Sachin's ploy to negate the packed off-side cordon was to play forceful whipped shots through the on-side. It was compelling viewing with Hussain plotting every trick in the book and Sachin having an answer to every question posed.

Result: South Africa won by 9 wickets. This Test marked the debut for Virender Sehwag who made a sparkling ton batting at 6, but it was also notable for the brilliant century made by Sachin his 26th Test hundred. The ton was reached in just 114 balls with 23 glorious boundaries and a six punctuating the knock. The feature of this particular knock was the way in which Tendulkar upper-cut the Proteas quick bowlers, utilising the vacant third man area to great effect. During the course of his innings, Tendulkar also became the youngest batsman to reach 7000 Test runs in his 85th match. The innings was so sublime that at one point before lunch Tendulkar hit eight fours in 18 balls. Sadly though it wasn't enough to prevent a thumping South African win.

Rohit is on strike. Rampaul will open the attackWelcome back.. India were used to 350+ chases against Australia. This will come as a welcome relief for them. However, the pitch is not as flat as it was against Australia. We are set for a humdinger of a battle..Test hundred No. 24 - 201* Versus Zimbabwe at Nagpur, November 2000. Result: Match drawn. Tendulkar's 2nd double hundred of his career and a very quick one too it came off just 281 balls and included 27 fours to the fence. It was the Dravid-Tendulkar show again as they put the hapless Zimbabwean bowlers to the sword. They put on 249 runs for the third wicket the second time they had put on a 200+ run stand in the series. No-one troubled Tendulkar as he cruised to his double-ton. But the match will remembered for the astounding batting of Andy Flower who made an unbeaten 232 and helped his side grab a deserving draw which prevented a series whitewash as well.Raina and Jadeja were the pick of the bowlers. Both picked up three wickets each. They were well supported by Ashwin. But the fast bowlers were disappointing as all of them went for above 5 runs per over in a low scoring game. The pitch has started to keep low and will be interesting to see how the Indians batsmen go about the chase. Join us back for the run chase in short while.....Once again it is the same old story for the West Indies with the bat. They won the toss and elected to bat but they lost Gayle early who was run-out thanks to some brilliance by Bhuvneshwar. Samuels and Charles stitched together a nice partnership before spin was introduced. Jadeja and Raina got the two men in quick succession. Then it was the younger Bravo and Simmons who steadied the ship and added 65 runs for the fourth wicket. But Raina once again provided the wicket and broke the partnership. The skipper joined his brother and were looking solid until the batting powerplay was taken. The visitors lost both of them in the powerplay and never came back.4

WEST INDIES:31.1  Raina to Darren Bravo, 1 run, tad short and on off, Bravo stays back and punches it to sweeper coverTest hundred No. 22 - 116 Versus Australia at Melbourne, December 1999. Result: Australia won by 180 runs. When India landed Down Under in 1999, all hopes rested on their skipper and talismanic batsman Sachin Tendulkar. The Boxing Day Test of 1999 was lit up by Tendulkar who made 116 out of India's total of 238. He could forge only one substantial stand with Ganguly and as his partners deserted him one by one, Tendulkar stood firm. Up against a rampant Brett Lee who was making his debut, Tendulkar shepherded the tail and reached his 22nd hundred. Tendulkar managed to save the follow-on but couldn't prevent his side from suffering a heavy defeat.

Result: Match drawn. Tendulkar's first double hundred and his highest first-class score at that point of time came on a sluggish Motera pitch. The Test match itself was a bore, with the pitch offering no assistance to the bowlers, it became a case of piling on the runs and then watch the other team do the same. Tendulkar and Ganguly added 281 for the fourth wicket an Indian Test record at that time. Though Tendulkar was slow by his own lofty standards, he rarely let the loose balls go unpunished. He hit 29 fours and batted for eight and a quarter hours making 217. Well you all know the end result, don't you?

Guess it was a strategy to give Raina a bowl since he bowls wicket to wicket and has more chance of getting such wickets. Samuels b Raina 24(35) [4s-2 6s-1] Raina to Samuels, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Result: Match drawn. Kapil Dev's first match as India coach and it started off disastrously, they were bowled out in 27 overs for 83 with Nash wreaking havoc with a 6-for. But then the pitch flattened out and India made merry in the 2nd dig scoring 505/3 declared. Tendulkar scored his 20th Test hundred but was lucky to survive several close lbw calls, including a first ball appeal against Astle. Clearly hampered by a lack of form, Tendulkar batted slowly and for six and a half hours to notch up his hundred. India declared their innings trying to force a result, but New Zealand managed to achieve a draw even though they went through nervy moments on the final day.

Here we go....We will continue posting Sachin's Test hundreds throughout the ODI series. Today we will post hundreds from 19 to 29.Teams:West Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Johnson Charles(w), Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne Bravo(c), Narsingh Deonarine, Darren Sammy, Sunil Narine, Ravi Rampaul, Jason HolderIndia (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Jaydev UnadkatDhoni: "We were looking to bat first as well. It is humid and the pitch might get slow as the game progresses. We are all fit and there is only one change as Jaydev comes in for Vinay. Even the Bengaluru crowd is bit noisy but we are used to playing in front of such crowds."Bravo: "We will bat first. It is a fresh pitch so we will make use of it. There are a bit of cracks so it might turn later. We will look to be positive and there are 5 to 6 guys coming in. It is important to get over it and play some good cricket in the ODIs. Deonarine is in the team and Ramdin is not playing. We are not going with a specialist keeper."West Indies have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "There are quiet a bit of cracks. It has rained as well so that might effect the captains decision. The average score is around 220-230 but it will be a high scoring game", says Ravi ShastriAfter an emotional affair in the Test series we are all set for the ODIs to begin. India are on a high after the series win against Australia. The top order of Dhawan, Rohit and Kohli are all in good form. All three got hundreds in the Australia series. The middle order of Yuvraj and Raina did not get going and that was because of some good hostile fast bowling from Johnson. But they will look for this 3-match series to get some runs under their belt. The West Indies team has a new look when it comes to ODIs. Some of the stars like Narine, Charles return with their skipper Dwayne Bravo. The guys coming in would like to make a statement after some of the others were criticised for the poor show in the Tests. We will get you the teams and toss in a few minutes....The Preview, by Nikhil NarainIt is always hard to say, 'good-bye', always difficult to get over emotional farewells and ever so much more when the person bidding adieu is Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar. As the nation and its billion inhabitants still recover from the proceedings of November 16th, 2013 in Mumbai, an ODI series gets underway some 1500 kms away in the south-western coastal city of Kochi - for as they say, 'The Show Must Go On!'The Nehru Stadium will play host to the first of the three ODIs between India and the West Indies. India sit pretty at the top of the ODI rankings while the team from the Caribbean languishes at number 7. India were victorious 3-2 over Australia in a run-extravaganza just prior to the West Indies tour. While their batsmen tormented and annihilated the Australian bowling attack and made mountainous chases seem like a walk in the park, its the bowlers who would be giving the Indian captain, MS Dhoni sleepless nights and turning his hair white.The West Indies, meanwhile, need to show some fight and gusto after capitulating within three days in both the Tests in Kolkata and Mumbai. A change in leadership is most welcome, given the fact that Darren Sammy went wicketless in whites. Clive Lloyd accused the West Indies of suffering from a T20 hangover in the Test series. A fitting reply for Dwayne Bravo's men would be to go out on an ODI high!IndiaIndia would start as favourites and once again look to their batsmen to provide the goods. Rohit Sharma with 1071 runs from 22 innings is the third highest run-getter in ODIs in 2013. He has hit a purple patch and recently became only the third batsmen in history (after Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar) to register a double ton in ODI cricket. Shikhar Dhawan is not far behind and is just 9 short of 1000 aggregate runs himself for the calendar year. Virat Kohli has amassed a staggering 1033 runs at 54.36 per dismissal at a strike rate of 97.63 in 2013. The top-3 will be followed by the likes of Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh. The latters's form will be the only cause of worry in the Indian camp. MS Dhoni is one of the best finishers in the game's history and with Ravindra Jadeja back in the mix, India's batting looks strong and intimidating. The bowling needs redemption. Ishant Sharma was the first casualty of the Australian ODI tour and unless urgent measures are adopted, the West Indies batting line-up is well capable of benching a few more Indian bowlers especially if the nature of the wickets continues to aid batsmen. Mohammad Shami's sudden rise in the Test series augurs well for the Indian team. Dhoni has insisted that his fast bowlers have been training hard in the nets practisng yorkers for the death. India would be hoping that R Ashwin and Jadeja can fox the West Indian batsmen with their guile and spin.West IndiesThe West Indian batting line-up is top heavy. The big three - Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo and Marlon Samuels would need to fire and do the bulk of the scoring. Gayle hasn't had a great year but averages 55.85 in India. He has six tons from 22 ODI appearances. Bravo and Johnson Charles have been their most prolific run-scorers in 2013 with 614 and 612 aggregate runs respectively. Dwayne Bravo and Darren Sammy would need to provide the impetus coming lower down the order.Ravi Rampaul will lead the West Indian pace attack and would be supported by Jason Holder. The latter at 6 feet, 7 inches could pose a few questions for the famed Indian batting with his bounce and pace. But it will be Sunil Narine who would hold the trump card to their fortunes. The crafty off-spinner has 23 wickets from 19 ODI innings in 2013. Although skipper Bravo is ahead in the wickets tally, it is the economy rate of 4.53 which is the outstanding statistic for the spinner.Stats Trivia- Ravindra Jadeja with 46 wickets is the second highest wicket-taker in ODIs in 2013.- Virat Kohli is just 81 runs short of 5000 runs in ODI cricket. Should he get there at Kochi, he would equal Viv Richards' record of the fastest to 5000 (114 innings).- Ravi Rampaul with 93 ODI wickets needs 7 more to become the 14th West Indian to reach the landmark of 100.- India beat the West Indies 4-1 in the last bilateral ODI series between the two countries in India in 2011.Pitch and ConditionsRains are predicted throughout the day and could well play spoilsport for the opener. The wicket might be a little damp and moist and may assist the faster men with the two new balls. Otherwise, a run-feast is expected and the bowlers may have their task cut out.QuotesWe are aware of playing the world champions. We respect their strengths but at the same time we know what we need to do to win matches: West Indies skipper, Dwayne BravoWest Indies are a good team. It is a different squad for the ODIs and the West Indian players coming in are well-suited for the 50-over format: Indian captain, MS DhoniTeams:India (From): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Vinay Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Amit Mishra, Ambati Rayudu, Mohit Sharma, Jaydev UnadkatWest Indies (From): Chris Gayle, Johnson Charles, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Bravo(c), Narsingh Deonarine, Denesh Ramdin(w), Darren Sammy, Sunil Narine, Tino Best, Ravi Rampaul, Jason Holder, Veerasammy Permaul, Kieran Powell, Lendl SimmonsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
