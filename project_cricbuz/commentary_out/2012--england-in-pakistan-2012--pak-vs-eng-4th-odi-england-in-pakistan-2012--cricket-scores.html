ENGLAND:80.75 80.75.Cook: It's been a really good week and a half for us. We had a challenge to do well in the ODI series and all the boys did well. We tried to rotate some players after we won the series and I think Dernbach did really well today. We have couple of niggles in our batting line up so I am staying for the T20s as well.Misbah: We have to look forward and forget this ODI series. Today we batted well, but lots of positives to take from this series. Many of our batsmen couldn't convert good starts to a big score and that affected us. But full marks to the way Cook and KP played. We tried and picked 4 spinners in this game, but England had a strong batting line-up.KP: I am extremely happy with my knock as it was very special for me and it helped us win the series. We trained very hard after the Test series and that helped us. Opening the batting was a new experience for me. I altered my technique a bit as DRS had affected my batting. I am looking forward for the T20 series now.KP is the Man of the Match for his match winning innings of 130 off 153 balls.Clinical performance from England helps them to whitewash Pakistan 4-0 in the ODI series. Everyone had written them off after their dismal performance in the Test series, but they have made a brilliant come back to clinch the series. KP was the difference in this match as he single-handedly took his team through, but got out in the end, when his team needed just 2 runs. Yet again in this match, Pakistani batsmen failed to capitalise on excellent starts and in the end they were short by some 50 runs. Kieswetter also played his part and stitched an important stand of 109 for the 5th wicket and that took the game away from Pakistan. Afridi's bowling form was also a cause of concern for them in this series as in the recent past they had relied heavily on him. Stay tuned for the presentation...

England openers will find it hard against the Pak spinners as they are playing only one fast bowler in their eleven today.Excellent bowling performance from England has helped them to restrict Pakistan to under 250.

But they lost wickets in the middle and also couldn't find boundaries regularly in the slog overs. This looks like an easy chase for England and they will be looking for a series whitewash after their disastrous Test series. Do join us in about 35 minutes for the chase.....4

We have couple of injuries. Ravi has a sore back. Briggs and Butler are playing their first match. This is our last game of the tour and I would like to finish it on a winning note.Misbah: We are batting first. We have lots of injuries in our side. Farhat is out and Malik is coming back into the side. We are resting Gul and lot of players are sick. We are not capitalising on the good starts and we are working on it. Junaid Khan and Rehman replace Gul and Cheema.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to batHello and welcome to the live coverage of the last match of this 4-match ODI series between Pakistan and England. England are 3-0 up in the series and will be looking for a whitewash, while Pakistan will be searching for their first win in this series after their impressive show in Tests, where they snubbed England 3-0. Cook is in his form of his life and he's lead his side pretty well and they are looking like a better unit compared to the team which played in the Tests. Toss is about 15 minutes away and stay tuned for further updates....Preview by Ganesh CEngland have defied all expectations by winning all three matches on the trot and with that the series. Pakistan will be hurt more by the ease with which England clinched the series. As is the case with all dead rubbers, the side that is down - Pakistan in this series - will be looking to salvage some pride from the lone remaining game. England on the other hand will be looking to extend this new found winning streak in ODIs. A few changes are expected in both sides as they get read to face off at Dubai.Pakistan:There could be a lot of emotions riding in the Pakistan dressing room. Mohsin Khan, their coach, who has forged a very good working relationship with skipper Misbah ul Haq faces the prospect of mnaking way for a new coach after this game. If that is indeed the case, then Pakistan will be doubly motivated to send him off with a win.The batting has been a cause of worry for Pakistan in shorter formats for a long time. It stems from the top where Imran Farhat has clearly failed to deliver. The third ODI was Farhat's 50th game for Pakistan and he has just one hundred against his name. That came as far back as 2003. Hammad Azam, an all-rounder in the squad has experience in opening the batting and could make his way into the eleven at the expense of Farhat. The future in ODIs for a few other batsmen too look bleak and it may well be a make or break game for them.The bowlers carried Pakistan to the semi final of the World Cup last year and as a group pose lesser worries than the collective failure of the batsmen. Umar Gul is in line for a well deserved rest but it remains to be seen how Pakistan approach this game. Will they be willing to rest their senior bowler even as they go all out for a win?England:A lot of positives has emerged for England from this tour. Alastair Cook, the skipper, has not only found his feet in ODIs but has made appreciable progress as a captain too. Steven Finn is slowly maturing into a complete bowler. The biggest of them though will be the return of form of Kevin Pietersen. He is a genuine match winner for England and the move to promote him to the top of the order seems have done a lot of good.The middle order though is yet to have a settled look. Jonathan Trott has not matched his previous exploits and this game offers him a chance to get back into form. It will also be interesting to see if England persist with Craig Kieswetter with the likes of Johnny Bairstow and Jos Buttler waiting in the wings. He got to bat only once in the series but did not make much of an impression though he has been pretty consistent in previous series'.England is spoilt for choices in the bowling department. Steven Finn has been the standout performer with all the others chipping in with vital contributions along the series. It is also here that they can ideally test someone like the young left arm spinner, Danny Briggs without affecting the balance.They will not be resting on the laurels because a series sweep is a possibility and that is enough motivation for them to come out all guns blazing.Quotes:We give away 20-30 runs in every match while England save 20-30 with their fielding so it comes to a 40 run difference - Mohsin Khan, Pakistan coach.Where we are is fifth in the world; where we want to be is number one in the world by the World Cup in 2015 - Eoin Morgan Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Ravi Bopara, James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Jonathan Trott, Tim Bresnan, Jonathan Bairstow, Danny Briggs, Jos Buttler, Jade Dernbach, Craig Kieswetter(w), Samit PatelPakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdur Rehman, Aizaz Cheema, Adnan Akmal, Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq, Imran Farhat, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Gul, Umar Akmal(w), Younis Khan, Wahab Riaz, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Hammad AzamLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
