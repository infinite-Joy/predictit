A defeat in the opening match will make the task of qualifying for the tournament extremely difficult, and with both Oman and Hong Kong set to later face Afghanistan, the strongest side in the qualifiers, a winning start would be crucial to their chances.The two sides have faced off against each other thrice, during a bilateral Twenty20 International series in November 2015, and Oman emerged victorious on two occasions.Unlike most other Associate Nations, Hong Kong are dependent on their batting. However, the absence of big hitters in the side, will leave them majorly handicapped in the contest. Even as they have featured in the 50-over format of the Asia Cup earlier, on current form, Oman, the latest cricketing nation on the rise, hold an edge.Oman's rise in cricket has been phenomenal over the last one year. Much like what Afghanistan achieved four-five years ago, they are aiming to make a mark at the world stage. On Friday, begins their big test. Will they ace it or fall short, will be interesting to witness.Teams:Oman (From): Sultan Ahmed(w/c), Aaqib Sulehri, Amir Ali, Bilal Khan, Ajay Lalcheta, Rajeshkumar Ranpura, Vaibhav Wategaonkar, Zeeshan Siddiqui, Mohammad Nadeem, Aamir Kaleem, Adnan Ilyas, Munis Ansari, Jatinder Singh, Mehran Khan, Sufyan Mehmood, Zeeshan Maqsood, Khawar Ali, Yousuf Al BalushiHong Kong (From): Tanwir Afzal(w/c), Anshuman Rath, Christopher Carter, Haseeb Amjad, Nadeem Ahmed, Kinchit Shah, Tanveer Ahmed, Waqas Khan, Aizaz Khan, Babar Hayat, Mark Chapman, Adil Mehmood, Nizakat Khan, Ninad ShahLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
