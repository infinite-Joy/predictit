I was struggling initialy, then when I came out of international cricket I worked hard in the domestic circuit and concentrated on my technique. The fact that I learned from my mistakes is the reason why I made a comeback. I think the youngsters should just take heart from my story and they should know that you can always come back. In the early part of my career I didn't concentrate much on my bowling, I was always a natural batsman but now I have started paying more attention to my bowling as well and I get a lot of help from Afridi.Pitch report: With no rain around for 2 days, the pitch is a bit dry. It will assist the faster bowlers, but the spinners will not get much turn. Little bit of rain is expected in the later part of the day.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Azhar Ali, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Sohail Tanvir, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Gul, Rahat AliSri Lanka (Playing XI): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Upul Tharanga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews, Thissara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Lasith MalingaMisbah: This wicket looks a bit dry, but will will try to restrict them. Our fast bowlers are doing very well at the moment and we have a very balanced attack. Sami is not playing because of the thumb injury and Rahat replaces him.Mahela: We will bat first again and hopefully we will put up a good score this time around. It didn't rain yesterday, so less moisture in the wicket. We will look to be consistent with our performance. We are going with the same side.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batHello and welcome to the coverage of the second ODI between Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Pakistan's bowlers set up a comfortable victory in the first game and the visitors will be keen to continue their dominance over the hosts in recent times. Sri Lanka on the other hand have plenty to worry about, especially their batting line up. The first game was affected by frustrating rain delays and we hope we get uninterrupted action today. Stay tuned for the toss and other updates..Preview by Gokul GopalJust like Pakistan were found wanting in all departments in the opening T20I, It was Sri Lanka's turn to be overwhelmed as Pakistan won the opening ODI quite comfortably to take the lead in the five match series. Going into the second One Dayer, Misbah ul Haq will be hoping that his side extends the winning momentum while Mahela Jayawardene will be hoping for his team to come up with an improved effort and square the series.Sri Lanka: It was a collective failure on part of the batters that led to Sri Lanka's loss in the first game of the ODI series. Sri Lanka's ODI form in the recent times has not been all that good and the main reason for that is that the batsmen have failed to provide the team with anything substantial. This trend has continued into the current series and the batting woes is hurting Sri Lanka pretty badly. Even in the preceding T20I series, the batsmen were not upto the mark, with the top order, including the likes of Dilshan, Sangakkara and Mahela, failing to contribute. It was even worse in the 1st ODI as none of the batsmen showed any inclination to stay put in the crease and build a platform, barring Lahiru Thirimanne. If Sri Lanka are to counter the powerful bowling line up of Pakistan then the batsmen need to stand up and make their performances count. The coach and the skipper would probably have said the same in the team meeting but unless the effort is shown on the ground, Sri Lanka will soon be in danger of losing their 4th bilateral ODI series against Pakistan at home.As far as the Lankan bowlers are concerned, they have not been able to do much as the batsmen have failed to provide them with something worth defending. Despite that, there has been no dearth of spirit as the likes of Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Angelo Mathews and Rangana Herath have been going hard at the Pakistani batsmen and have kept them on the toes. All Mahela will be hoping for is a strong performance from Sri Lanka's batsmen including himself, which in turn will enable the bowlers to have a larger say in the proceedings.Pakistan: Pakistan have won 9 of the last 11 ODIs against Sri Lanka and the main reason for that is that the team has performed as an unit. The bowlers are specially to thank for that as they have been pretty consistent in their endeavours, not letting the Lankan batsmen to dictate terms to them. A quality line up with the likes of Umar Gul, Sohail Tanvir, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez is no doubt a tough proposition for the opposition, but these bowlers have never let down the steam and have rendered one successful performance after another. The opening ODI also saw a similar showing with regular bowlers like Gul and Hafeez shining with the ball. But what the selectors would have been most pleased about is the performance of Mohammad Sami, who returned to ODI cricket with a bang, coming up with a commendable effort with the ball. The skipper will be counting on the bowlers to continue their good showing throughout the series.While the bowlers have been on target, Pakistan's main concern will be with the batting department, specifically the top order. While they do have solid batsmen like Mohammad Hafeez, Azhar Ali and Younis Khan in the top 3, they have failed to get off to good starts. There have also been a few occasions when despite getting a start, Pakistan have been unable to capitalize. In the previous match too, Hafeez batted solidly but the quick wickets of Azhar and Younis meant that Pakistan had to graft for a while and could not secure a victory as comfortably as they would have hoped for when they restricted Sri Lanka to 135. Although it was a hard-working pitch for the batsmen, there could been some better shot selection. Misbah will be hoping that these chinks are rectified sooner than later and will also be expecting a better fielding performance from his team, considering the number of catches dropped and the lapses in the field.Stats:# Umar Gul has the most number of ODI wickets at Pallekele. He has picked up nine wickets in three matches. (Gul's bowling figures - Ave: 10.22. SR: 17.7. Econ: 3.45).#In 5 matches played at Pallekele so far, only twice has a total in excess of 200 been achieved. On both occasions, it was by the team batting first and they went past 300.Quotes:Pakistan's track record in the last six months against us has been pretty good and it was up to us to try and change that: Mahela Jayawardene following the loss in the opening ODI.We have to improve in these conditions - it's a windy and open ground. It's difficult to judge, so we have to work hard: Misbah ul Haq wants a better performance from his batters.Teams:Pakistan (From): Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Sami, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Akmal, Umar Gul, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdur Rehman, Aizaz Cheema, Asad Shafiq, Azhar Ali, Imran Farhat, Rahat Ali, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Younis KhanSri Lanka (From): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Thissara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Upul Tharanga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Jeevan Mendis, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Pradeep, Dilhara FernandoLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
