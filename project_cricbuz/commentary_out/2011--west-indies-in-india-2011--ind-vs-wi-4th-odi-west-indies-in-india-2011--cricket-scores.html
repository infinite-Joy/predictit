Simmons is on strike. Vinay Kumar will open the attackTwo slips in place.We are just a few minutes away from the start of the West Indies innings. They must be feeling very demoralized at the moment. However, what can one say about Sehwag? The thought of a double century in ODIs seemed preposterous. However, in the last two years, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag have both scored double centuries. Both did it in Madhya Pradesh. And on that note, this is Sid V to take you through for the first half of the West Indies innings.Sehwag: I was telling Gambhir that if we are patient, we can get big runs here. The wicket was good, the outfield was fast and the boundaries were short. True batting wicket, you just have to spend some time and carry on with the shots. I picked the gaps and when I hit it straight, it went for sixes. Thanks to my family and friends. Our top order was not contributing and we needed starts. I never changed my style of play, I played my shots throughout, I just wanted to score runs in the batting powerplay and knew I would get there if I stay on the wicket. When Sammy dropped that catch, I thought god was with me and I just wanted to stay till the 45th over. I am 33 years now, I am an old man and my back is stiff, I will have an ice bath and try to get back on the field.History will remember this match for one man: Virender Sehwag. Indian fans will remember this match for 2 men: Virender Sehwag and Darren Sammy. The West Indies skipper will not sleep well today. Sehwag was on 170 when Sammy dropped a simple chance. Nobody in the stadium could believe he dropped that, but as Sehwag himself said, probably god was on his side. That was the only chance in an otherwise scintillating display of strokeplay, which lasted 47 overs. The 200 barrier was always expected to be broken by Sehwag, and he chose this day to do it. Poor West Indies were at the receiving end. Does anyone remember that Sehwag needed some runs badly before the match started? Don't think this match will be remembered for anything else, but there is an entire West Indies innings left. Join us at 18:40 IST.4
INDIA:49.6  Roach to Virat Kohli, FOUR, it is only fitting that India end their innings with a boundary. Everything has gone to plan, and the finish is fitting as well.

He looked to smash a length delivery straight down the ground, but I suspect it was a slower one, he didn't have much pace to work with so ended up mistiming it to the man at long off. End of a stunning and entertaining knock from Sehwag. He walks off to a standing ovation from the crowd and his dressing room. Sehwag c (sub)Anthony Martin b Pollard 219(149) [4s-25 6s-7] Pollard to Sehwag, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

INDIA:45.5  Rampaul to Sehwag, FOUR, mid off is inside the circle, and Sehwag will not miss out. Full and straight, would have been a normal delivery but Sehwag decides to back away and loft it over the man at mid off, Russell the fielder leaps in vain as it sails over him
INDIA:45.4  Rampaul to Rohit Sharma, 1 run, Rampaul responds with a slower one, Rohit pushes it to the on side for a single
INDIA:45.3  Rampaul to Rohit Sharma, FOUR, hardest hit of the match and it is not from Sehwag! Good length and outside off, Rohit Sharma clears his frontfoot and smashes it along the ground extremely hard and wide of the man at extra cover, went to the boundary even before anyone turned

INDIA:43.6  Andre Russell to Sehwag, SIX, what a shot! Remember Waqar Younis to Sehwag in the 2003 World Cup? Similar shot now. Short and rising on the off, he makes room and backs away, slashes at it and hits the upper cut for a huge six. He is yet to stop guys, hold on.

Everyone in the world knew he would get there someday, and today is that day. Dramatical scenes here, someone, probably a ground official runs in with a bunch of flowers and presents it to Sehwag, who looks quite stunned by the quickness of the appreciation. Did I forget to mention how he got there? Oh dear, yes I did. Anyways here it is: he went back to this short and cut it away through point for a boundary. Only deserving that the landmark should be reached with a four, and he did exactly thatRohit Sharma, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:43.2  Andre Russell to Ravindra Jadeja, out Caught by Rampaul!! RJ goes, but I am pretty sure none of the Indian fans care.

Ravindra Jadeja c Rampaul b Andre Russell 10(10) Andre Russell to Ravindra Jadeja, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Or does anyone remember what happened in Melbourne in 2003, when he was batting on 195?Andre Russell [6.0-0-50-0] is back into the attack
INDIA:42.6  Pollard to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, looks to come down the track and work it away, but it's a slower one again. He gets deceived by it and plays the shot too early, gets hit on the body

INDIA:41.6  Sammy to Sehwag, 2 runs, goes past Viv Richards and Sanath Jayasuriya now, with a bit of help from Sammy again! Poor stuff this from West Indies, they look completely out of sorts. Sehwag steers it to short third man and takes a single, the throw from there went to long on, who lobbed it back to Sammy.

INDIA:40.2  Roach to Raina, out Raina Run Out!!1 run completed. Second run out of the match. The bowlers are not getting wickets, the captain drops a sitter, but they have been doing well when it comes to running batsmen out. Raina punches it down to long off and ambles for one, Sehwag looks to convert the single and calls Raina who hesitates but goes on, the fielding in the deep is sharp and Russell fires in an accurate throw to the keeper, who catches him well short. Nice little innings from Raina come to an end. Raina run out (Andre Russell/Ramdin) 55(44) [4s-6] Roach to Raina, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Third umpire called. Raina looks in trouble. He is OUT.

However, Sehwag was not offering any shot

INDIA:37.5 Rampaul to Sehwag, 1 run, catch dropped by Sammy. UNBELIEVABLE. There is only one word for that : SITTER. Sehwag looks to loft this over covers but the bat turns in his hands, ends up carving it uppishly to covers, Sammy has to move across to his left but he had enough time, it came at a comfortable height but somehow, the ball came out of his hands. The crowd probably had a mini heart attack, but recover well and shout their throats off. Rampaul is stunned, Sehwag smiles.

INDIA:36.5  Andre Russell to Sehwag, SIX, terrific batting! Not too short, but Sehwag goes back in a flash, trusts the bounce on the track and just lifts it with a straight bat over deep mid wicket. Flat track + small boundaries + Virender Sehwag = problems for the bowlers!

INDIA:35.3  Marlon Samuels to Sehwag, 2 runs, 2nd 150+ score for Sehwag! Misses out on a boundary opportunity again, picks the full toss and heaves it to the left of deep mid wicket, Pollard was the fielder there and he puts in a dive to save the boundary. What an innings this has been

INDIA:35.1  Marlon Samuels to Sehwag, 1 run, that could have been hit anywhere but Sehwag picks the man at deep mid wicket, pulls this short one straight to the fielder there, he knows he has missed out on a scoring chance, and shares a big smile with Marlon Samuels.

Sehwag is batting on 147, and you can sense the excitement already. Talks about the 200 have already started, and I am sure the man will have it in his mind as well. Will he? Won't he?

INDIA:32.2  Narine to Sehwag, FOUR, shot! That has been blasted down the ground. Doesn't matter which way it will turn, Sehwag dances down the track and smashes it straight over Narine for another four, and I thought he was respecting the bowler in the previous over!

INDIA:27.1  Marlon Samuels to Sehwag, 1 run, flat half volley on the off stump, Sehwag drives it hard down to long off, not a typical forward drive, it was more of a bottom handed drive like Dhoni plays

INDIA:26.5  Rampaul to Raina, 2 runs, much straighter this time, Raina stays back and works it through mid wicket, the running is good and the 1 becomes 2

He did not even shake Sehwag's hand after the toss. He is in utter disbelief that he lost another toss but has a smile later on.Sammy: I didn't even hear what he said. Could not believe I lost another toss. The one day wickets have been really good. There is something for the bowlers and the batsmen can play their shots. Bravo is injured and Powell will come in and play at the top of the order.Sehwag: We will bat first. It's a good track to bat on. It will spin later on so it is a good option. You have to play well for 100 overs to win the game. We love to play in front of such crowds. Rahul Sharma is in for Umesh.India have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: There is a little grass on the track and it will aid the fast bowlers. The bounce should stay true too throughout the game and aid the strokemakers. The dew could be a factor under lights.Hello and welcome to our coverage of the crucial fourth game in this series. West Indies will be quite upbeat after their win in the third game. They will be raring to make it 2-2. India, on the other hand, will go all out to win the series in this game. Irfan Pathan is likely to figure in the eleven and should be a direct replacement for Umesh Yadav unless Sehwag and the management have other plans. Darren Bravo is out for West Indies and they will be forced to make changes too. Stay on as we bring you the eleven and the toss in just a short while.Preview by Karthik LakshmananWest Indies' tour of India has been much more competitive than what the scoreline suggests. Not many gave the visitors a chance of doing well in India, but they have fought hard and competed well, right from the start of the Test series, though they lost it 0-2. The ODI part of the tour started in a similar fashion; though the West Indies competed, they failed. However, the victory in the third ODI might well turn out to be the turning point of the tour and give the visitors some much needed lift in spirits. India: The hosts have made only one change to the squad that played the first 3 games, with Irfan Pathan replacing Umesh Yadav, who has to leave early for the Australian tour. The replacement should be a good boost to the batting line up more than the bowling attack, as it is India's batsmen who have uncharacteristically failed in home conditions. The batting woes for India start right at the top - Sehwag, Gambhir and Parthiv Patel are yet to put up a meaningful score in the tournament, which has made the batting line up heavily reliant on Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. The duo, likely to compete for the number 6 spot in Australia, have handled the responsibility well and have been sturdy in the middle order. Rohit Sharma, who is making a comeback from injury, in particular is having a dream series; he has scores of 72, 90 not out and 95 in the 3 matches. India will also hope for the lower middle order to come to the party - Suresh Raina has neither had luck nor runs come his way so far, but R Ashwin has shown ability with the bat.India's main concerns in the bowling line up will be the way the bowlers have succumbed to pressure in the death overs. India's pacers start well with the new ball but often allow the opposition to recover and punish them in the death. The strong batting line up often masks this concern, but West Indies made them pay in the 3rd ODI, where India allowed Darren Sammy and Andre Russell to put on an unbeaten 79 run partnership in just 34 balls. The pick of the bowlers so far have been Vinay Kumar and Umesh Yadav - the duo have consistently given the early breakthroughs and put West Indies in pressure early in the innings. India will be without the latter for the remaining 2 matches, and would hope that the replacement (likely to be Irfan Pathan) can continue the good work.West Indies: West Indies have twice managed to get out of jail thanks to an attacking lower order which has the likes of Russell, Sammy and Rampaul. The rescue acts by the tail may be exciting, but the hosts would know that they need more runs from their top order. The job may get tougher for them, as Darren Bravo - the only consistent West Indies batsman of the tour is not available; he was forced to retire hurt during his team's batting due to a hamstring injury and has been ruled out of the fourth ODI as well. Simmons, Samuels, Pollard and Ramdin have shown glimpses of their talent in various stages and they need to make it big, of West Indies are to stay alive in the series.There are lesser problems in the bowling line up for West Indies. Roach and Rampaul have been among the wickets and have been well supported by the likes of Samuels and Russell. The find of the tour has been Sunil Narine, the mystery spinner who made a good start to his international career and picked up 2 for 34 from his 10 overs in his debut match at Ahmedabad. Watch out for:Irfan Pathan: Many people expected the all-rounder to be on the plane to Australia after his good performances in the Ranji season, but he finds himself playing ODI cricket against West Indies. He will not mind it at all, and would want to seal his spot in the national team.Sunil Narine: The spinner had a good debut and may turn out to be a trouble for India.
