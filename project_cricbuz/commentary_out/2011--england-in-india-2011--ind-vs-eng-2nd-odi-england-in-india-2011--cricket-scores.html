INDIA:21.1  Swann to Virat Kohli, no run, Bairstow now dives to his right at mid wicket and saves some runs. Flicked well and a good effort from Bairstow kept it to a dot.Graeme Swann [3.0-0-13-0] is back into the attackSwann comes back for another spell. A short leg is in place.
INDIA:20.6  Finn to Virat Kohli, 3 runs, What timing! Just a backfoot defence. Nothing more than that. It went wide of Bairstow at point and only a desperate slide from Bopara saved a run. The umpires are checking whether Bopara's effort was clean. The official broadcasters aren't bothered about that, and continue to plug in more ads. 3 it is. No replay, but Virat Kohli is on strike, so I'm assuming that effort from Bops was clean.

INDIA:18.1  Finn to Virat Kohli, no run, full and on off, Virat Kohli drives and finds mid onSteven Finn [5.0-0-28-0] is back into the attackFinn comes back with two slips in place. Will he have better luck in this spell?

INDIA:16.5  Bopara to Gambhir, no run, Bopara gets through Gambhir's defences with an yorker. Gambhir just about got his bat down in time. And had the presence of the mind to go into his crease and try to stop it with his bat as it seemed to be dribbling onto the stumps

INDIA:16.1  Bopara to Gambhir, 1 run, whipped from middle stump line to deep square leg
INDIA:15.6  Swann to Gambhir, 1 run, the English are appealing for everything now. First for LBW and then for a run-out. Neither of them is out.

INDIA:14.5  Bopara to Virat Kohli, FOUR!!, fine leg is up in the circle and that's a horrid ball. On middle stump and angling down, Virat Kohli closes the face of the bat too tickle it past that man and the deep square leg is too wide to cut it off. The Delhi boys on their home ground doing the job for India.

INDIA:13.5  Swann to Gambhir, FOUR!!, What.A.Shot! Not all that short, but Gambhir has almost hit Kies with that cut shot. Took it from the keepers gloves and then played a deft cut shot that left backward point gasping in admiration even as the ball sped away to the fence. Superb foot-work and even better presence of mind from Gambhir to use the slight angle on that delivery to get a boundary. A left-handers delight that shot. BCL used to be the master of that shot.

INDIA:12.5  Dernbach to Virat Kohli, FOUR!!, that's why this fella is special. A huge grunt from Dernbach as he delivered the short ball, but Virat Kohli swivelled and powerfully pulled it away in the air over mid wicket and the ball raced away to the fence.

INDIA:12.1  Dernbach to Virat Kohli, FOUR!!, the second slip has been taken out and the edge goes straight there. Would've been a dolly to that man. Instead it runs away to the fence. Cook has an apologetic look at Dernbach. Back of a length outside off, Virat Kohli pushed tentatively and the edge flew through the vacant area. Virat Kohli has a wry smile on his face and then shows some glove-love with Gambhir.
INDIA:11.6  Swann to Virat Kohli, 1 run, a regulation off break is turned through mid wicket. No wicket for Swann in his opening over this time.
INDIA:11.5  Swann to Gambhir, 1 run, a sharp single taken to Dernbach at cover. Long on tidies up after Dernbach fires in a strong throw. Gambhir was well in though

INDIA:9.6  Finn to Gambhir, no run, now the edge drops short of third slip. What an over from Finn. He could've had Gambhir thrice, but the over has cost him 12. Cricket can be such a cruel game. Gambhir pushed forward and the lack of bounce in this wicket, didn't carry to the edge to Bresnan. Finn is frustrated and walks off chuntering to himself. Super effort from him though. Gambhir will feel lucky that he has survived that over. Some over that. All action!
INDIA:9.5  Finn to Gambhir, no run, back to front-foot defence. Finn is still chuntering away
INDIA:9.4  Finn to Gambhir, FOUR!!, now adding insult to injury is Gambhir. Overpitched on the pads and that's too easy for someone like Gambhir. Flicked through the vacant square leg area. Vast acres of land vacant in that area and that has been used to good effect by Gambhir. Third boundary of the over.
INDIA:9.3  Finn to Gambhir, FOUR!!, Finn isn't impressed at that effort from a diving Samit Patel at third man. It was an edge and went wide of Bresnan at third slip. Didn't carry though and beat a desperate dive from the big man. Too much pace on that and Finn feels that should've been stopped
INDIA:9.2  Finn to Gambhir, no run, tight stuff from Finn. On the stumps and Gambhir is on his toes before defendingThree slips in for Finn now.
INDIA:9.1  Finn to Gambhir, FOUR!!, now the inside edge misses the stumps. No luck for Finn. Full and wide outside off, Gambhir looked to drive through cover and the ball almost shaved the off stump. Wide of the keeper and a boundary. Finn has his hands on his head.
INDIA:8.6  Bresnan to Virat Kohli, FOUR!!, poor ball to end the over, on the pads and Virat Kohli put it away with a flourish with an emphatic flick. Shuffled across and clipped it away beautifully
INDIA:8.5 Bresnan to Virat Kohli, no run, that kept a tad low, Virat Kohli pushes off the backfoot to cover
INDIA:8.4  Bresnan to Gambhir, 1 run, flicked wide of mid on and the strike turns over

INDIA:8.1  Bresnan to Gambhir, no run, slower delivery on the stumps, defended to the left of the on-rushing bowler
INDIA:7.6  Finn to Virat Kohli, no run, Jaffa! How do you play those? Virat Kohli did well not to nick that. Pacy back of a length delivery that cut away at the last moment, Virat Kohli was comitted to the defensive shot and the ball flew past his edge. Kies yanks his head back in depair. Supah stuff from Finn. Consistently in the 90+ MPH range. Virat Kohli has a suspicious look at the pitch. Brute!
INDIA:7.5  Finn to Virat Kohli, no run, beaten! Doesn't carry to Kies. Virat Kohli pushing at a ball outside off and the variable bounce ensuring that it dies on the way to the keeper
INDIA:7.4  Finn to Virat Kohli, FOUR!!, falls short of Swann at 2nd slip and bursts through his fingers and runs away to the third man fence. Virat Kohli played it with soft hands and that ensured that it didn't carry. Half stopped by Swann, but the ball slowly trickled into the ropes

INDIA:6.6  Bresnan to Virat Kohli, no run, full and on middle, Virat Kohli gets forward and defendsVirat Kohli, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:6.5  Bresnan to Rahane, out Caught by Dernbach at fine leg!! Gone! The short one has taken out Rahane. This one was on the stumps and not as high as the previous one, Rahane swivelled and pulled well, but found Dernbach running in from fine leg to perfection. Taken with fingers pointing up and Bresnan is roaring in delight. Unnecessary shot has cost Rahane his wicket. England have now removed both the openers. Rahane c Dernbach b Bresnan 14(15) [4s-1 6s-1] Bresnan to Rahane, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:6.4 Bresnan to Rahane, SIX!!, Dropped by the young ball kid beyond the fine leg ropes. Short and outside off, Rahane timed the pull and it evaded a leaping Dernbach at fine leg and went over the ropes. Was timed well and the ball travelled all the way. Neat pick up pull as he took it from outside off and got a maximum for his efforts.
INDIA:6.3  Bresnan to Gambhir, 1 run, exceptional running, another quick single is pinched, Gambhir and Rahane have a good understanding with each other and that shows. Easily done as the ball just about rolls to short cover
INDIA:6.2  Bresnan to Rahane, 1 run, drop and run! Gambhir is quick to respond and Bresnan's footie skills isn't that good. Tries to kick it onto the stumps, but misses. Won't get into the Leeds United football team for sure. Sourav Ganguly on air says that he is from Sheffield United - not so sure about that.
INDIA:6.1  Bresnan to Rahane, FOUR!!, middle stump line and Rahane doesn't need a second invitation. Flicks wonderfully with a subtle closing of the bat face and the ball races away past square leg.Some issues behind the bowler's arm. The reserve umpire is getting it fixed. A slight delay. Looks like it has been fixed and we are ready to go again.
INDIA:5.6  Finn to Gambhir, no run, 91 MPH from Finn, left alone by Gambhir and Kies takes it and then tumbles over. Finn has an elongated follow-through and has a stare at Gambhir.

INDIA:5.4  Finn to Rahane, no run, back of a length delivery on middle stump line, Rahane drops it in front of mid wicket, looks for the quick single, not there
INDIA:5.3  Finn to Gambhir, 1 run, that could've been a risky single only if the fielder wasn't Dernbach. Sadly for England, it was the South African at mid off who was very late in picking it up and Gambhir made it with a dive. Even if Dernbach had hit, Gambhir was well in.
INDIA:5.2  Finn to Gambhir, no run, 150.2 km/h which is 93.3 MPH, real pace from Finn, angled across Gambhir who lets it go. Flies through to Kies
INDIA:5.1  Finn to Rahane, 1 run, nips back in from outside off, Rahane closes the face of the bat and works it down to fine leg
INDIA:4.6  Bresnan to Gambhir, no run, and moves to the pitch of the ball and crouches low to drive to cover, but straight to the fielder again
INDIA:4.5  Bresnan to Gambhir, no run, now leans forward to drive beautifully to mid off, pity he cannot get it past the fielder
INDIA:4.4  Bresnan to Gambhir, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, Gambhir calmly defends to off. He isn't fussed at all by the tactics from the EnglishBresnan looks really desperate for a wicket. Bresnan is carrying a towel behind his back. That slipped out as he was coming in to bowl. Gambhir wasn't ready in any case to play that ball. He was looking down as Bresnan was coming in to release the ball. Gambhir pulls out and Bresnan hits the middle stump. Bresnan appeals and Tarapore immediately signals a dead ball. The England team cannot believe it. But Gambhir pulled out well before Bresnan released the ball. No way can that be out. But England do not agree. But the game restarts with Gambhir ready to face again.
INDIA:4.3  Bresnan to Gambhir, no run, Gambhir is half forward and defends a full ball on middle and off to the off side
INDIA:4.2  Bresnan to Gambhir, no run, a quick short delivery greets Gambhir who does well to sway out of the line of the ball. Gets a stare from Bresnan for good measure tooGautam Gambhir, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:4.1  Bresnan to Parthiv Patel, out Caught by Alastair Cook at mid on!! So that dropped catch has cost England 2 runs. Swann would be mighty relieved. A beautiful face in the crowd cannot believe it and closes her face with her hands in disappointment. Parthiv Patel got forward to clip it over mid wicket, but instead the ball went to mid on, where Cook took an excellent overhead catch with two hands and then tumbled over. England badly needed that wicket. Parthiv Patel c Alastair Cook b Bresnan 12(17) [4s-2] Bresnan to Parthiv Patel, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:3.6  Finn to Rahane, no run, the in-swinger, but Rahane is solid in defence

INDIA:3.3  Finn to Parthiv Patel, no run, full and on the stumps, Parthiv Patel is making a conscious effort to get forward, mistimes the off drive to mid off. The bat turned in his hand as he tried to play that
INDIA:3.2  Finn to Parthiv Patel, no run, pitched outside leg. Finn thought he had his man. But that pitched outside leg and beat Parthiv Patel on the flick. Would've hit the middle stump, but Billy Bowden gets it absolutely right. Finn doesn't agree, but sadly that's what the rule-book says in Cricket.
INDIA:3.1  Finn to Parthiv Patel, no run, tight bowling from Finn, Parthiv Patel defends it to backward point from the crease
INDIA:2.6  Bresnan to Parthiv Patel, 1 run, good fielding from Dernbach at cover, dives to his left and stops it with his left hand, cannot prevent the single though
INDIA:2.5  Bresnan to Parthiv Patel, no run, Dropped by Swann at 2nd slip. England don't need those, when they are chasing such a moderate total. Perfect ball, slanted across Parthiv Patel on a fuller length, squared up Parthiv Patel a tad as he looked to drive through cover, a healthy edge went to the left of Swann, who got both hands to it and shelled it. Was travelling, but you expect Swann to catch those. He is an exceptional slip fielder, but not this time.
INDIA:2.4  Bresnan to Parthiv Patel, no run, short and wide outside off, Parthiv Patel tried to hit that too hard and mistimed the cut into the ground
INDIA:2.3  Bresnan to Parthiv Patel, FOUR!!, well executed. It was a short of length delivery on middle stump, Parthiv Patel went back and turned the wrists on it at the right moment to deflect it wide of mid on, Cook gave chase and tried to pull it back with a slide and a dive, but tumbled over the ropes with the ball
INDIA:2.2  Bresnan to Rahane, leg byes, 1 run, down leg and Rahane got inside the line to flick, missed and it ran off the pad to fine leg. No chance of being LBW, was going down.

INDIA:1.6  Finn to Parthiv Patel, no run, flicked to square leg
INDIA:1.5  Finn to Parthiv Patel, FOUR!!, for a short man, Parthiv Patel plays those punches off the backfoot very nicely. Slanting across him and he gets great meat on the backfoot punch and the ball speeds across the turf, bisecting the backward point and cover fielders. Point gave chase, but the ball was always going to be the winner
INDIA:1.4  Finn to Parthiv Patel, no run, stump to stump line from Finn. Nothing given away, Parthiv Patel defends to leg. Played that softly too.
INDIA:1.3  Finn to Parthiv Patel, no run, 91 MPH! Hurries onto Parthiv Patel, from a back of a length area, he is caught in no-man's land and edges the defensive shot onto the pads. That had Parthiv Patel hopping, too quick for him

INDIA:0.1  Bresnan to Parthiv Patel, no run, good start from Bresnan. Tight back of a length delivery and slanted across Parthiv Patel, who is back and across and defending neatlyParthiv Patel and Rahane are at the crease. Parthiv Patel is on strike. Bresnan will open the attackThe Indian openers walk out to the middle. Tim Bresnan - the stockily built Yorkshireman has the new nut. A couple of slips and a regulation field to begin with. Play! Get set to hear more 'there you see' from Sourav Ganguly. Jeez! Mute the TV please!Welcome to the Indian chase. Should be a cake-walk for the home side, but funnier things have happened in this strange game. What the game needs is a couple of quick wickets and we could be in for a fascinating game. England will come out with the same intention of nipping out a few quick ones at the start.England were rocked by both the Kumars at the start. Pietersen and Trott tried to consolidate, but both got out just as they looked set for a big one. Later, Samit Patel and Bairstow tried to build a partnership but their dismissals in the space of an over meant that England would never reach a good score. Umesh Yadav bowled full and fast in the middle and looked impressive picking up 2 wickets. But the stand out bowler was Vinay Kumar as he picked up 4 important wickets. Overall a disciplined performance from the Indians. They should be able to chase this total down with considerable ease. Join us for the chase in a short while.Vinay Kumar might be the only one who might feel a little disappointed that he didn't pick up the fifth wicket. He totally deserved it. These are his best figures in ODIs.4
ENGLAND:48.2  Umesh Yadav to Dernbach, out Dernbach Run Out!!1 run completed. Good length delivery angled into Dernbach who somehow pushes it to Raina at cover.

India wouldn't mind it either, as the dry ball will help their spinners. A good crowd in for today's game, as you would expect for most ODI games in India. Play!Teams:India (Playing XI): Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Vinay Kumar, Umesh YadavEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Craig Kieswetter(w), Kevin Pietersen, Jonathan Trott, Ravi Bopara, Jonathan Bairstow, Samit Patel, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, Steven Finn, Jade DernbachDhoni: We would have bowled first as there will be some dew. With Jadeja around, it gives us a good balance. The dew doesn't affect our team selection as we have a 3-2 combination. It is not about what we have done in the past. It is a fresh start, a new venue and a new game. No changes in the team.Cook: The wicket may be a bit low and inconsistent. We were outplayed in the last match but we have a chance to come back. It is a small ground so not sure about a good total. England remain unchanged.England have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: The wicket has been relaid and there are a few cracks. There is a little bit of grass and a hint of moisture. Dew may be a factor later on, but the team winning the toss will want to bat first.Hello and welcome to the coverage of the second game of the 5 match series between India and England. India started the 'revenge' on a right note with a big win in the Hyderabad ODI and would look to assert their dominance on home conditions. Cook, on the other hand, will be keen to prove that this England side is much different from the earlier teams that struggled in the sub continent. A good battle awaits us. Stay tuned for all the updates..Preview by SrivathsaIt was touted as the revenge series or as the official broadcasters' tag-line suggested - the 'Payback Series', before the 5 match ODI series started. India have taken the first step towards making the tag-line come true by thumping the visitors in an one-sided game at Hyderabad. One win though doesn't make a summer and MSD and Co. will surely be aware of the fact. But the manner in which the Indian team beat the English, it sure has raised a lot of doubts about the ability of the opposition to play quality spin.India: India at home are a different side altogether and that's what we saw at Hyderabad. The wicket was on the slower side to begin with and the batsmen at the top bided their time, before MS Dhoni and Raina accelerated superbly. MS Dhoni is one of the best batsmen in ODIs and he proved it again with an innings that started off slowly, but reached top gear towards the end. His power hitting ensured that India had sufficient runs in the bank, when at one stage it looked like they would struggle to reach a total beyond 260. Once the runs were up on the board, it was left to the spinners to weave their magic and they performed as expected to subject England to their 2nd heaviest defeat against India.India's batting may not have the likes of Tendulkar, Sehwag and Yuvraj, but it still looks a formidable one especially in home conditions. If the openers fire, then scores of well over 300 could be expected in the remaining games. Even the bowling which was found wanting so badly in England, came to the party with the all the three seamers producing a consistent performance. It was heartening to see Umesh Yadav hit speeds of above 140 km/h on a regular basis and the two wickets he scalped would've surely boosted his confidence no end.The re-emergence of Ravindra Jadeja as an all-rounder of substance has been the single biggest gain for India from the 1st ODI. Not only does he look an improved player, but his confidence with the bat is filtering into his bowling and fielding as well. If Jadeja can replicate his Hyderabad performance time and again, then India's wish for that elusive all-rounder at No. 7 would be fulfilled. Praveen Kumar was fantastic with the new ball and his spell with Vinay Kumar where they frustrated Pietersen by denying him the boundaries, ultimately created the run-out opportunity for Ashwin. India look hungry for revenge and look a better side than England in home conditions.England: The enormity of the loss might just be sinking in for the English, but it was the tame manner in which they capitulated that should worry them more. It wasn't exceptional spin bowling or a rank bad pitch that caused the down-fall, but some poor strokes under pressure that created it. Trott, Bopara and Bairstow all fell to soft dismissals and from then on, it was just a matter of time before the game was sewn up by India. At one stage England were 111/2 with Cook anchoring the innings well, before his dismissal opened the flood-gates. The inability of the middle and the lower order to offer any sort of resistance is a worrying sign for Flower, especially with the remaining games expected to produce pitches on the slower side.Ian Bell, who has been one of their best batsmen in recent times, was surprisingly omitted in favor of a red-hot Bairstow, who flopped. Bell is perhaps England's best player of spin as well and the team management must have surely realised their folly after the first ODI in dropping him. Calls for his comeback into the side, would have surely grown and it wouldn't be a bad idea to bring him back to beef up the middle order. Kieswetter is another worry for the English for he doesn't look like he can get away with his attacking game on pitches like the one that will be produced here. He needs to play himself in before trying anything fancy. The English spinners were very good, with Swann being outstanding and did well in containing the Indians till the 35th over until the batting power-play started the deluge of runs. The bowling at the death apart from Bresnan was found wanting with both Finn and Dernbach unable to bowl the yorkers on demand. If England are to compete in the series, then they have to restrict India to totals which they can hope to chase down.Final word: After finally winning a game against England in any format since December 2008, India look a transformed side and would be hard to beat in home conditions, if the pitches help them. Expect India to go 2-0 up with another commanding performance.Teams:India (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Virat Kohli, Rahul Sharma, Varun Aaron, Sreenath Aravind, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Gautam Gambhir, Praveen Kumar, Ajinkya Rahane, Parthiv Patel, Suresh Raina, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay Kumar, Umesh YadavEngland (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jonathan Bairstow, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Scott Borthwick, Tim Bresnan, Jos Buttler, Jade Dernbach, Steven Finn, Alex Hales, Craig Kieswetter(w), Stuart Meaker, Samit Patel, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Jonathan Trott, Chris WoakesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
