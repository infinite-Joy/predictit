SOUTH AFRICA:43.2 43.2 Woodcock to Morne Morkel, out Caught by (sub)How!! SA are eliminated. What a sad way to end though. Yet another World Cup and they stick to their reputation - this one is the mother of all chokes. Morne Morkel comes down the track and had no other option but to go for the big hit.

It's an even game at the moment. Both sides have not given an inch to each other so far. After Smith's wicket, the Kiwis have tightened things further. South Africa's best batters are at the crease and they need to put a substantial partnership from them to take their side home. To tell you more it will be our in-house stats man - Pradeep - who does a lot of work, but does not get the credit he deserves, who will tell you more. Time for me (Srivathsa) to take a break.

SOUTH AFRICA:0.6  N McCullum to Amla, out Caught by Vettori!! Bizzaro! One of the most lucky wickets to get as a bowler, and Amla will feel what crime he has committed to get out like that. It was short, wide outside off, kept a bit low, Amla bottom edged the cut, it hit Baz's right boot, and went to slip, normally it would go down into the ground, this time straight to the boot and then to Dan at slip. Amla was walking off. He knew that he was gone. The third ump confirmed that. What a freaky wicket for NZ. Amla c Vettori b N McCullum 7(5) [4s-1] N McCullum to Amla, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Drama: Amla looks to be gone. The Kiwis are confident as they go up for a catch at slip. N McCullum and his brother are jumping up and down.

SOUTH AFRICA:0.3  N McCullum to Amla, FOUR!!, wonderful shot, that is, the Amla square drive, leaning out and caressing it into the gap, the ball purred across the turf, if there is even a slight amount of width given to Amla, he will make you pay, good start from SA
SOUTH AFRICA:0.2  N McCullum to Amla, 2 runs, full and angled across Amla who gets forward and drives it wide of cover for a couple of runs, is off the mark
SOUTH AFRICA:0.1  N McCullum to Amla, no run, flat delivery from round the wicket and Amla punches it off the backfoot to the off sideAmla and Smith are at the crease. Amla is on strike. N McCullum will open the attackThe Kiwis have put up a score on the board and in a pressure game, that's a vital thing. Though, the score is not a big one, it will take some getting from this talented South African batting line-up to get there. Remember that both sides have not won a knock-out game in the World Cups. Nathan McCullum will open the bowling. Amla is on strike. Smith is at the non-strikers end. A slip in place for the elder McCullum.Taylor: It skidded on quite nicely, we got 220 on the board, hope that is enough. We have got the runs on the board, hopefully we can contain them. If we can get a couple of early wickets and put them under pressure, then it might be enough. We might open with a spinner as South Africa did today.In spite of losing the toss, Smith would be a happy man looking at how things have gone for him and his bowlers today. His captaincy was right up to the mark, he was innovative and he also kept the right men in the right areas. Peterson opened the bowling again and removed the dangerous McCullum, and Guptill didn't last any longer. The big man - Jesse Ryder - entertained the crowd with his scintillating backfoot punchy drives through the off side. Ross Taylor gave him good company but threw his wicket away trying to step the pedal on the accelerator. Once Ryder left, there was not much spice in the batting order to lift the scoring. Tahir impressed again with his variations in the middle overs. A moderate total of 221 is what the Kiwis have achieved in the end. Will the South Africans chase it down easily? Remember, they are known to choke under pressure. Do join us for the remainder of the game at 6:15 PM IST.4

NEW ZEALAND:5.5  Steyn to Guptill, no run, wonderful shot, equally good fielding! It was a poor ball from Steyn, short and a bit of width on offer, it was punched hard off the backfoot, brutally hit, du Plessis at short cover times his jump perfectly, flies to his left with arms stretched upwards and stops it, that would have made Jonty Rhodes proud!

It is a repeat of how Bell got out to Peterson earlier this tournament, nicely tossed up, invited Brendon McCullum to come down the wicket, but the dance down the wicket forced McCullum to check his shot as he got too close to the pitch of the ball, ends up chipping it to the left of the bowler, not too close to him though, but a flying catch to his left marks the end of McCullum. The ball was going away from Peterson and he just threw himself in the air and went at it with both hands, splendid effort that. Brendon McCullum c and b Peterson 4(4) Peterson to Brendon McCullum, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!

NEW ZEALAND:0.1  Peterson to Guptill, no run, slower through the air, drifting in to middle and leg, Guptill gets his front leg out of the way and defends it with the full faceGuptill and Brendon McCullum are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Peterson will open the attackAlright, this is Ajith and I will be with you for the first 15 overs. As expected, Smith starts with a spinner. Robin Peterson is the man, he has done this a couple of times before.Time for the Anthems: Melodious anthems play in the background and the players recite the same with pride. The Proteas' Anthem precedes that of the Kiwis. The Black Caps have their arms around each other's shoulders as they sing their anthem. Batting first was probably the best chance for the Kiwis, will they make the most of it? Ryder hasn't fired, McCullum hasn't played a match winning innings apart from the century against Canada. Time for them to step up and make it count. Some of the South Africans are in a huddle, a mini huddle rather. McCullum has walked out ahead of his partner, his body language suggests that he is raring to go.Botha, Tahir, Peterson, Duminy and du Plessis - lots of men who can turn the ball for South Africa; New Zealand also have Vettori, Nathan McCullum and Woodcock. The conditions are slightly overcast and it would be interesting to see whether Smith starts off with spin from one end.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Graeme Smith(c), Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Johan Botha, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(w), Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Kane Williamson, Nathan McCullum, Jacob Oram, Daniel Vettori(c), Luke Woodcock, Tim SoutheeSmith: Steyn, Morkel and de Villiers are back in the side. Tsotsobe misses out. AB is keeping wickets, van Wyk misses out of today's game. He has recovered from the niggle, he will be fresh. We have been looking forward to today's game. We have just kept ourselves and are focussing on the tournament.Vettori: The wicket looks good, we would want to bat first. The wicket will be similar to what we saw in the Pakistan West Indies game. I'm fit but not 100% yet, I need to hide myself in the field. South Africa have been favorites against us before, and we have finished better than them on certain occasions.New Zealand have won the toss and elected to batde Villiers: Enjoyed the couple of centuries up front, would love to get into the park and play well. I have worked hard with the physio and the training staff. A break can work in your favor, while it may also work against you. I hope it will help me come back strong and fresh. I still believe India are the favorites, we are playing well, we need to do the basics well and win big moments. Everybody is fit and raring to go today.Pitch report: There are a few cracks, but the grass covering is quite prominent. The wicket will be skiddy, the wicket will hold good for the entire game. Again, the captain who wins the toss may want to bat first feels Danny Morrison.Weather report: It rained cats and dogs for 3 hours last night, and there is a bit of rain expected today as well. Max temp: 34 degHello folks, I've still not come out of the hangover of yesterday's thriller between India and Australia. But, today's game promises to be equally good; South Africa are the favorites going into this game while New Zealand, on the other hand, are the dark horses who have always done well in the ICC events. Don't write them out yet, they do have some of the best power hitters in their line up. This is Ajith and I will bring you all the action as and when it unfolds. I will also be joined by Sid V, Pradeep and Srivathsa. Don't go away, more updates are coming your way.The preview by Gokul GopalSouth Africa and New Zealand would be looking to quickly hop on to an aeroplane, particularly the one that leads to Colombo, while both sides would be fighting it out to avoid the flight back home. South Africa have definitely been one of the best teams in this World Cup and also the favourites to clinch the title, but with New Zealand too playing competitive cricket, it has to be seen if the Proteas do progress to the semi-final or, as they have done so many times in the previous World Cups, choke out.Head to Head: New Zealand and South Africa have faced each other on 5 occasions in the World Cups. The Kiwis have won 3 games while ending up on the losing side two times. What would give the Black-Caps more confidence is that they have won the last two World Cup matches against the Proteas (2003 and 2007).Build up to the game:South Africa: Apart from the loss to England in the group stage, the Proteas, by far, have been one of the better sides in this tournament with their entire team having been amongst runs or wickets. AB de Villiers has been their main run accumulator, having scored 318 runs at an average of 106 including 2 hundreds and a fifty. South Africa's Mr. Consistent - Hashim Amla has once again lived up to his tag and is the second highest run -scorer for the Proteas with 299 runs including a hundred and two fifties. The middle order has been South Africa's main strength as the likes of JP Duminy and Faf du Plessis have been making optimum use of the good starts provided by the batters at the top and proceeded to convert those starts to good totals. While chasing too, the middle order has ensured that they led the team to the end. The only concern with the batting is that Graeme Smith has failed to convert good starts into big scores while the team is yet to shed their tendency to choke, as shown in the game against England.
South African bowling has definitely been several notches higher than the other teams in the tournament. They are the only team to bowl out all six opponents in the first round and the bowlers have the lowest average runs per wicket at 17.1 as well as the best strike rate of 23.8 balls per wicket. The South African attack has all the variety with Steyn and Morkel leading from the pace front while the likes of Imran Tahir, Robin Peterson and Johan Botha handling the spin department well. Peterson and Tahir have been the stand-out performers with the ball for the Proteas. The former has taken 14 wickets from 6 games at an average of 13.50 while the latter has 12 wickets from 4 matches at an average of 9.83. Steyn too has been in his elements and his 5-wicket haul against India proved that he is a key member in the South African attack despite the spin-friendly sub-continent tracks.New Zealand: Like always, the Kiwis started the tournament as dark horses and steadily progressed into the last 8 by beating the minnows easily and also halting Pakistan's winning run in their group match. However, their losses against the top teams, especially against Sri Lanka in the last game, got the alarm bells ringing. It was Ross Taylor's blitzkreig that won the game for the Kiwis against Pakistan, but that apart, New Zealand's performance in this World Cup can be termed only as average. The top order has failed for New Zealand many a times and despite Brendon McCullum scoring a century against Canada, he has been found wanting against the top teams. Martin Guptill and Jesse Ryder too haven't been doing enough to lend solidity to the batting department. Apart from Ross Taylor, the rest of the batters are still in search of a good knock out in the middle and they will have to come to the party going up against the might of the Proteas.
Tim Southee has been the spearhead in the New Zealand bowling department, having taken 14 wickets in 6 matches at an average of 15.07. Injuries to key players has been the main problem for the Kiwis. Hamish Bennett was ruled out of the World Cup after an injury to his ankle and Achilles tendon. Kyle Mills, who picked up a quad strain in the game against Canada, has only played in 3 matches so far while Daniel Vettori hurt his knee while attempting a catch in the game against Pakistan and did not feature in 2 matches for New Zealand. However, going into the quarter-finals, New Zealand's bowling would sport a confident look as Kyle Mills and Daniel Vettori are likely to play while also included in the line-up is Daryl Tuffey, who is the replacement for Bennett. Mills, Tuffey and Vettori along with Nathan McCullum have a tough task on hand if they are to restrict the powerful South African batting.Quotes:We are used to the conditions, which has got to help us. To play South Africa in those conditions is not a bad draw at all. They obviously prefer a little more pace and bounce in their wickets. Dhaka won't quite give them that and I'm sure they'll be a little disappointed: Brendon McCullum feels that the conditions in Bangladesh would be more suited to the Kiwis.
We know we are up against a quality team and if we are not going to be on top of our game, it's going to be a really tough match. Ross Taylor is definitely a key player and so is Brendon McCullum. And Daniel Vettori is obviously a world class bowler.
