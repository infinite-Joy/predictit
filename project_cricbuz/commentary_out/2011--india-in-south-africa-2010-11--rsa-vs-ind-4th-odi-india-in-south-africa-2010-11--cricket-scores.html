When they were down in the dumps at 118/5, he has rescued them and helped them to 265. Amla looked in fine touch, but a mini collapse when they lost 4 wickets for 12 runs made them wobble. Botha and Duminy put on a responsible stand of 70 and it looks a competitive score. The pitch looks a bit up and down and India would have to bat really well to win the series here. Kohli has been sensational in the field today as he has been right through all series, can India finish off the series here? or will SA level it? Do stay tuned to find out, we will be back shortly for the chase...4

SOUTH AFRICA:0.3  Zaheer to Amla, no run, peach of a delivery from Zak, length delivery, delivered from wide of the crease, angles in and straightens just outside off, Amla plays for the swing and gets beaten
SOUTH AFRICA:0.2  Zaheer to Smith, 1 run, back of a length, gets a bit of extra bounce, Smith looks to defend, the ball takes the outside edge, rolls to short third man
SOUTH AFRICA:0.1  Zaheer to Amla, 1 run, starts from round the wicket, angles a fuller length delivery, shapes into Amla, he nudges it to mid wicket, sets off for a single to immediately get off the markAmla and Smith are at the crease. Amla is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackKohli: The confidence is quite high after winning two close games. My feet are moving well after the Johannesburg game and I want to enjoy my batting on this tour. Credit must be given to the support staff for improving the fielding of this team. I really enjoy fielding at the slips to the spinners, but I have no problem fielding anywhere. The pitches this time in SA are assisting the bowlers as well and it is a great learning experience.Botha: We are still positive but we are disappointed that we lost two close games. We would love to square the series and go into the decider at Centurion. The guys were a bit nervous before the announcement of the WC squad, but hopefully they can relax now. A score of 280 is a good score and there have been some high run chases in the past at this venue. Hopefully, if we are chasing, we can chase down a good score. The grass covering is a bit dry and it will assist the spinners. I have bowled pretty well, but I would like to pick up a few wickets.Teams:India (Playing XI): Parthiv Patel, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Munaf PatelSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Graeme Smith(c), Morne van Wyk, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Robin Peterson, Johan Botha, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo TsotsobeDhoni: It looks a slow track. It is important to be in a confident state of mind and we are in a good state of mind. Parthiv Patel replaces Murali Vijay in the team. 'We will probably share the keeping duties' (when asked by Ravi Shastri as to who will keep).Graeme Smith: The wicket will be slower and slower as the game progresses. The pitch will remain the same for the entire duration of the day. The guys can relax a bit with the World Cup squad being announced. We have two changes. Robin Petersen comes in for Wayne Parnell and van Wyk comes in place of Ingram.South Africa have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: Out of the 32 ODI games played in Port Elizabeth since 1992, SA have won 16 times. Out of the 13 day-night games played here, one was abandoned and in the remaining 12, teams have won six times. There is a strong wind blowing across the ground and that will not assist the swing bowlers. The lights in this venue are not all that good. The team that wins the toss will want to bat first. It is an easy paced wicket and a score of 240 is a good score on this wicket. The pitch has a good covering of grass. It has been cut low and it is dry. The pitch will assist the spinners as the game progresses. The bowlers will have to bowl straight on this wicket.Parthiv Patel: I did not have enough time to get into the groove. It would have been better if I had come earlier, but I am getting used to it. The confidence of the Indian team is high after strong performances in the Tests and the ODIs. I have had only one net session before the match, but I have played in the IPL here before and I am confident that I can do well. Both the teams are playing real well, but the Indian team is holding their nerve in a close encounter.After two nail-biters at Johannesburg and Cape Town, the focus now shifts to the all important fourth ODI at Port Elizabeth. India will be looking to clinch their first ever ODI series win in the Rainbow nation while South Africa will be looking to come back into the series and take it to the decider at Centurion. This is Sid V, and I will bring you all the action with Karthik and Srivathsa. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates..Preview:India is on the verge of creating history, with a first-ever ODI series triumph on South African soil beckoning ahead of the fourth ODI.
The Indians have never won a limited-overs series in South Africa and Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men will leave no stone unturned to achieve the feat at St George's Park.
Even though India are leading the series 2-1, there are several things the visitors will want to improve on, with the main one being batting. The batting was ordinary in the first two matches, while it was just a little bit better in the third match. The bowling and fielding were responsible for both wins.
With seniors like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir missing from the ranks, the youngsters, who have done well in the recent past, have not been able to cope with the conditions.
India's bowling attack, in contrast, has been impressive with the pace duo of Zaheer Khan and Munaf Patel creating problems for the batsmen. Even spin spearhead Harbhajan Singh has come up with consistent performances with the ball, while with the bat, he scored valuable runs in the third ODI.
If India have been bad with the bat though, South Africa have been even worse. The first ODI saw them put up a good total, but since then, the batsmen have let the side down rather badly. In the absence of veteran all-rounder Jacques Kallis, South Africa lack the required balance in the side and even as captain Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy and new comer Faf du Plessis have all chipped in with runs, they simply have not made up for the loss of Kallis so far in the tournament.
South Africa's chief problem while batting appears to be a rather long tail. Given that, the pressure on the top order to fire is even higher than normal and the lack of all-rounders in the side has upset the balance considerably.
The bowling has been fairly adequate, though the bowlers would do well to have more specific plans for someone like Yusuf Pathan - who can change the game in a matter of minutes.
The home side's fielding was far below its world-class standards in the third ODI, and the fact that the fielding fell apart was perhaps the sign of a side not being all mentally 'there' in the match.
If South Africa want to prevent a series-win for India, they will need to be a lot more switched on for this match. Having won two close matches - in both of which South Africa had their chances to win - the Indians will be feeling much better mentally than the South Africans. South Africa need to overcome that deficit as well as batting woes, while India need to continue to be mentally strong and not take undue pressure from the fact that this could be a first-ever series win in South Africa.
