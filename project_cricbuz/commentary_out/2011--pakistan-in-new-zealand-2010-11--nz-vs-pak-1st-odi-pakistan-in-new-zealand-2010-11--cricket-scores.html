PAKISTAN:1.2  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, pitched up outside the off stump, in the channel, Kamran Akmal comes on the frontfoot and offers the full face
PAKISTAN:1.1  Southee to Kamran Akmal, no run, fuller and swinging away, driven straight to the fielder at point
PAKISTAN:1.1  Southee to Kamran Akmal, wide, too wide outside off, shaping away further, Kamran Akmal was reaching out for it with no feet movement, dreadful cricket all around, Kamran Akmal was swinging miles away from the ballTim Southee, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:0.6  Franklin to Hafeez, no run, Oh! Did that come off the inside edge? We need replays to confirm, the ball came back in sharply, Hafeez was pushing forward to defend, the ball rushed between the bat and the pad, there was some appreciable deviation, it may have flipped the top of the pad, the bowler was interested but the ball falls just short of the keeper
PAKISTAN:0.5  Franklin to Hafeez, no run, pitched outside leg again, Hafeez misses out on the leg glance, rolls in front of his legs off his front padSome movement in front of the sight-screen and there is a delay in play.
PAKISTAN:0.4  Franklin to Hafeez, no run, that one came back in off the deck, raps Hafeez on his front pad in front of the leg stump, it was sliding down, no appeal whatsoever from the Kiwis, looked like it also pitched outside leg
PAKISTAN:0.3  Franklin to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, goes for the similar shot, it was not as full as the previous delivery, drives it wide of Nathan at cover point, he dives to his left and keeps it down to one, he's a livewire in the field
PAKISTAN:0.2  Franklin to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, wonderful way to get off the mark! There was width on offer, it was the sucker ball, Kamran Akmal square drives it to perfection, gets it past point and there was no stopping that
PAKISTAN:0.1  Franklin to Kamran Akmal, no run, nice and straight, starts from over the wicket and bowls a short of a good length delivery, Kamran Akmal gets behind the line and defends it to the off sideKamran Akmal and Hafeez are at the crease.

The groundsmen have had 16 days for preparing this wicket, it is a good looking pitch. 240 has been the par score on this wicket and Pakistan would need more than that to feel comfortable. The outfield is lush green.Vettori: We would have liked to bat as well, but the wicket would remain the same for the entire day. There are a few changes to the side, we need to get the right combination right before the WC.
