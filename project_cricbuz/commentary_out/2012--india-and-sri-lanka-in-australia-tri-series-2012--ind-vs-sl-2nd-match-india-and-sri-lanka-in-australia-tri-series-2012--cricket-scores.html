SRI LANKA:3.6  Vinay Kumar to Dilshan, no run, a terrific over from Vinay Kumar. A maiden. Another leave from Dilshan as the ball thuds into Mahendra Singh Dhoni's gloves. This is a vastly different Vinay Kumar, to the one that we saw here in the test match

SRI LANKA:2.3  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, peach! Zaheer goes wide of the crease and angles it in before it holds its line. Tharanga was playing for the inswinger and was lucky that he didn't nick it. It just about shaped past the edge

Tharanga is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackSangakkara:  We have just come from SA and we have had good preparations. Playing in SA is a sort of ideal preparations. Our training and practise sessions have gone really well. We will need to execute our plans well, the end result will be the key. The WACA is a great wicket, it has good carry and bounce. We have good memories out here. We need to play as a team and the results will follow.Teams:India (Playing XI): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Vinay Kumar, Praveen Kumar, Zaheer KhanSri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Thissara Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Dhammika PrasadDhoni:  We have made two changes. Gautam has been rested and Rahul Sharma has an injury. Zaheer and Sehwag are back in the squad. We are looking forward to the contest. We are confident about our chances.Mahela: We will bat first. The pitch looks good and we will look to set a total. We are playing four quicks and seven batsmen. We had a good finish against South Africa and we will look to carry forward the momentum. Captaincy is a new challenge for me and I am looking to do well.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: Ravi Shastri feels that it is a Day 3 pitch, but it still is really hard. There are some patches of grass. There will be a lot of bounce on offer for the bowlers. Ian Chappell reckons that the batsmen can trust the bounce. The players who play the horizontal bat shots can do well here. The team that wins the toss should bat first. It has been 10 months since the two teams were on a high. Since then it has been all downhill for both teams. India have struggled away from home comforts while Sri Lanka have been plagued by controversies both on and off the field. Both teams will look to forget the past as they embark on a new journey. Hello and a warm welcome to one and all for the 2nd match of the Commonwealth Bank series. India are up against Sri Lanka at the WACA, Perth. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates..Preview by Vishaal LoganathanThe last time these 2 met, was at a grand occasion - the finals of the World Cup. The occasion might not be that grand when India and Sri Lanka face off in the 2nd match of the CB series but a win will be almost as important as both team have come in for some severe criticism for the form they have been in lately.The ODI leg of the tour to Australia gives both teams an opportunity to put things back on track after some calamitous results lately. The start to the series however wasn't on expected lines for India with the hosts trumping them in the rain curtailed encounter. Two losses in a row will make things extremely difficult for MS Dhoni's men. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will be looking to answer many questions after having made sweeping changes in order to improve their performances. They will want to kick things off with a win and make their newly instilled skipper Mahela Jayawardene's job a tad easier.India:These are tough times for India - everyone is expecting changes to take place once the team returns from Down Under while questions remain about the players' ability to play abroad. The criticism has been severe and the team will be hoping to silence the critics with a win.India's batting failure has become a familiar story - with the famed top order failing miserably and leaving the middle and lower order under immense pressure to hit form every time.The opening pair remains a concern with both Sachin Tendulkar and Gautam Gambhir failing to score more than 5 in the first ODI. Virat Kohli has been India's best bet with the bat during this tour, but the talented right hand bat will be disappointed at not making the most of his starts. He will facing familiar faces when India take on Sri Lanka (having played against the Lankans in 20 ODIs) and will look to ensure he gives India a solid platform up front.Rohit Sharma and Suresh Raina's show in the first ODI offers little solace to the Indian fan, but the duo have class and will hope that will help them get through the struggles. Skipper MS Dhoni too is woefully out of form and will be hoping the top order fires and lets him play his natural game.There's not much good news on the bowling front as well for India as they struggled to contain the Australian middle order after they had broken through early on. Vinay Kumar was exceptional in the opener, picking up 3 wickets whilst not giving away too many runs. His opening bowling partner Praveen Kumar too had a decent outing but could not get among the wickets. The spinners however had to endure a battering at the hands of Matthew Wade and the Hussey brothers giving away 158 runs off just 18 overs. Ravindra Jadeja was the costliest of the lot allowing the batsmen to score in excess of 15 runs an over.The Indian bowlers, spinners especially, will have to cut down drastically on their generosity if they are to entertain thoughts of restricting a strong Sri Lankan batting line up.Team News: India's dashing opener Virender Sehwag hinted that he might take either Sachin or Gambhir's place against the Lankans. India could also play one of Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan or Umesh Yadav as the third seamer in place of one of the specialist spinners.Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka went through wholesale changes prior to this tour - they have a new coach and a new captain - and would be fervently hoping that the changes made would help them become a more potent force. The Islanders have struggled for form since the World Cup, displaying top-notch efforts from time to time but not being consistent enough to vie for top honours. The beaten World Cup finalists will not only be keen to avenge their loss the last time they met at the Wankhede Stadium but also give their fans something to cheer about as they have had to endure a torrid time since then.Tillakaratne Dilshan will be raring to have a go after being relived of his captaincy duties and his carefree batting could be a shot in the arm for the 1996 WC winners. The 35 year old already has 3 hundreds against India and will know that an early attack will setback the beleaguered Indian team. Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara have not enjoyed the best of form, though the stylish left hander hit a hundred in the last game against South Africa, and will be hopeful of getting into stride early. Dinesh Chandimal impressed many with his timed attack in South Africa and he and Thisara Perera will play a key role in upping the ante when required.Lasith Malinga once again will lead the bowling attack, which can prove quite a handful with the likes of Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Chanaka Welegedhara and Dhammika Prasad.Team News: Angelo Mathews has struggled for form of late, but he might still make the cut for the first ODI.
