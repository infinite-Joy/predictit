Amir Hamza will open the attackThe Afghanistani team form a huddle. Coach Inzamam-ul-Haq talks to his players before they make their way out to the middle.Cremer leads Zimbabwe off the field. 131 is not the score Afghanistan wanted after winning the toss and opting to bat. In fact, they started very well, but all of a sudden lost their way completely. Cremer led from the front with the ball as he bagged his second fifer in ODIs. The other two spinners, Raza and Wellington Masakadza too supported him very well. But for Noor Ali Zadran's 63, things would have been a lot worse for Afghanistan. Zimbabwe will resume their innings very shortly...3
