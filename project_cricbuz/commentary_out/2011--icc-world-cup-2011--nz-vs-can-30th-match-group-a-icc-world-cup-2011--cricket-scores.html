I am happy with my form and will like to carry it as the tournament goes by.Bagai: It's a decent pitch and it will offer something for the seamers initialy. It's a new start and it is important to bowl well, this is our first game in Mumbai and hopefully we'll do well.Canada have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report: It is a brand new stadium and it is a brand new pitch. The pitch is hard and there is a good covering of fresh grass. This grass has been rolled in and the bowlers will get a lot of assistance. The team that wins the toss will want to use the freshness of the pitch and bowl first.Hello and Welcome to the match between NZ and Canada at Mumbai. Canada have been impressive in this tournament so far, but results have not gone their way. They will be looking to surprise the Kiwis, but they will know that NZ are high on confidence following their thumping win against Pakistan. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates....The preview by Gokul GopalNew Zealand will be all set to seal their place in the quarter-finals as they take on minnows Canada but they would be without their skipper Daniel Vettori, who injured his knee against Pakistan, and might require a couple of weeks time to get fully fit.Head to head:New Zealand have faced Canada only twice and both those occasions came during a World Cup. In the 2003 edition, New Zealand posted a mammoth 363 on board and bowled out the Canadians for 249. In 2007, Canada could only manage 196 which was chased down comfortably by the Kiwis.Team News:New Zealand: With a total of 6 points from their four matches, the Kiwis are one win away from getting into the knock-out stage. The Black-Caps thumped Zimbabwe and Kenya by 10 wickets and upset Pakistan's momentum by scoring a 110-run win against them. Their only blemish so far has been the loss to Australia. Ross Taylor will lead the side during Vettori's absence and he will be going into the match full of confidence after smashing 131 off 124 balls against Pakistan is his previous game. New Zealand hit an astonishing 100 runs from their final five overs with Nathan McCullum and Jacob Oram also joining in the batting blitz. They would be looking to play with the same intensity and ensure that complacency does not creep in. As far as the team composition is concerned, New Zealand are likely to include left-arm spinner Luke Woodcock in place of the injured skipper.Canada: The North American side do not have a realistic chance of getting into the next round but they will be a confident outfit after registering their first win of the tournament by defeating the Kenyans. Aside that win, Canada have had a tough World Cup, crashing to overwhelming defeats against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe before putting up a resilient performance against Pakistan although ending up on the losing side. Osinde was the pick of the Canadian bowlers during the match against Zimbabwe while the leg-spinner Balaji Rao has been delivering consistent performances throughout the World Cup. It is the batting that has been Canada's main concern and they would be hoping for the top-order to put up a better show.Ground Conditions and Pitch:The refurbished Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, the venue for the final on April 2, will have its first taste of World Cup action when New Zealand take on Kenya. While the weather conditions would only get a lot warmer as the day goes on, the pitch, although a virgin track, is expected to assist the batters.Quotes:The crucial thing is I should be able to continue on with the tournament. I suppose now for me it's about symptoms and the sooner those symptoms dissipate the quicker I can get back on the field which is what everyone wants: Daniel Vettori, hoping to get back to action soon.
We are looking to use this as a spark for the second half of the first round. My goal now is to get the batsmen who are performing to be consistent and leave the first round on a high: Ashish Bagai, mentioning that the win against Kenya would spur his team to perform well.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(w), Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, James Franklin, Scott Styris, Nathan McCullum, Jacob Oram, Daniel Vettori(c), Kyle Mills, Tim Southee, Hamish Bennett, Jamie How, Kane Williamson, Luke WoodcockCanada (From): Ruvindu Gunasekera, Rizwan Cheema, Zubin Surkari, Ashish Bagai(w/c), Jimmy Hansra, Tyson Gordon, John Davison, Harvir Baidwan, Parth Desai, Henry Osinde, Balaji Rao, Nitish Kumar, Khurram Chohan, Hiral Patel, Karl Whatham, Hamza TariqLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
