West Indies will hope for Gayle to come good in this matchAn excellent batting performance from Bangladesh has helped them post their highest total against West Indies. They got to a poor start, but Rahim and Anamul were involved in a record 3rd wicket stand, which turned the tables on Bangladesh. Anamul got to his maiden ton and Mortaza finished the innings with some big shots. Rampaul took a 5-wicket haul, but that was not enough for West Indies to restrict them. Difficult task ahead for WI and Gayle has to fire. Do join us in about 30 minutes......4

The hosts got off to a winning start in the first ODI. West Indies however are not to be written off. They have a number of batsmen who have the skills to win a match single-handedly. It'll be interesting to see if they do make some changes from the previous game. The toss and team updates coming up shortly. Stay tuned.Preview by Gokul GopalWest Indies will be seeking revenge for the sound thrashing they received at the hands of Bangladesh in the first ODI when they face the hosts in the second game of the five match series. Meanwhile, the home team, who came up with a fine all-round performance at the Sheikh Abu Naser Stadium in Khulna in the opening game, will look to produce a similar effort in the second match at the same venue.What happened in the first ODI:The hosts were brilliant in the first match, outsmarting the Caribbean team in all aspects of the game. Sohag Gazi, who played his debut ODI following a fine display in his maiden Test series, came up with a splendid bowling show, picking up four wickets for 29 runs to bowl out the opposition for just 199. Abdur Razzak also impressed in the game, finishing with fine figures of 3/39. Bangladesh then chased down the target comfortably thanks to half-centuries from Tamim Iqbal and Naeem Islam. Anamul Haque and Nasir Hossain also came up with good contributions with the bat as Bangladesh sailed to victory with 7 wickets and 9.4 overs to spare.The West Indian openers Chris Gayle and Lendl Simmons had made a steady start but the visitors were unable to capitalize on that as they lost a flurry of wickets and were left reeling at 133/8. It required some resistance on the part of Sunil Narine and Ravi Rampaul to give themselves and the other bowlers at least a modest total to defend. But getting to 200 seemed like a walk in the park for the hosts as the Windies bowlers were not able to make much of an impact. Although they did pick up three wickets, the hosts were always in control of the game and paced the chase well to prevail in the end. What the teams will be looking to do:Going into the second ODI, the hosts need to produce a clinical show like they did in the first game if they are to replicate that success. Bangladesh also need to be wary of the fact that West Indies will be looking to come back at them hard. Bangladesh do have some concerns ahead of the second match. The seamers were hardly effective in the first match and were taken for a few runs. While skipper Mushfiqur Rahim would be happy that the spinners have been doing well, he'll be expecting the quick bowlers to give them some support. The Bangladesh captain will also be hoping that his bowlers can maintain a disciplined line as West Indies, despite their capitulation in the opening game, have a powerful batting line-up. Bangladesh batters, who stuck to their task in the 7 wicket win, will also need to come up with a similar effort if the hosts are to go 2-0 up.West Indies have only themselves to blame for the poor showing in the 1st ODI. Although the Bangladesh spinners bowled well, the Windies batsmen did not show any inclination to see them off and their lack of application led to the team's downfall. Darren Sammy along with the coaching staff, would have had a word or two with the batsmen and an improved showing is what they would have demanded for. Coming to the West Indies bowlers, they did not have a lot of runs to bowl with in the opening game but they lacked the sting despite having having good bowlers like Roach, Rampaul and Narine. This is something Sammy would be worried about and the assured manner in which the Bangladeshi batters played against West Indies would have made the skipper ask his bowlers to show some venom. The visitors have a quality line-up to easily overcome the hosts, but they should not take the Bangladesh team lightly, a mistake which they did in the first match.Team Updates:Bangladesh will be without the services of Shakib Al Hasan for the remaining ODIs as the all-rounder has failed to recover from a shin injury and has been advised rest for six weeks. West Indies, who lost Tino Best to a hamstring injury even before the limited overs games began, do not have any other injury concerns presently. Both teams are likely to field the same eleven that played in the first ODI.Quotes:It is a result of consistent performance in the one-day format, especially after the Asia Cup: Abdur Razzak attributes the win to Bangladesh's consistency.It is a matter of us taking that extra time, that extra over or two, to continue what we have been doing: Kieron Pollard wants the batsmen to show more application.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Abul Hasan, Nasir Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Sohag Gazi, Mahmudullah, Naeem Islam, Tamim Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafe Mortaza, Jahurul Islam, Mominul Haque, Shafiul IslamWest Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Chris Gayle, Veerasammy Permaul, Ravi Rampaul, Marlon Samuels, Darren Bravo, Sunil Narine, Kieran Powell, Kemar Roach, Jason Holder, Andre Russell, Lendl Simmons, Devon Thomas(w), Kieron Pollard, Dwayne SmithLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
