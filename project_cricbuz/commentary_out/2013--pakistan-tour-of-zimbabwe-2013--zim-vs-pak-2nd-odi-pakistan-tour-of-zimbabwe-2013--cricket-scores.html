We made a few mistakes in the last game but we will recover. It's only a matter of how you go and how you execute. Both the seamers are really a strength for us and I hope everybody chips in and take wickets. We have one change - Abdur Rehman comes in for Sohail.'Taylor: 'There is a green tinge on the pitch and it looks like the first hour is going to be crucial. I hope the bowlers utilize it to their advantage. It is a big day for us and we will look to seal the series today itself. No changes in the team.'Zimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldHello and welcome for the second ODI between Zimbabwe and Pakistan. The hosts made history a couple of days ago by beating the visitors after 15 years. Can they go one step further and win the series? Stay tuned. The toss and more coming up your way shortly.PreviewAfter suffering a shock defeat at the hands of the hosts in the first ODI, Pakistan will be looking forward to put the past behind and level the 3-match ODI series in the second ODI at the Harare Sports Club. On the other hand, Zimbabwe will be keen to repeat their disciplined performance in the first game and clinch the series.ZimbabweZimbabwe beat Pakistan after a gap of 15 years putting up a great show in the first game of the series and now stand a good chance of upsetting the visitors to register a bilateral series win against a top-ranked side since they defeated New Zealand 2-1 in 2001.After restricting Pakistan to 244, the batsmen managed to chase down the total in the 49th over losing only 3 wickets in the process. Hamilton Masakadza was the man of the match with a well crafted innings of 85. He along with Vusi Sibanda put up an impressive 107-run opening stand that laid foundation for an easy chase. A patient unbeaten 43 from the skipper Brendan Taylor ensured Zimbabwe won the match with 10 balls to spare. Earlier in the day, the pacers had done a good job making it difficult for the Pakistan batsmen to score easy runs. The hosts also showed a great deal of maturity while fielding and were ahead of their game after a disappointing performance in the T20Is.It is most likely that Zimbabwe will go with the same team combination that won them the historic game. The openers are in great form and the middle order has been decent while bowlers have done a good job so far. If they pay attention to their bowling in the death overs and start off well while batting, they have a good chance of sealing the series tomorrow itself. Given the form the players are currently in and with the confidence running high after the historic win, the hosts will be be eager to prove that their first victory against the Asian team in 15 years was not a fluke.PakistanAfter dominating the hosts in the T20Is, Pakistan put up a disappointing performance in the first match, humiliating themselves in a straightforward loss against Zimbabwe. Misbah-ul-Haq (83*) and Mohammad Hafeez (70) were involved in a fantastic stand but the middle order was not able to capitalize on the good score and lost wickets at regular intervals thereafter. Compared to the high bowling standard they usually display, the attack in the match looked surprisingly lackluster. Apart from Saeed Ajmal, no bowler was able to make a mark and struggled to find breakthroughs. The pacers, in particular, had no success with the wickets and were expensive.Ahmed Shehzad had a great T20I series, hitting two fabulous half centuries that sealed both the matches for the visitors. Although, he started off slowly in the first ODI and was not able to put up too many runs on the board, he has been in a brilliant form and will have to recall his T20 exploits to regain the lost touch. The only person who has looked consistent in the Pakistani batting outfit is Mohammad Hafeez who has been displaying plenty of patient performances. Pakistan also have a lot of experience in the form of Shahid Afridi, but the senior player has been inconsistent with both the bat and the ball in recent times. He will have to step up to the mark if Pakistan want to avoid further embarrassment at the hands of the minnow team. QuotesMalcolm Waller: "We know how good Pakistan are and we know the quality of their players, we know they are going to come back harder on us."Misbah-ul-Haq: "We need to just come back strongly and play our A game, our best game then you can really win these games."Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Brendan Taylor(w/c), Tendai Chatara, Elton Chigumbura, Michael Chinouya, Timycen Maruma, Shingirai Masakadza, Hamilton Masakadza, Tino Mawoyo, Natsai Mushangwe, Tinotenda Mutombodzi, Tinashe Panyangara, Vusi Sibanda, Sikandar Raza, Prosper Utseya, Brian Vitori, Malcolm Waller, Sean Williams, Richmond MutumbamiPakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Abdur Rehman, Ahmed Shehzad, Anwar Ali, Asad Ali, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Irfan, Nasir Jamshed, Saeed Ajmal, Umar Amin, Shahid AfridiLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
