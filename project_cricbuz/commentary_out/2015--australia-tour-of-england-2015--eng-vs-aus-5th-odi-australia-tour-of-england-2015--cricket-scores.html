The opener never looked at ease, flashed at a wide one and edged it to the keeper. There were some bizzare tactics from Smith and Finch who were content in defending and looked like they wanted to play for the break. However, that didn't go to plan as Smith edged a drive off Wood. If England can pick up a couple of early wickets after the break, that can set the cat among the pigeons. Join us back in a few minutes for the resumption..

Finch and Burns are out in the centre. Willey marks his run-up. Just one slip in place. Here we go...Ben Stokes played with a positive mindset even as he lost his mates at the other end. Moeen Ali and David Willey were sent back in one Mitchell Marsh over. Marsh also accounted for Stokes trapping him right in front. Adil Rashid and Mark Wood scored a few boundaries to take the total past 100. However, Australia cleaned up the tail quickly. Marsh was the pick of the bowlers with 4 wickets and was well backed up by the rest. This is in fact the lowest total for England in ODIs against Australia since 2007. With a target of 139, Australia have one foot in the door, unless England pull off a superlative effort. Stay tuned as the Australian innings will begin soon... They say Australia rise to the occasion in big games and their bowlers have certainly vindicated that saying. After being asked to bowl first, Mitchell Starc set the tone very early. Jason Roy failed to keep out a low inswinging full toss, didn't review and was out in the first over. Alex Hales' poor series was put to rest by Hastings and Taylor for the first time in the series couldn't get going. Morgan was then struck by a brutal Starc bouncer. The England skipper looked in discomfort and took the sensible decision of walking off - retired hurt.3

ENGLAND:0.4 Starc to Jason Roy, out Lbw!! A shocker from umpire Wilson, and Roy took his own sweet time before trudging off. Why didn't he opt to review this? Replays suggest that impact was outside leg and the ball was slipping further down the leg-side. It was another inswinging low full-toss from Starc, Roy was looking to play the on-drive, missed and was struck low on the pads. The impact was outside leg-stump and it was missing the stumps. A poor call from the umpire, even more poor from the two batsmen as they kept on pondering about a review. They took too much time and ended up making the wrong call. Lucky wicket for Starc.

Hot-Spot shows a big mark, but is it bat hitting the pad or was there an inside edge on that?

He checks with the RTS and concludes that the ball hit the bat first, the original call was OUT and it has been reversed. Roy survives
ENGLAND:0.1 Starc to Jason Roy, FOUR, swing for Starc, but he swings it down the leg-side. Roy looks to flick, Wade dives to his left but the ball swings away further, given as runs, must have got a faint nickJason Roy and Hales are at the crease. Jason Roy is on strike. Starc will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Can Roy and Hales get England off to a solid start? Starc is back and he will open the bowling. Two slips in place for the outside edge..Pitch Report: 'It's a typical Old Trafford pitch, it's a glorious day, but the early start might change things a bit. The pitch is rock hard, you can score a lot of runs on it. It might take spin later on, all set for a cracker of a day,' reckons David Lloyd.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Joe Burns, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Marsh, Ashton Agar, John Hastings, Mitchell Starc, Pat CumminsEngland (Playing XI): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jonathan Bairstow(w), Moeen Ali, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Mark Wood, Reece TopleySmith: 'The wicket looks pretty dry, we would have also batted first. Two changes for us, Pattinson and Stoinis are out, Starc and Agar are back. We would love to win each and every series, this is like a final for us.'Morgan: 'We will bat first. The conditions look similar to the third ODI. Considering we were 2-0 down, we have done well to fight back with this young team. Reece Topley makes his ODI debut, he replaces Liam Plunkett. We just wanted to have a look at him (Topley), he's been with the team for a long time.'England have won the toss and have opted to batFor Australia, Marcus Stoinis and James Pattinson are not warming up. Mitchell Starc is set to return, Ashton Agar might be back as well.The news from the England camp is that Reece Topley is making his ODI debut and former skipper Nasser Hussain has just presented him the cap. So who goes out? We will get more news in a short while as the toss is not too far away. Stay tuned...Australian captain Steven Smith has admitted that his batsmen have not played the England spinners well and that is something that is going to be very crucial today if they are to win the series. Smith also said that they always want to win every series and one can expect Australia to come hard at their oppenents today. Will we see a few changes in their line-up with the series up for grabs? Mitch Starc was rested for the last game. Marcus Stoinis took Ashton Agar's place, but we could see the left-arm spinner back in action today, especially with conditions set to suit spin.Alex Hales' form though is a bit of a concern for the home side. 1, 22, 18, 9, 0 are his scores in the last 5 ODIs. Jason Roy, Hales' partner, has been batting very well at the other end. If Hales can get things going today, the duo could give Australia a tough time. David Willey's inclusion in the last game worked wonders for England as he gave them early breakthroughs - something that was not achieved in the first three ODIs. When the last time these two sides played here, the pitch offered quite a bit of spin and both Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali were impressive. In fact, the latter even recorded his career-best figures (3/32).It was turning out to be a bat-first series, but England changed the trend with a magnificent run chase at Headingley a couple of days ago. From 0-2 down, Eoin Morgan and Co. showed great character to win the next two and force a decider. We are all set for a cracking finish folks! Hello and a warm welcome to the final ODI of the 5-match series. Both teams return to Old Trafford, where they played the 3rd ODI, for the decider. At the post-match presentation after the last game, Morgan mentioned that the momentum is with his side. Probably the fact that they beat Australia earlier in the series at this ground will boost their confidence even more.Preview:Australia's long and gruelling tour of England is set for an enthralling finale as Eoin Morgan & Co. host Steven Smith's side in the fifth and final ODI of the series at the Old Trafford in Manchester on Sunday. The Aussies tried to get over their Ashes drubbing with strong performances in the first two ODIs but the hosts made a stunning comeback to level the series in Leeds on Friday.Sunday's fixture will give Australia a chance to put a smile on the faces of their fans but Morgan's men have momentum on their side to pile on the misery for their nemesis.Date: September 13, 2015Time: 15:00 IST, 09:30 GMTVenue: Old Trafford, ManchesterWeather: Sunny with a bit of showers around. Maximum temperature of 17 degree Celsius.England:Spirited display in the third and fourth fixtures of the series has given England the opportunity to send Australia home empty-handed. After a game's rest, leader of the bowling attack, Steven Finn is expected to return to the side. He is most-likely to replace Mark Wood, who leaked runs in excess of seven-an-over in the two ODIs he has played in the series. After a rollicking start in Leeds, left-armer David Willey is expected to keep his place while Liam Plunkett will also be a vital cog in the bowling attack. Plunkett had snared three wickets in the third ODI that was played in the same venue as Sunday's final. The duo of Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, however, will hold the aces on a wicket that provides a bit of something for the spinners. In the 20 overs between then, Moeen and Rashid conceded just 73 runs and accounted for five Aussie wickets in the third ODI. As far as England's batting is concerned, Morgan will hope for a bit more effort from his top-order, specially the exciting Alex Hales who has endured a lukewarm series so far. Probable XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan, Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, David Willey, Steven Finn Australia:While England's sole swap seems straightforward, Australia have a bit of a selection headache ahead of themselves. The think-tank would be keen to bring back spinner Ashton Agar and the leader of the attack, Mitchell Starc. They will also have to make the choice of benching two out of the three - James Pattinson, Marcus Stoinis and John Hastings. Pattinson has been wicketless in the last two fixtures and conceded 73 runs in nine overs in Manchester and is likely to make way for Starc. Between debutant Stoinis and utility player Hastings, the choice is complicated. Stoinis bowled four overs for 17 runs on his debut in Manchester but failed with the bat while Hastings played a blinder (34 off 26) with the bat but was taken to the cleaners by the English batsmen (0/56 in 6.2 overs).Smith will be less worried about the batting department which, barring his own form and that of his openers, came to the fore with superb knocks from Maxwell, Bailey and Matthew Wade. Probable XI: Joe Burns, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, George Bailey, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade, Ashton Agar, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, James Pattinson Quotes"Going into Sunday, the guys are full of confidence and really looking forward to it. We have had a little bit of success so far this summer and hopefully that continues because if things go well that accelerates our learning as we go along. Sitting here at two-all, having beaten New Zealand 3-2, we are pretty confident. " - Eoin Morgan exuded a lot of confidence following England's comeback in the series."I guess the good thing is that Sunday is going to be a final and we've played a lot of them and been quite successful in a lot of them." - Pat Cummins is upbeat despite England riding the momentum wave.Teams:Australia (From): Joe Burns, Aaron Finch, Steven Smith(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), Peter Handscomb, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, James Pattinson, John Hastings, Marcus Stoinis, Ashton AgarEngland (From): Alex Hales, Jason Roy, James Taylor, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jonathan Bairstow(w), Moeen Ali, Liam Plunkett, David Willey, Adil Rashid, Steven Finn, Mark Wood, Sam Billings, Reece TopleyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
