Umpire Aleem Dar goes upstairs as the Zimbabwean fielders appeal in unison. Looks like a tough call for the TV umpire, after numerous replays the third umpire rules it in the favour of batsman. There wasn't enough evidence as differect angles show different pictures. All the fielders in the Zimbabwean camp look absolutely gutted and seems like a crane is needed to carry the players back to their fielding positions.
