I think we should get this target easily."Baressi got going but he weighed down the team with his sluggish strike-rate. Bopara and Tredwell also shone in the middle overs. All in all, the English bowlers clicked in unison. They fielding veered between odinary and extraordinary but the bowlers more than made up for it. England will back themselves to chase it down. Do join us for the chase in a short while.Myburgh and Swart ensured a decent start for England but once Stuart Broad came into the fray, it was all downhill for the Dutch.

Swart is on strike. Moeen Ali will open the attackOkay then! The teams walk out for the anthems. The Netherlands openers stride out to the middle. Myburgh has blown hot and cold through this tournament. The Dutch will want him to fire today if they are to topple England. As is the norm, Ali will open the bowling for England.Pitch Report: "The pitch has a bit of grass on it but it is quite dry. This might suit the Netherlands more and bowlers like Ahsan Malik would love to bowl on this. Probably England will have to change their combination a bit," reckons Nick Knight.Teams:England (Playing XI): Michael Lumb, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad(c), Tim Bresnan, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, Stephen ParryNetherlands (Playing XI): Stephan Myburgh, Michael Swart, Wesley Barresi(w), Peter Borren(c), Tom Cooper, Ben Cooper, Logan van Beek, Mudassar Bukhari, Timm van der Gugten, Pieter Seelaar, Ahsan MalikBorren: "We have one opportunity. We are very keen to put on a 100% performance, having put in 75-80% in the last couple of games . We would have fielded first as well. That is the trend here. We should work hard with the bat now. We are going for the same team. 7 games in a row. We are a balanced side. We have the right XI. We want to put a 100% game today as I said. If we put a full game together, we have a chance."Broad: "The knee is fine. I am looking forward to this game. We are disappointed to be knocked out. We want to have a bowl first. This gives a chance to adapt to the conditions. This is the first day game for us. The ball may turn under lights. Parry, the left-arm spinner comes in for Jade. We let us down in the two night games on the field. We will have to make sure our skills are good today. We know that they are a dangerous side. They pushed both South Africa and New Zealand."England have won the toss and have opted to fieldWith the T20 Cup elimination capping a horrid winter, England find themselves at a crossroads. Can the Dutch boys rub more salt into their wounds? Or will England strike back to slay the demons of 2009 and put the associate nation in its place? For starters, the English bowlers,who have struggled to cope up with the wet outfield and dew, will be better off today, for this is an afternoon clash. Toss and much more heading your way.Following Netherlands' loss against New Zealand, their skipper, Peter Borren, reiterated that his team was still hungry to pull off an upset to make an indelible mark in the T20 Cup. They have experienced a roller coaster ride, crashing down to earth after a sensational, albeit unexpected, entry into the tournament proper. The Men in bright Orange will be keen to reproduce their heroics of Lord's 2009, wherein they stunned much fancied neighbours, England.PreviewThe match may have no context with both teams already knocked out of the tournament but it presents an opportunity for Netherlands, the Associate nation, to pip one over a Test playing nation. England have little else but pride to play for and it could prove a slippery one if they take Netherlands lightly.England:The batting has clicked all through but the bowling failures have cost England dearly. Stuart Broad has been criticised for not using himself in crucial junctures and the skipper will be looking to prove the naysayers wrong. The captain will also be doing his best to motivate a team which has been knocked out despite the odd moment of brilliance. They felt hard done by in the rain-affected game against New Zealand. Hales' brilliance saw them through against England but they came up short against de Villiers' magic versus South Africa. The last game also provides them a chance to test out some new combinations at the risk of suffering further embarrassment.Netherlands:They have been the representatives of the Associate nations world over. Like most teams of their ilk, Netherlands were desperate to be taken seriously and prove that they are not pushovers. They were crumpled by Sri Lanka but managed better shows against South Africa and New Zealand. Against South Africa, they looked set for a win at one stage but could not see it through. A demoralised England awaiting their journey back home presents a nice little chance to pull off an upset. Netherlands only aim of the tournament was to prove that they belong and they still have a chance to do it.Quotes:It does represent a banana skin, as it has to a couple of the other teams - or very close to that says Ashley Giles, the England coachTeams:Netherlands (From): Stephan Myburgh, Michael Swart, Wesley Barresi(w), Peter Borren(c), Tom Cooper, Ben Cooper, Logan van Beek, Mudassar Bukhari, Timm van der Gugten, Pieter Seelaar, Ahsan Malik, Eric Szwarczynski, Tom Heggelman, Vivian Kingma, Michael RipponEngland (From): Michael Lumb, Alex Hales, Moeen Ali, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler(w), Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad(c), Tim Bresnan, Chris Jordan, James Tredwell, Jade Dernbach, Ian Bell, Chris Woakes, Stephen Parry, Craig KieswetterLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
