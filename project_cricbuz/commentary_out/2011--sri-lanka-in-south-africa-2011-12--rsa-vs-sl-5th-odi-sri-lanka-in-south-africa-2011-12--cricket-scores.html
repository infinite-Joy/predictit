Sri Lanka have left themselves a mountain to climb if they are to eke out another winSouth Africa started really slowly and lost their second wicket at a time when they were just looking to accelerate. In came AB De Villiers and the complexion of the game was changed. He played many audacious strokes and some of the confidence rubbed off on his predecessor, Smith. Smith switched gears after getting to his fifty and brought up his first hundred in more than two years. Together they put on a 186 run stand in 28 overs which propelled their side to a good score. Malinga and Perera who were so good in the last match, were taken for aplenty. The Lankans will feel that on such a good batting deck they are in with a chance. Join us in 30 minutes i.e. at 17:50 IST i.e. 14:15 local time for their reply.Faf: ABD is in top form. He can play any shot he wants. He is making use of his good form. The wicket is a bit two paced.

Graeme Smith is on strike. Nuwan Kulasekara will open the attackTwo slips in place as Nuwan Kulasekara comes in. Umpire Marais Erasmus says play.Right, the action is all set to start. The Sri Lankan players are in the huddle. The South African openers will want to get off to a great start on a pitch that might offer the bowlers some help in the first hour. Sid V here to take you through.The teams have lined up for the national anthem. This time, the Sri Lankan national anthem 'Sri Lanka Matha' is being played first. Their anthem was not played at Kimberley. Next, it is the South African national anthem.Sangakkara: From the first ODI, we showed steady improvement. We were 30 runs short in the 3rd ODI. Chasing down 300 in the last ODI was a big boost. The more we win, the more it does for the belief. Alviro took a great catch to dismiss me in the previous match as I thought it was going for six. The run-out in Bloemfontein was also great but one has to be careful as South Africa are a great fielding side. Thissara and Chandimal have batted well. The next tour is about 3-4 years time and this might be my last tour here.Tsotsobe: I have worked hard to achieve these results. The experience that I have had while bowling in the nets is when I bowl with a cross-seam, it tends to bounce a bit more sometimes and sometimes it keeps low. Two different results work well for the bowlers. It is a great responsibility to be the leader of the attack in ODIs. It has been a challenge for me this season due to the injuries that I have sustained.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews, Nuwan Kulasekara, Thissara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Rangana Herath, Lasith MalingaSouth Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith, Alviro Petersen, Colin Ingram, AB de Villiers(w/c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Albie Morkel, Robin Peterson, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Lonwabo TsotsobePitch Report: There is nothing on this pitch. The cracks are tiny but the pitch is excellent to bat on. HD Ackerman reckons that since it is a day game, there may not be much of seam movement.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to fieldAB de Villiers: I would have bowled as well. Albie Morkel replaces Philander. We want to end the series on a high and garner momentum ahead of the long tour of New Zealand. We want to perform in front of big crowds and we want to make them proud.Dilshan: We will bowl first. We chased well yesterday and we want to continue the trend. We are unchanged. We want to end the series on a high.Live visuals from the ground show cloudy conditions. There is rain forecast for the day. Let us hope it stays away.Welcome to the fifth and final ODI between South Africa and Sri Lanka from Johannesburg. South Africa will look to end their home summer on a high after suffering a loss at Kimberley. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will want to win this final match and go into the tri-series in Australia with some renewed confidence. Join us in a bit for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Anoop NavalIt is said that a prey is most dangerous when it is cornered and has nowhere to go. Sri Lanka proved that right by lashing back at South Africa and finally scoring a win in the 4th ODI of the Sunfoil series at the De Beers Oval at Kimbery. It was high time the lions realised that all they had to do is look for inspiration among their own ranks. Skipper Tillakaratne Dilshan and Thissara Perera played some responsible cricket to romp home a resounding victory, helping Lanka snap out of a 6 ODI losing streak. Throughout the series, the Proteas have dominated, thrashed and added insult to injury to the World Cup finalists, clinching the series which now stands at 3-1 in South Africa's favour. But irrespective of the said status, it will now be quite interesting to see if Lanka make most of their return to form or will they collapse yet again, like they did during the Test series after the amazing win at Durban.South Africa:Considering the team's performance so far, the Proteas have been at their element throughout the series. The absence of Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis did seem to affect the Proteas in the third and fourth ODIs as the mood on the field wasn't as explosive as in the first two games. Ofcourse, the fact stands that mother nature had a bit of a soft corner for the hosts at Blomfontien, or the Lankan bowlers looked like they really wanted a bite out of the Protean batters. The fact that South Africa won the match by just 4 runs speaks volumes about how close they were to losing the match, considering their previous victories in the series have been by huge margins.It is the bowling that was a setback for the hosts in the fourth ODI. When seven bowlers try to hold the batsmen in check but all of them end up with economy rates above 5, it becomes pretty hard to blame the batsmen. Especially when you pose a run a ball target and fail to defend it. Although Lonwabo Tsotsobe bagged three wickets for 51, he got zilch support from his colleagues. Vernon Philander, who looked flawless during the tests, seemed to have forgotten what to do with the ball resulting in a sound drubbing at the hands of the Lankan batsmen. The Proteas have always had the problem of getting carried away with themselves and it would do them much good not to let the Lankans run away with the 5th ODI.Sri Lanka:Sri Lanka have improved their performance with every passing match, and it has shown in all the aspects of their game. They could probably have won the third ODI if they had managed to cencede just four less runs, or managed to send one more South African batter home. But having successfully chased a total of 300 in the De Beers Oval(this being the first time they have reached the 300 mark in 19 ODIs) with more than an over to spare, the Sri Lankan team can finally focus on something other than damage control. with their ascending progress, their overall performance in the 4th ODI painted quite a contradictory picture about them as compared to the rest of the tour. The lions finally seemed to have woken up from hibernation and looked like they were back on the hunt, lost series all forgotten and full of new found vigour and energy. Skipper Dilshan has batted in a really dull manner throughout, and finding his game in the fourth ODI is obviously a relief. This might as well be his last chance as skipper and he will definitely look to perform well and manage to retain his resposibility of leading the team again. Dinesh Chandimal has done a good job with the bat but he might want to get a big score to get the team ashore. The rediscovery in their batting talent during the fourth ODI could be the key to Sri Lanka's success - provided they retain it. Their bowlers could take some confidence from the batsmen and try to restrict a strong South African batting under 250. There is no reason not to register another win if the batsmen play their game and the bowlers find form in the 5th and final ODI. Skipper Dilshan agreed, when he said "We need to finish strongly. A 3-2 result will be a fantastic effort, but we have to play well. We can't relax because South Africa are a good team and they are playing well. We know we are capable, and know we could do much better than the first game." Sri Lanka will want to finish the exciting Sunfoil series on a winning note.Final Word:The Proteas have nothing to lose and will look to come-back hard at the Lankans like they did in the Tests. Sri Lanka look like they've found the spine to stand strong and all they have to do is to continue the form. All said and one, the 5th ODI promises at The Wanderers, Johannesburg promises a contest worthy of more than the dead-rubber status.Teams:South Africa (From): AB de Villiers(w/c), Graeme Smith, Morne Morkel, Alviro Petersen, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Johan Botha, Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Albie Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Colin IngramSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Dilhara Fernando, Rangana Herath, Mahela Jayawardene, Thissara Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dhammika Prasad, Nuwan Kulasekara, Kosala Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Upul Tharanga, Sachithra SenanayakeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
