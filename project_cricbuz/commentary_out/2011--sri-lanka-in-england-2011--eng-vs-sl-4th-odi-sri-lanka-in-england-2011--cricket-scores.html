The momentum is back with SL after they lost the opening ODI of the series. England will look to bounce back after suffering back to back losses. Under the lights the ball will swing a bit and England will be hoping to put a win under their belt using the conditions. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info.....Preview by Siddharth VishwanathanIt seems that England and ODIs simply do not go hand in hand. It might sound strange considering that this nation played the first ever ODI match in cricket. After strong showings in the Test series, they have always faltered in the subsequent ODI series. After winning the Ashes in 2009 and 2010, they were soundly thrashed 6-1 by Australia in the subsequent ODI series on both occasions. After a strong show in the Tests against Pakistan in 2006, they squandered the ODI series and managed 2-2 draw. After a 2-0 win over New Zealand at home in 2008, they lost the ODI series against them 3-1. It was the same situation in the NZ tour, when they were trounced 3-1 in the ODIs but won the Tests 2-1. Now, with England 2-1 down, they risk the chance of losing another ODI series unless they do something dramatic.Alastair Cook has immediately realized that captaincy is a bed filled with thorns and roses. After a brilliant win at the Oval, the team has once again struggled to maintain momentum. James Anderson, the wrecker-in-chief at the Oval, was carted around at Leeds and was ineffective at Lords. Bresnan, who came back into the squad after a calf strain, has struggled to get back into the groove. Stuart Broad has looked woeful in the series and is yet to pick up a wicket. The only bright spot for England in the bowling has been Swann but he has lacked support.In the batting, Kieswetter has given the team starts but has failed to carry on. Cook will gain a lot of confidence following his century at Lords but looking at the way how he approached the innings, questions will be asked. Kevin Pietersen will be cursing his luck after wasting three starts. If left arm spinners are his bane of existence, then Jeevan Mendis has proven to be a thorn in his flesh. The part-time leg spinner has snapped him three out of three times in this series and KP will be looking to avoid a repeat. Morgan, Bell and Trott have not contributed significantly in the lower middle order and that has been their weak link. For England to challenge Sri Lanka, their batting must click.Sri Lanka have once again shown their prowess in the limited over format. After looking all at sea in the Tests, they have come into their own in the ODIs. After their thrashing at the Oval, they have bounced back remarkably. The batting looks in great shape for the Lankans. Mahela, Sangakkara and Chandimal have been superb with the bat. If Jayawardene's century at Leeds was masterful, Chandimal's ton at Lords was fearless. These three batsmen will hold the key for the Lankans in the remaining two ODIs. SL will hope that their skipper, Dilshan, is back among the runs. The middle order remains a worry but the solidity of Chandimal will be a welcome relief for the Lankans. Going into the fourth ODI, Sri Lanka have the chance to win their second bilateral series in a row in England after their 5-0 whitewash in the 2006 series.The inexperienced bowling line-up, barring the exception of Malinga, have chipped in at regular intervals. Lakmal has been consistently among the wickets despite leaking runs. Malinga has not been at his lethal best but he has delivered at vital times for the team along with Kulasekara. Randiv has been the key player in this series. He has consistently choked the English batsmen in the middle overs and he has also picked up wickets consistently. England will have to negate Randiv's tight bowling if they have to build momentum.This D/N match at Trent Bridge is the best chance for England to square the series and take it to the decider at Manchester. England will believe that under lights, when the ball swings, the Sri Lankans are vulnerable. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, will want to overcome their weakness against the swinging ball and seal the series.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Graeme Swann, Jonathan Trott, Jade Dernbach, Chris Woakes, Samit Patel, Craig Kieswetter(w), Ravi Bopara, Tim BresnanSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene, Suraj Randiv, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Thissara Perera, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Thilina Kandamby, Sanath Jayasuriya, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dhammika PrasadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
