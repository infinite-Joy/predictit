This was a good length delivery nibbling away outside off, Shehzad pushes at that ill-advicedly and plays away from the body to get a genuine nick that is easily grasped by Hashim Amla at first slip.

When debutants perform against a top side, it is a positive sign especially with the world cup coming up.'AB: 'We gonna have a bowl here. It seems like good ODI wicket. We want to put ourselves under pressure and see if we cam chase. We got the three big guys missing. It is a good opportunity for others. Vernon will open the bowling We have to get across the line. We have an opportunity to rectify the mistakes today. It's a good crowd here at Centurion.'The pitch appears rather docile and promises plenty of runs for the batsmenPhilander, Parnell and Davids get a look in for South Africa. Pakistan have rung in four changes and Shahid Afridi has been handed a breather.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Ahmed Shehzad, Umar Amin, Sohaib Maqsood, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Asad Shafiq, Umar Akmal(w), Bilawal Bhatti, Anwar Ali, Sohail Tanvir, Abdur Rehman, Saeed AjmalSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Henry Davids, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Vernon Philander, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Imran TahirSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to fieldCan the depleted South African outfit avert the whitewash which looms large? This match is also at the mercy of the weather gods as meteorologists have predicted mild showers later in the afternoon. Toss, teams and all that to follow shortly. Do stay tuned folks.Now, its South Africa's turn to entertain reservations about their batting. Hashim Amla and ABD sparkled in that nail-biter at Port Elizabeth but the other batsmen came up woefully short. To aggravate South Africa's woes, the experienced triumvirate of Graeme Smith, Dale Steyn and Jacques Kallis will sit out of this clash. Whilst, Smith is on compassionate leave following the tragic demise of his grandmother, Steyn and Kallis are out with injury niggles.Ahmed Shehzad's aggressive ton and Junaid's impeccable bowling reiterated the fact that Pakistan could conquer any opposition on their day.Hello and welcome to the third and final ODI between South Africa and Pakistan at Centurion. With Pakistan storming back from the horrendous collapses in UAE and wrapping up this series already, this fixture has been rendered a dead rubber. Pakistan's uber-cool skipper, Misbah-ul-Haq though emphasized that the task is not complete and his boys will be gunning to mortify South Africa to a whitewash.PreviewHaving lost both the ODIs, South Africa will be keen on ending the series on a winning note when they take on a high-flying Pakistan team in the final ODI. What a turnaround for Pakistan this has been. They were down and out for the count, even before they had set sail for South Africa, but not without reason. This was the third bilateral meeting between the two sides this year and the first two had been overwhelmingly dominated by the Africans, periods of Pakistani brilliance notwithstanding. South Africa is among the most difficult countries to tour and it was certainly going to be a lot more tough for a team that was low on confidence and positive results. How they turned it around over the course of a T20 International and two ODIs, only the Pakistan team would know, but the victories are for real.PakistanIf the first game was the bowlers' gift to Misbah-ul-Haq, the second was more of a statement by the batsmen, who had been hauled up in public by the captain for some callous performances. Ahmed Shehzad's brilliant century and Junaid Khan's sensational last over brought back memories of old - a mercurial side which on its day could beat any team in the world. Over the course of the last 18, months, Pakistan have hardly looked like they could even compete with Zimbabwe but India's decision to challenge the FTP and cut short their tour, gave Misbah's men a rather unexpected lifeline. Success in South Africa should now quickly brush away the horrors of the Zimbabwe debacle and allow the team to take on Sri Lanka with a lot more confidence next month.Pakistan would now be gunning for a 3-0 whitewash and it could be well within their grasp for Dale Steyn, Jacques Kallis and Graeme Smith will sit out of the final ODI, rendering the hosts weak. Ahmed Shehzad has promised so much and delivered so little that even his die-hard supporters would have been left frustrated with his failures. However, a compact 102 against a top quality South African attack should do the 23-year-old a world of good. Misbah is looking for his top order batsmen to play the big innings and his third ODI ton would have placed Shehzad in the captain's good books.The bowling has been mighty impressive as usual with Junaid Khan leading the way for a bunch of very talented pacers. Another player to watch out for would be, Bilawal Bhatti whose cracker of a debut with bat and then ball sealed South Africa's fate. And with Saeed Ajmal in the side, any bowling attack would look all the more potent. South Africa will be under pressure.South AfricaHaving thrown away 2 brilliant chances to get a win under their belt, AB de Villiers' men will be eager to ensure they suffer no more slip-ups and give their fans something to cheer about. While South Africa's famed bowling line-up has lived up to its expectations it is the batting department that has been woefully under-performing. With stalwarts like Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers and JP Duminy among others in the side, one would expect the hosts to dominate any opposition attack. But while there have been flashes of brilliance from the likes of their skipper, vice-captain and their most experienced player, none of the others have rallied around the set players and made it count. de Villiers and Amla showed why they are so highly regarded in the last game but they left the finishing job to the lower-order which proved very costly for the Proteas as they were edged out by 1 run. Duminy showed glimpses of form in the first ODI, but South Africa will need more from the left-hander if they are to claim a consolation. Graeme Smith's absence may well be a blessing in disguise for the hosts, with newcomer Henry Davids keen to make a mark in his debut ODI.On the bowling front South Africa looked well settled, but with injuries ruling out both Kallis and Dale Steyn, the Proteas are in for a test. Steyn's red hot form with the ball will be sorely missed while the experience and all-round talent of Kallis would have been something South Africa desperately needed for the final ODI. They however are well equipped with the likes of Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander and Ryan McLaren capable of replacing the experienced duo.
