SRI LANKA:49.2 49.2 Brett Lee to Nuwan Kulasekara, FOUR, Sri Lanka win! And Kulasekara leaps in joy before going across to hug Perera. Length ball and some width outside off - Kulasekara throws his bat and slaps it through the off side, all the fielders were inside the circle there and Kulasekara split them easily. Terrific effort this by Sri Lanka, they are easily the best side in the tournament now, which reflects in the points tableKulasekara can bat.. no need to panic here
SRI LANKA:49.1  Brett Lee to Thissara Perera, 1 run, Perera makes room and goes down the leg but Lee follows him, Perera adjusts and flicks it straight to fine leg3 runs from the last over. Sri Lanka surely can't lose this.. but let's wait for the official confirmation. Who knows? Maybe Lee will get a hat-trick now..
SRI LANKA:48.6  Christian to Thissara Perera, 1 run, outside off again, Perera once again plays across the line and gets a single to deep mid wicket, that's what they wanted - Perera retains the strike
SRI LANKA:48.5  Christian to Thissara Perera, SIX, Thissara Perera!!!!! He is dealing in boundaries and turning it around big time! Poor bowling though from Christian - you just can't bowl length to big hitters in the death - but that's exactly what he does, Perera heaves across and murders it way over deep mid wicket, Clarke has his hands on his head..
SRI LANKA:48.4  Christian to Thissara Perera, FOUR, Perera the man! What a strike that is! Length ball outside off, Perera goes across and swing across the line, heaves it along the ground and splits deep square leg and fine leg to perfection, 4 vital runs!Nuwan Kulasekara, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:48.3  Christian to Mathews, out Caught by Warner!! That's an important wicket, and intelligent bowling! Slow off cutter on the off, Mathews doesn't read it well and looks to loft it over long off, doesn't get much power behind the shot and holes out to the man there. Warner will not drop those, and Sri Lanka will have to finish this without one of their best finishers! Mathews c Warner b Christian 24(31) [4s-1] Christian to Mathews, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:48.2 Christian to Mathews, 2 runs, in the air for a long time but it falls safe! Lucky for both the batsman and the bowler through - that was a full toss which should have been smashed over the ropes, Mathews goes for a whip but doesn't get hold of it, falls safely between long on and deep mid for a coupleThird man is inside the circle..
SRI LANKA:48.1 Christian to Thissara Perera, leg byes, 1 run, good start for Christian, begins with a yorker on the legs, Perera misses it as he tries to swing across the line but manages a leg bye to the off sideDaniel Christian [7.0-0-40-2] is back into the attack17 from 12 now. This over will decide the winner! Dan Christian will bowl it, which is a bit of a surprise.
SRI LANKA:47.6  Brett Lee to Mathews, no run, excellent bowling! Another yorker bang on middle stump line, Mathews digs it out to the on side, Perera wants a single and charges in but Lee runs in to prevent it
SRI LANKA:47.5  Brett Lee to Mathews, no run, better bowling, a quick yorker length delivery on the off, Mathews jams it back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:47.4  Brett Lee to Mathews, 2 runs, poor ball. Full toss on the off, Mathews picks his spot and drives it wide of extra cover, Forrest has to cover some distance from sweeper cover and the batsmen run well to convert it into a double
SRI LANKA:47.3  Brett Lee to Thissara Perera, 1 run, pitched up on the middle and leg, Perera drills it to long on
SRI LANKA:47.2  Brett Lee to Thissara Perera, 2 runs, not so good batting but good running, Lee bowls this back of a length and on the off, Perera is squared up and looks to play across the line, gets a thick leading edge that goes towards third man, Harris picks it up and fires in a throw to the keeper's end but Perera dived to make itThird umpire called for a run out appeal. Perera is the man in question. Looks safe though
SRI LANKA:47.1  Brett Lee to Mathews, 1 run, full ball on the middle and leg, Mathews drives it to long on, Perera runs the first one hard and wants 2, but the fielder is quick as wellBrett Lee [8.0-0-52-0] is back into the attack23 from 18. Lee comes into the attack.. what can he do?
SRI LANKA:46.6 Ryan Harris to Thissara Perera, FOUR, yupp. Too predictable indeed. Full and straight once again, Perera goes down in flash and paddles it away wide of short fine leg for a boundary, Thirimanne tried this shot but Perera executed it better, a much needed boundary for Sri Lanka
SRI LANKA:46.5 Ryan Harris to Mathews, 1 run, Angelo goes for a big shot but doesn't hit it well! Length ball on middle stump, Mathews lofts it towards long on but it goes on the bounce
SRI LANKA:46.4  Ryan Harris to Thissara Perera, 1 run, getting a bit too predictable is Harris, but he's doing the job. Another low full toss on the middle and leg, Perera whips it wide of long on, better running could have made it 2
SRI LANKA:46.3 Ryan Harris to Thissara Perera, no run, dot ball. Very full and dead straight, Perera gets down in time and jams it back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:46.2  Ryan Harris to Mathews, 1 run, full and angled in, Mathews flicks it to mid wicket who is standing at the edge of the circle, another single
SRI LANKA:46.1  Ryan Harris to Thissara Perera, 1 run, low full toss on the middle stump, Perera drives it straight down the ground, Harris manages a half stop but they get a single to long onLooks like Angelo Mathews is a Dhoni-type finisher, who doesn't mind taking the match till the end. He is happy dealing in singles, but needs some support from the lower order now. 31 from 24 now!
SRI LANKA:45.6  Hilfenhaus to Mathews, no run, good bowling, maintains it in tight areas around off, Mathews defends it softly and wants a quick single but Hilfenhaus runs in himself to prevent itThissara Perera, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:45.5  Hilfenhaus to Maharoof, out Caught by Ryan Harris!! Another wicket! And another wicket to a not-so-good ball. Short and rising down the leg, Maharoof plays an unconvincing whip-pull which goes high towards deep backward square leg, Harris judges it well and runs back a few steps to take a good tumbling catch. This match is heading towards a tight finish! Maharoof c Ryan Harris b Hilfenhaus 5(7) Hilfenhaus to Maharoof, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:45.4  Hilfenhaus to Mathews, 1 run, good batting, defends this softly to the off side and calls his partner for a quick single

SRI LANKA:45.1  Hilfenhaus to Maharoof, 2 runs, good stuff from Maharoof, this was a length delivery on the middle stump, he stays back and flicks it to deep backward square leg, runs well and makes it 2Chandimal was playing so well until that happened. He did try a few awkward shots towards the end, and that cost him his wicket. Match situation: 35 from 30. Still advantage Sri Lanka though..
SRI LANKA:44.6  Ryan Harris to Maharoof, 1 run, nice looking shot, comes on the frontfoot and drives one with a straight bat to long on, retains strike with a single

SRI LANKA:44.2  Ryan Harris to Chandimal, out Lbw!! Exactly what I was saying! What were you trying there, Mr. Chandimal?! Harris maintains it full and straight, Chandimal tries to be too cheeky and plays an awakward looking, half-hearted paddle-flick (I really don't know what to call that shot!) and misses. The umpire has absolutely no doubts about that one - plumb in front! The match is back in the balance again.. Chandimal lbw b Ryan Harris 80(100) [4s-7] Ryan Harris to Chandimal, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
SRI LANKA:44.1  Ryan Harris to Mathews, 1 run, low full toss on the legs, Mathews drills it with a straight bat to long onRyan Harris [4.0-0-31-0] is back into the attackLooks like Chandimal is getting a bit impatient, but Mathews has looked calm and steady.

SRI LANKA:43.6  Hilfenhaus to Mathews, 1 run, fuller length delivery on the off, Mathews drives it wide of mid off and retains strike with one

SRI LANKA:43.1  Hilfenhaus to Chandimal, FOUR, Chandimal on the attack straightaway! In the slot for him to free his arms and he does exactly that, puts a foot forward and heaves it over the vacant deep mid wicket region for an one bounce four, great start to the over10-1-35-1: Doherty ends a wonderful spell.
SRI LANKA:42.6  Doherty to Chandimal, 1 run, another risky run! Chandimal is living dangerously suddenly.. defends this to covers and starts off, the fielder swoops in and aims at the bowler's end but misses, Chandimal may have been a goner had he hit!
SRI LANKA:42.5  Doherty to Chandimal, 2 runs, risky shot and risky run! Chandimal decides to try the Dil-scoop now, and somehow manages to get it straight over the keeper's head, it was very close to short third man but he came charging back for the 2nd run, a better throw may have made it closer
SRI LANKA:42.4  Doherty to Chandimal, no run, slapped straight to the fielder! A bit of width outside off and Chandimal throws his bat at it, swats it straight to extra cover
SRI LANKA:42.3  Doherty to Chandimal, no run, lovely bowling, just like how he got Mahela eariler today. Slower and getting it to turn across after pitching, Chandimal was down the track but adjusted well to defend it

SRI LANKA:37.1  Brett Lee to Chandimal, no run, loose shot, not what you want from Chandimal especially after the wicket in the last over. This was banged in short but rising rapidly, Chandimal looks to slash it over the off side but doesn't have much width, ends up missing the ball
SRI LANKA:36.6  Christian to Mathews, no run, back of a length on the off, Mathews goes on the backfoot and blocks itAngelo Mathews, right handed bat, comes to the creaseDrinks are on the field now.
SRI LANKA:36.5  Christian to Thirimanne, out Caught by Hilfenhaus!! Uh oh, Thirimanne looks to be too cute and throws his wicket. Not a wicket taking delivery by any means - length ball down the leg side - Thirimanne shuffles across and looks to paddle it over short fine leg but ends up lobbing it straight to the man there.

Sri Lanka used a lot of slower ones early on to restrict the scoring, let's see if Australia tread a similar pathGood start and a good finish from Sri Lanka but it was all Australia in the middle. Wade and Warner failed, but Forrest, promoted to No. 3 and Clarke added 154 for the third wicket to put Australia in the box seat. Forrest has had an amazing start to his ODI career with 2 fifties and now a maiden ton in just 4 matches. The Husseys then took over and aided with a brief cameo from Lee helped Australia post a challenging score. Sri Lanka were agile to start with but withered away as the pressure grew. It has left them with a record chase on this ground. Join us at 18:35 local time ( 13:05 IST) for the chase.4

We have got a lot of variety in out bowling and so no harm in changing.Clarke: We're going to have a bat. The wicket looks outstanding. I'm feeling 100%. The leg is fine and I'm ready to go. We are looking forward to the 2015 World Cup. Shane Watson is our 12th man. It was great to make 280 odd in the Gabba and we hope we can do it again.Australia have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: The pitch is very flat. The grass on it is all dead reckons Tom Moody. He likens it to a road.Shane Watson is making a comeback into the Australian team after being sidelined by injury for close to three months. However, he may not feature in the match today, but we are waiting for official confirmation.Sri Lanka are on a roll after winning two consecutive matches. They comprehensively outclassed Australia at Sydney and defeated India at the Gabba to sit in second position in the points table. A win today for them will boost their chances of securing a place in the finals. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Welcome to the 9th match of the CB Series. This one takes place at the Blundstone Bellerive Oval in Hobart and it is the match between Australia and Sri Lanka. Australia are starting life without Ricky Ponting in the ODI setup and they will want to win today to seal their spot in the final.Preview by PradeepA new chapter will be written by Australia as they walk into the Blundstone Arena sans its favourite son, Ricky Ponting. A poor recent show with the bat ended Ricky's ODI career ironically just ahead of Australia's league match at his home ground. The Australians are up against the rampaging Sri Lankans who have found the winning formula just at the right time. A battle royale is certain between the two form teams as the tournament reaches the business end. A win for either team will place them closer towards a berth in the finals while a loss for Sri Lanka will enliven India's hopes.Australia: The hosts seemed to be surging ahead of its competitors before two successive losses held them back a bit. They found the winning formula again to beat India at the Gabba and head the table. The top-order batting has remained an area of concern for the hosts. David Warner has surprisingly struggled to adapt to the ODI form of the game. For an effective hitter of the ball, he has been found out whenever the bowlers change their angles and cramp him for room. Warner did show some of his ability against India at the Gabba and Australia will hope for more from their premium opener. The middle order has acquitted themselves very well with the Hussey brothers and Peter Forrest in charge while Daniel Christian has emerged as the finisher.Australia have an array of richness in the bowling department and the return of Ryan Harris strengthens the attack further. Ben Hilfenhaus continued to harass the Indians in the shorter format and marked his return to the ODI team after a span of more than 2 years with a 5-wicket haul. Clint McKay leads the bowling department with 9 scalps but may find it difficult to break into the already powerful bowling unit. Xavier Doherty has impressed all with his left arm spin, managing to keep the batsmen of the two Asian powerhouses quiet.Australia will be hoping that both their batting and bowling units click as they look to strengthen their position on the points table.Sri Lanka: After a slow start, Sri Lanka have hit top gear in superlative fashion. They crushed the hosts at Sydney with a bonus point before thrashing their sub-continental neighbours India at the Gabba. They have finally got the right batting order resulting in most of their successes. Mahela Jayawardene has been a revelation as a captain and his batting showed vast improvements at the top of the order. Dinesh Chandimal has been consistent in the middle order while Lahiru Thirimanne batted beautifully at the Gabba. Angelo Mathews has been a picture of consistency as a finisher while the likes of Thissara Perera and Fervez Maharoof have added stability and depth to the batting.Coming to Sri Lanka's bowling, Lasith Malinga has continued with his wicket taking form although being a touch expensive at times. Nuwan Kulasekara overcame a sluggish start to emerge as the side's best bowler in the last couple of matches. The all-rounders too have chipped in with useful contributions with the ball, making run-scoring difficult for the opposition. Rangana Herath has been very tidy with his left arm orthodox to round off a very good and balanced bowling attack.Mahela's inspired captaincy has seen Sri Lanka emerge stronger after a poor start and they will seek to continue their winning momentum.Team News: Shane Watson has made a comeback into the ODI squad after recovering from a hamstring injury sustained during the tour of South Africa. The chief of the National Selection Panel, John Inverarity has however hinted that Watson might not be risked for Friday's clash. In the absence of Ponting, Clarke is slated to bat at No.3 with Daniel Christian set to retain his place. Ryan Harris will be back at the expense of Mitchell Starc and Hilfenhaus's form will keep out Clint McKay.Sri Lanka have hit a purple patch in the last two matches and may go with an unchanged line-up once again.Quotes:It is tough not having the great Ricky Ponting out there this game playing one-day cricket for us but that's the decision we've made - Michael Clarke accepts that he had a role in Ricky Ponting's axing from the ODI squad.I have (spoken to him). I think there was a bit of fault in him as well. He's a young lad and I'm sure he'll learn from that. We've spoken, definitely - Mahela Jayawardene cautions young Thirimanne about backing up too far.
