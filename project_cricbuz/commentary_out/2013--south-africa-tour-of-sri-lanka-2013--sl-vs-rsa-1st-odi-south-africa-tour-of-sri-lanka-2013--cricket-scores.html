Colin Ingram b Malinga 0(1) Malinga to Colin Ingram, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Colin Ingram and Petersen are at the crease. Colin Ingram is on strike. Malinga will open the attackWhat a batting performance by Sri Lanka. They started off slowly but as the innings progressed, they got the momentum going in their way. It was all about Kumar Sangakkara. He scored his highest score in ODIs and also the 3rd highest score by a Sri Lankan in ODIs. The game was steady until 38 overs. But suddenly Sangakkara went berserk and ensured that Sri Lanka scored 34 runs in the last two overs of the batting powerplay. Ever since then, he found the boundaries at will and also picked up some lusty maximums. He shared a 123-run stand with Thirimanne in which he scored more than 100 runs. Sri Lanka now have a mammoth total to defend. AB de Villiers leans on the wicket to check its hardness. Do not go anywhere. Get back in a short while for an interesting South African reply.4

This is the first time South Africa is playing a series in Sri Lanka after 9 years. The hosts be boosted by the return of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Thisara Perera, who had missed the tri-series. Meanwhile, the tourists will be without the injured duo of Dale Steyn and Graeme Smith, and also Jacques Kallis.Preview:South Africa and Sri Lanka will be hoping to recover from recent setbacks in one-day cricket when they face off in a five-match series starting in Colombo on Saturday. Both teams were knocked out in the semi-final stage of the Champions Trophy despite being rated as two of the strongest contenders in the eight-nation tournament. The Proteas lived up to their reputation as "chokers", a tag outgoing coach Gary Kirsten said was fully justified following the semi-final defeat against England at the Oval in London. Sri Lanka, World Cup runners-up to India in 2011, fell to Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men twice in two weeks when the Champions Trophy defeat was followed by a loss in the tri-series final in the West Indies.Sri Lanka:Dinesh Chandimal, 23, will lead the Islanders in the first two matches against South Africa after regular captain Angelo Mathews was handed a two-match ban for his team's slow over-rates in the tri-series. Sri Lanka will miss frontline seamer Nuwan Kulasekara, who sustained a finger injury in the West Indies, for the first two games. Meanwhile, Jehan Mubarak, who was recalled after four years, lends experience to the Lankan middle order along with the seasoned pair of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. Sri Lanka will also be boosted by the return of Tillakaratne Dilshan and Thisara Perera, who had missed the tri-series. Uncapped middle-order batsman Angelo Perera, who can also turn his arm over, is considered a value addition to the side.Among the members named in the squad for the first two ODIs, Chandimal, Mubarak, Angelo Perera and Thisara Perera were also part of the Board President's XI team that took on South Africa in a practice game. Mubarak and Angelo came up with impressive forties while Chandimal got out after getting a start. Thisara failed in that game with the bat, but was performed decently with the ball, picking up two wickets. South Africa:The tourists will be without the injured duo of Dale Steyn and Graeme Smith, while veteran all-rounder Jacques Kallis prolonged a self-imposed break after sitting out the Champions Trophy. In further trouble for South Africa, fast bowlers Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe were doubtful for Saturday's match after picking up minor niggles at the start of the tour. The series is the first assignment for South Africa's new coach Russell Domingo, who served as Kirsten's deputy till the Champions Trophy. South African captain AB de Villiers had the condifence in the new coach, saying: "Russell communicates very well and he will make sure everyone understands their role really well."The Proteas warmed up for the series with a 73-run win over the Board President's XI in Colombo on Wednesday. JP Duminy hit form with 92 while Alviro Petersen, Faf du Plessis and the skipper spent some quality time at the middle, scoring useful forties. Amongst the bowlers, Chris Morris and Robin Peterson were the stand-out performers, claiming three wickets each while Aaron Phangiso and Duminy picked up two apiece.Numbers Game:1: The number of wickets Ajantha Mendis needs to become the 13th Sri Lankan with 100 or more wickets in One Day Internationals. Mendis will become the sixth Lankan spinner to scale that mark, in case he picks up a wicket in the opening ODI.1: AB de Villiers will attempt to become the first South African skipper to lead his side to a bilateral ODI series victory against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. South Africa, under Kepler Wessels, drew the series 1-1 in 1993 while the Graeme Smith-led team were white-washed 0-5 in 2004.51: South Africa's win percentage against Sri Lanka in One Day Internationals. They have played a total of 51 games, winning 25 and losing 24. One game was tied while one match yielded no result.Quotes:It's important for us to get combinations ready when we do lose our experienced players, specially looking at the 2015 World Cup. It's a great opportunity for us to perform without them: South Africa captain AB de Villiers reckons the absence of key players has given them an opportunity to test the youngsters.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Dinesh Chandimal(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Shaminda Eranga, Rangana Herath, Mahela Jayawardene, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Jehan Mubarak, Angelo Perera, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Upul TharangaSouth Africa (From): AB de Villiers(w/c), Hashim Amla, Farhaan Behardien, Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, Rory Kleinveldt, Ryan McLaren, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Alviro Petersen, Robin Peterson, Aaron Phangiso, Lonwabo TsotsobeLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
