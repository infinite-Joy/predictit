Porterfield is on strike. Iain Wardlaw will open the attackHello and welcome back to Ireland's chase. The target doesn't look too big but the Irish batsmen have to really play well in order to achieve the target. The pitch looked slow during the first innings and spinners will come into play in the middle overs. Scotland will be keen to pick some quick wickets as they are defending a low total. Let's see which side will have the last laugh. Stay tuned as we take you through Ireland's replyNot a big score but overall a decent end to Scotland's innings after they were reduced to 45/4 in 11 overs. Craig Young was fantastic in the initial overs as he picked up three out of the four wickets that fell. Luckily for Scotland, Matt Machan hung on and frustrated the Irish bowlers. He went on to score his third fifty-plus score and pushed them past the 200-mark. The Ireland bowlers, who looked threatening at the beginning, lost their focus in the middle overs. They were wayward in their line and lengths, bowling as many as 22 wides in the innings. Can their batsmen make up for the bowling errors? Join us in a short while to find out...4
