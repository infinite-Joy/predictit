Unless the Lankan bowlers can pull a rabbit out of the hat.A poor display of batting from Sri Lanka. Both openers played one shot too many, Chandimal poked and perished while Thirimanne flattered to deceive. Sangakkara and Tharanga put their heads down to add 96 runs to set up a platform for the later order. The batting PP was a disaster for Sri Lanka. They never came anywhere close to being able to read the doosra's from Ajmal and gifted away some wickets to Cheema. A splendid bowling performance from Pakistan has seen them stay on top at the half-way mark. Will SL fightback? Join us at 18:00 local time ( 17:30 IST) for the chase.4

SRI LANKA:5.1 Aizaz Cheema to Mahela Jayawardene, out Caught by Hafeez!! The commentator's curse working at the moment! I'm not so sure about how the Sri Lanka fans will react to that though, perhaps I should duck and take cover. It was a length ball outside the off stump. Mahela Jayawardene came down the track and tried to drive it hard on the up. Unfortunately though he drove it straight to Hafeez at cover who took a good catch to dismiss the opposing skipper. Mahela Jayawardene c Hafeez b Aizaz Cheema 12(15) [4s-1] Aizaz Cheema to Mahela Jayawardene, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Mahela has been very good at the opening position but that being said Tharanga hasn't been able to handle the middle order role very well. Especially when it comes to finishing the game. Should the Lankans think about a change in their strategy or can they afford to hang on to this tactic for sometime?

Umar Gul will open the attackAfter singing the national anthems of their respective countries, the players are ready for the start of the matchTeams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Nasir Jamshed, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Hammad Azam, Shahid Afridi, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Aizaz CheemaSri Lanka (Playing XI): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Upul Tharanga, Farveez Maharoof, Nuwan Kulasekara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Lasith Malinga, Suranga LakmalMisbah: We also wanted to bat first because we have a good bowling attack that can defend a score. We have added Hammad Azam to give us a little more of an option in the medium pace department. It is a challenge for us to pick up our batting today. There is less pressure on us right now because Sri Lanka are in a must win situation so it gives us a good chance to go out there and win this game.Mahela: I think the wicket has been used earlier so we will bat first. We want to get the runs on the board. It is an open tournament, India are yet to play Pakistan as well. We want to just open up and play some good cricket. I think we needed to make sure that Lasith gets some rest after the CB series but he is back for this match.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: The pitch looks like an absolute beauty. Nothing on it to cause any worry for the batsmen. It looks like an even surface and the ball will come on to the bat easily. Chasing has been tough on this wicket and Sunil Gavaskar believes that the side that wins the toss will elect to bat first. So it is a pitch then that should have a lot of runs on offer.It is a big day for Sri Lanka. A win will keep their hopes alive while a loss will all but ensure their exit from the tournament. Mahela & co. have been used to such situations in Australia and they will be confident about their chances. Pakistan are their opponents today and a win for them will all but seal their spot in the finals. Hello, and a warm welcome to one and all to Match 3 of the Asia Cup. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates..Each and every game is an important one in the Asia Cup as the tournament in itself is a very short one. One loss could end or diminish the fortunes of a team, and that's exactly why it makes the clash between Pakistan and Sri Lanka a virtual knock out game for the latter. Pakistan overcame a spirited Bangladesh team in their opener, while Sri Lanka lost to India in their first game. Siddharth Prabhakar (supporing Sri Lanka) and Vishaal (supporting Pakistan) reason out why they believe their team will win. Sid P: Although Pakistan's Test record in the recent past is impeccable, the ODI squad has looked wobbly. A 4-0 thrashing against an England side which lost 5-0 to India on sub-continent wickets is not exactly the sign of a good ODI squad. Do u still feel that they will be able to match up to the Lankans who probably are the best ODI team in the world right now? Vishaal: Firstly, Sri Lanka is not the best ODI team in the world right now, I'd give the Aussies that position. The England result was just a minor blip in what has otherwise been an impressive season for the Men in Green but they've had a solid start to the Asia Cup and I'm confident that they will carry on and more or less seal their spot in the finals. Sid P: The Pakistan side seems to be over-dependent on a few players like M Hafeez, Umar Gul and Ajmal. Players like skipper Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan have not risen to the occasion in the past few ODIs. Vishaal: Misbah ul Haq and Younis Khan add some much needed steel and experience to the batting line up. They may have not been at their best in recent games, but I'm certain that they come back strong sooner rather than later. Hafeez, Gul and Ajmal are Pakistan's key players and its natural that fans expect them to be at their best almost always. I wouldn't call it over-dependence, over-dependence is how SL's bowling always revolve around Malinga and his failure affects the entire team. Sid P: Last question, the main question regarding any Pakistan ODI squad will be Shahid Afridi. Of late he has played well against England in the ODIs and T20s. But considering that he is nearing 7000 runs, shouldn't he be shouldering more responsibility in a fragile middle order? Vishaal: Shahid Afridi's effect with the bat may have waned, but on his day he can still be devastating. He is a hit-or-miss type of player and one can't really ask him to change his batting style now. More consistent shows with the bat will be perfect, yes! But with him doing so much damage with the the ball, I wouldn't be complaining much about him. He will remain an asset and a match winner even when he doesn't do much while batting. Vishaal: A lot of people were reckoning that Sri Lanka were comfortable favourites to win the series after their impressive showing in the CB series. On the back of a 50 run walloping at the hands of India and with much of the team looking in complete disarray, how would you rate Sri Lanka's chances in the series now? Sid P: One cannot decide the fate of a team just on the basis of one result. In the very same CB series that you mentioned, Sri Lanka were by far the most consistent team. Despite several injuries towards the end of the series, they put up a brilliant show. Like India skipper MS Dhoni said, defending in Dhaka can be a bit difficult, but with players like Chandimal, Jayawardene and Dilshan, Sri Lanka will surely make an impact in the next games. Vishaal: Sri Lanka's performance in the first ODI showed how much they depend on Malinga and Mathews. In his absence, the Lankan bowlers were woefully off the radar. Attempted yorkers were all over the place and easy full tosses were on offer far too often. With Malinga's availabilty still in doubt and Mathews ruled out, how much of a blow will it be to Sri Lanka's confidence and chances if Malinga sits out again. Sid P: First things first, Mathews was not in the side which ran Australia close in the best of 3 finals in the CB series. Though Nuwan Kulasekara cannot be classified as complete an all-rounder as Mathews, he is no mug with the bat. Moreover, Farvez Maharoof struck a few lusty blows towards the end against India and he has a proven ability to relish pressure situations. As far as the bowling is concerned, the problem with full-tosses and attempted yorkers will be looked at by the bowling coach and corrected in the next games. In any case, Malinga's absence will be felt. Vishaal: Against a lack-lustre Indian attack, the Sri Lankan batters struggled. How tough would it be against the likes of Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi and who would you say is the main threat for the Lankan side. Sid P: The Indian bowlers might have had a bad summer down under, but in sub-continent conditions, they are a force to reckon with. To give them due, the Lankan batsmen did put up a brave fight in difficult conditions. As far as the Pakistan attack is concerned, the batsmen are more than equipped to deal with them. Even if our batsmen make any mistakes, the generous Pakistan fielders are sure to give them a few extra chances as has happened in the past. Rather than Ajmal, Afridi or Gul, I feel that Hafeez, with his tight bowling and solid batting will be the biggest threat for Sri Lanka. Vishaal: Even though his numbers tell a different story, Tharanga at number 6 has been a bit of a liability as he has been unable to finish games for Lanka. Would it not be better for the Lankans to have a finisher and a big hitter at that position instead of a specialist opener? Sid P: In a side which has all-rounders like Dilshan and Maharoof, having a solid and orthodox batsman like Tharanga at number 6 provides the young middle order with a good balance. Knowing that Tharanga is still to come, young guns like Thirimanne and Chandimal can play their strokes freely. With his experience of batting at the top of the order, Tharanga might be a force to reckon with in the batting powerplay which is usually taken during the 30-40 over mark. Vishaal: I still think he'd be more effective at the top. Anyway, best of luck. Sid P: See you at the game.
