IRELAND:18.5 18.5 Aftab Alam to Poynter, FOUR, Ireland are champions! they have got their revenge for their loss in the last edition to the same opponents. Low full toss on the stumps, flicked away to deep mid wicket and as soon as the winning hit was done, Poynter and Andrew White pumped their fists and indulged in some extravagant celebrations
IRELAND:18.4  Aftab Alam to Poynter, no run, short one on the stumps, Poynter defends it watchfully
IRELAND:18.3 Aftab Alam to Andrew White, 1 run, full on leg stump, whipped to deep square leg. Scores level now
IRELAND:18.2  Aftab Alam to Poynter, 1 run, flicked to deep square legAndrew White, right handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:18.1  Aftab Alam to Gary Wilson, out Caught by Mirwais Ashraf!! Gary Wilson went for the big hit to win the game and holed out. Full on off, sliced straight to the fielder at long off. Aftab Alam sends Gary Wilson on his way with a lot of expletives and arms waving. Wilson responds in kind as well. Not good to see. Bad behaviour from both the bowler and the batsman. Gary Wilson c Mirwais Ashraf b Aftab Alam 32(39) [4s-2] Aftab Alam to Gary Wilson, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
IRELAND:17.6 Naib to Gary Wilson, 1 run, comes down the track and turns it to short fine leg, retains the strike with that run
IRELAND:17.5 Naib to Poynter, 1 run, keeps a bit low, Poynter pulls to deep backward square for a single

IRELAND:17.1 Naib to Gary Wilson, 2 runs, flicks it to deep mid wicket for a coupleGulbodin Naib is into the attack
IRELAND:16.6  Aftab Alam to Gary Wilson, 1 run, a bit of an issue there as Aftab Alam stretched his left arm out when Gary Wilson was running through. The batsman isn't happy and the umpire steps in to settle the issue. Lots of heated moments there. Would've been close had the fielder hit as well
IRELAND:16.5  Aftab Alam to Gary Wilson, 2 runs, another fumble by Shenwari at point, dives to his right to save and makes a half stop. Another couple
IRELAND:16.4  Aftab Alam to Poynter, 1 run, full on the stumps, Poynter inside edges the big hit to short fine
IRELAND:16.3  Aftab Alam to Poynter, 2 runs, now a misfield by Shenwari at point allows a couple. It was straight to him and he fumbled and allowed to go through
IRELAND:16.2  Aftab Alam to Poynter, 2 runs, flicked to mid wicket, there is a shy at the bowlers end, it hits the umpire and deflects away, they take another run
IRELAND:16.1  Aftab Alam to Poynter, no run, driven to cover, straight to the fielderAftab Alam [2.0-0-20-1] is back into the attack
IRELAND:15.6  Dawlatzai to Poynter, 1 run, driven wide of mid off who makes a sprawling stop. Saved 3 runs
IRELAND:15.5  Dawlatzai to Poynter, SIX, Blast! That could well be the decisive blow. Poynter makes room and then frees his arms, before flat batting it over long off. That shot had so much power that it went all the way. Clean clean hitting and Poynter likes it
IRELAND:15.4  Dawlatzai to Poynter, no run, short delivery on the stumps, Poynter pulls and mistimes it to mid wicket. Too late on the shot
IRELAND:15.3  Dawlatzai to Gary Wilson, 1 run, driven to long off
IRELAND:15.2  Dawlatzai to Gary Wilson, FOUR, gosh! what timing on that. Just pure timing. Using the pace of Dawlatzai to great effect. Steered it wide of point and beat a desperate dive from Zadran running across from third man. Porterfield likes it and applauds though with a grim faced expression
IRELAND:15.1  Dawlatzai to Gary Wilson, no run, back of a length on off, Gary Wilson gets forward and defends compactly
IRELAND:14.6  D Zadran to Gary Wilson, 1 run, low full toss on the stumps, bunted to long on and that's the end of D Zadran for this tournament and what a tournament he has had. Watch out for this fella at the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka

IRELAND:14.4  D Zadran to Poynter, no run, tries to repeat the shot and doesn't time it at all, goes to cover, straight to the fielder
IRELAND:14.3  D Zadran to Poynter, FOUR, audacious shot. Backs away and carves it over cover. Didn't time it well, but well enough to get a boundary. Pressure releasing boundary that
IRELAND:14.2  D Zadran to Gary Wilson, 1 run, pushes it to mid on and scampers through for a quick single
IRELAND:14.1  D Zadran to Gary Wilson, no run, no he can't! But nearly did. Goes for the short delivery, Gary Wilson was trying to glide it towards third man and then backed out. D Zadran's follow-through is elongated and has a stare at the batsman. Great fast bowling from D ZadranRight Zadran on a hat-trick now. He is setting the field. Will he get it?
IRELAND:13.6  Dawlatzai to Poynter, no run, loose shot from Poynter, skips out and tries to slash it away, misses. Another pacy delivery from Dawlatzai. Really impressive
IRELAND:13.5  Dawlatzai to Poynter, no run, back of a length on off, Poynter defends it back to Dawlatzai
IRELAND:13.4  Dawlatzai to Poynter, no run, serious pace from Dawlatzai now. Strikes Poynter on the helmet with a pacy delivery, he was looking to duck and it strikes him on the badge. Mangal was in play aiming to go for the catch, but it eludes him at mid wicket. No bat there and they didn't even run. Strange. But really good attacking fast bowling from Dawlatzai
IRELAND:13.3  Dawlatzai to Gary Wilson, 1 run, full on off, Gary Wilson gets forward and drives to long off
IRELAND:13.2  Dawlatzai to Gary Wilson, FOUR, short one on the body, Gary Wilson gets inside the kine, swivels and pulls it past short fine inside the ring, beautifully played

IRELAND:12.6  D Zadran to Kevin O'Brien, out Caught by Mohammad Shahzad!! Now the game will get interesting. D Zadran on a hat-trick. Loose shot from Kevin O'Brien, fishing away from the body to a length ball outside off and edging it. A good take by a tired Shahzad. The crowd go wild again. What a move to bring back D Zadran by Mangal. Kevin O'Brien c Mohammad Shahzad b D Zadran 0(1) D Zadran to Kevin O'Brien, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Kevin O'Brien, right handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:12.5  D Zadran to Stirling, out Caught by G Naib!! D Zadran strikes and credit to Naib. It was heading over his head at deep square, he went to his left and hauled it back in with two hands. That is a seriously good catch. Stirling pulled it well and can't believe that he has found the man. Is there a twist in the tale? Stirling c G Naib b D Zadran 79(38) [4s-9 6s-3] D Zadran to Stirling, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Stirling is gone. OUT! Not sure who the fielder is. Waiting to confirm and it is Naib.

IRELAND:12.2  D Zadran to Stirling, 1 run, slinging delivery, but equally well played by Stirling who drives it uppishly to long offSlight delay in play as the ball is getting changed. The players take a drink. Everything seems to be sorted now. Back for more action.
IRELAND:12.1  D Zadran to Stirling, FOUR, swatted away! Utter disdain in that shot. Straight back over the bowlers head. Now there is a discussion between the bowler and the captainDawlat Zadran [2.0-0-8-1] is back into the attack
IRELAND:11.6  Nabi to Gary Wilson, no run, skips down and pushes it back to the bowler
IRELAND:11.5  Nabi to Gary Wilson, 2 runs, makes room and tries to go inside out over cover, the ball falls in no-mans land. Safe for a couple

IRELAND:10.1  Shenwari to Gary Wilson, 1 run, turns it to deep square le
IRELAND:9.6  Nabi to Gary Wilson, 1 run, what a great decision from the ump. There was a call for a run-out, but he was in the right position and made the right decision.

IRELAND:9.5  Nabi to Stirling, 1 run, short outside off, cut to deep backward point
IRELAND:9.4  Nabi to Stirling, 2 runs, cuts it down to third man
IRELAND:9.3  Nabi to Stirling, 2 runs, Dropped! What a bad effort from the fielder. Stirling comes down the track and flicks, gets a leading edge, the fielder comes in, gets both hands to it and lets it slip through his hands. The bowler isn't impressed at all
IRELAND:9.2  Nabi to Gary Wilson, leg byes, 1 run, tries to reverse sweep and gets bottom edge on it

IRELAND:7.2  Nabi to Stirling, no run, gets back to defence now

IRELAND:6.2  Aftab Alam to Stirling, 1 run, 17 ball 50 for Stirling and that is the 2nd fastest T20I fifty ever. Only Yuvraj Singh ahead of him in that list. Gets there with a flick to deep square. A wonderful exhibition of power hitting this
IRELAND:6.1  Aftab Alam to Stirling, SIX, can't bowl short to this fella. Sits up to be hit and Stirling dismisses it with a frontfoot pull over deep mid. The ball clattering into the seatsAftab Alam [1.0-0-8-1] is back into the attack
IRELAND:5.6  Shenwari to Stirling, 1 run, softly played to mid on, retains the strike with that run
IRELAND:5.5  Shenwari to Stirling, 2 runs, jams his bat down on the full one on the stumps, past cover and deep cover cuts it off - still a couple
IRELAND:5.4  Shenwari to Stirling, FOUR, that's a risky shot, but Stirling executed it well, kneels down to sweep a low full toss on middle and connects, sending it past short fine inside the ring
IRELAND:5.3  Shenwari to Gary Wilson, 1 run, comes down the track and drills it to mid on
IRELAND:5.2  Shenwari to Gary Wilson, no run, driven to cover, straight to the fielder
IRELAND:5.1  Shenwari to Gary Wilson, no run, big appeal for caught behind, but no edge on that after Gary Wilson missed the cover driveSamiullah Shenwari, right-arm leg break, comes into the attack
IRELAND:4.6  Dawlatzai to Stirling, SIX, brilliant batting. Width outside off, Stirling bent low and opens the face of the bat to slice it high and so high that it went all the way over third man. The pace of Dawlatzai proving to be his undoing. Costly over for Afghanistan
IRELAND:4.5  Dawlatzai to Stirling, no run, tries to repeat the stroke and finds point, no timing on that shot
IRELAND:4.4  Dawlatzai to Stirling, FOUR, that's a great shot. Backed away and lifted it up and over the infield on the off side. Since we are in the powerplay, it always was a boundary
IRELAND:4.3  Dawlatzai to Stirling, 2 runs, doesn't get hold of this and lots of height rather than distance, falls safely at wide long on
IRELAND:4.2  Dawlatzai to Stirling, FOUR, nearly another caught and bowled. Stirling flat batted it past the right hand of Dawlatzai who didn't have time to react. It went to the long off fence in a jiffy. More frustration for Dawlatzai. Stirling getting lucky again
IRELAND:4.1  Dawlatzai to Gary Wilson, leg byes, 1 run, ooh! that looked close. Pitches and nips back in sharply, catches Gary Wilson on the back leg in front of off, Dawlatzai was sure that he had his man, but the umpire negated the appeal straight-away, that really looked close. If there was no bat, I cant see how that was missing anything. Dawlatzai isn't a happy manIzatullah Dawlatzai, right-arm medium, comes into the attack
IRELAND:3.6  Aftab Alam to Stirling, FOUR, short outside off, pulled away to deep mid, beating the fielder easily who dived in vain. Stirling continues on his merry ways
IRELAND:3.5  Aftab Alam to Stirling, no run, a huge appeal for an LBW, but that was sliding down leg, looked too high as wellGary Wilson, right handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:3.4  Aftab Alam to Ed Joyce, out Caught by Nabi!! 2nd wicket for Afghanistan. Ed Joyce skipped down the track and flicked it in the air where deep square moves to his right to take a simple catch. Aftab Alam strikes in his opening over. Ed Joyce c Nabi b Aftab Alam 11(16) [4s-2] Aftab Alam to Ed Joyce, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
IRELAND:3.3  Aftab Alam to Ed Joyce, no run, driven to cover, straight to the fielder
IRELAND:3.2  Aftab Alam to Ed Joyce, no run, nearly a c&b. Ed Joyce into the chip shot early and it went tantalisingly close to the right of Aftab Alam who didn't even get a hand to it. Nervy moment for Ed Joyce
IRELAND:3.1  Aftab Alam to Ed Joyce, FOUR, superb stroke. That's Michael Husseyesque almost from Ed Joyce. Leans out to an overpitched ball outside off and drives beautifully through cover. That's how you play the cover drive.Aftab Alam, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
IRELAND:2.6  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, 1 run, retains the strike with that run to deep square
IRELAND:2.6  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, wide, short quick bouncer and Ed Joyce gets under it quickly. Wide called for height
IRELAND:2.5  D Zadran to Stirling, 1 run, full and on the stumps, whipped airily and it just falls short of mid on. There was a chance of a run-out as well, but the fielder didn't hit direct at D Zadran's end. Stirling very lucky to survive there.
IRELAND:2.4  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, 1 run, much better as he sensibly plays it to mid on and turns the strike over
IRELAND:2.3  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, no run, bad batting and that is due to some great bowling as well. Ed Joyce backs away and tries to go over cover, misses. Beaten 3 times in a row now
IRELAND:2.2  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, no run, ripper! This fella has some serious talent. Pitches outside off and it straightens and beats Ed Joyce on the outside edge. Ed Joyce was trying to push half-heartedly and is lucky that he didn't edge it. The keeper was convinced that Ed Joyce had nicked it, but there was no edge
IRELAND:2.1  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, no run, changes the angle to round the wicket and beats Ed Joyce with a beauty. Ed Joyce got forward to drive and the ball whizzed past the edge
IRELAND:1.6  Mirwais Ashraf to Ed Joyce, 1 run, defended to cover point, an easy single is taken
IRELAND:1.5  Mirwais Ashraf to Ed Joyce, no run, flicked to mid wicket
IRELAND:1.5  Mirwais Ashraf to Ed Joyce, wide, slides down leg
IRELAND:1.4  Mirwais Ashraf to Stirling, 3 runs, flicked through mid wicket, it doesn't have the legs to carry all the way. A three and Mirwais Ashraf will be a tad relieved that Stirling is off strike
IRELAND:1.3  Mirwais Ashraf to Stirling, FOUR, the chat hasn't worked. Stirling gets his third boundary in a row by dancing down the wicket and carving it square of the wicket. Sliced it well and Ireland are counter-punching with style
IRELAND:1.2  Mirwais Ashraf to Stirling, FOUR, 2 in 2. Stirling moves across to off and then nonchalantly whips it over backward square, nearly a six, an one bounce over the ropes boundary in the end. Mirwais Ashraf and Mangal have a chat
IRELAND:1.1  Mirwais Ashraf to Stirling, FOUR, Stirling is just continuing from where he left off against Namibia. Overpitched outside off, Stirling gets forward and drives crisply through cover. Lovely way to get off the markMirwais Ashraf, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
IRELAND:0.6  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, FOUR, stylish looking pull shot. One leg up in the air - almost BCL like, though the ball seemed like it would stop before reaching the ropes, it crossed it eventually. That's why Ed Joyce is such a fine player and played for England too
IRELAND:0.5  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, no run, punched off the backfoot to point
IRELAND:0.4  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, no run, full on off, Ed Joyce gets forward to drive to cover
IRELAND:0.3  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, leg byes, FOUR, Shahzad did poorly there. Should've stopped that. Catches a bit of pad on the way and Shahzad didn't dive at all - it was just the perfect diving stop for him and Ireland are away
IRELAND:0.2  D Zadran to Ed Joyce, no run, now follows up the last ball with an away swinger, to which Ed Joyce prods uncertainly and nearly edges it. Followed the angle and was lucky that it didn't kiss the edgeEd Joyce, left handed bat, comes to the crease
IRELAND:0.1  D Zadran to Porterfield, out Bowled!! D Zadran you hero! What a man! That would've made Waqar Younis proud. Slinging inswinger that pitches on off and curves back in to hit middle after Porterfield aimed for an ambitious punch through the off side. Big gap between bat and pad which D Zadran found to a nicety. He took a wicket off his first ball in the last game and he has repeated it again. The crowd go mad. The middle stump is flattened. What a sight for a fast bowler. Dream start for Afghanistan. Porterfield b D Zadran 0(1) D Zadran to Porterfield, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Porterfield and Stirling are at the crease. Porterfield is on strike. D Zadran will open the attackIn the end a pretty strong finish by Afghanistan. Great effort from Shahzad - he played through with pain after colliding with Johnston and batted superbly. Quite a few of his shots bore a stamp of class. The others played around him and though 152 doesn't seem a big score against an experienced Irish side, Afghanistan do have a chance with their strong bowling line-up. They have the runs on the board and in a final that always counts. We will be back shortly for the chase.1
AFGHANISTAN:19.6  Trent Johnston to G Naib, SIX, 1st ball of the innings was a six over long on. The last ball had to go there. It was destined to happen. Too full on the stumps, G Naib gets under it and clatters it over long on. No chance for the man there. Strong finish by G Naib and that has spoiled what was a brilliant last over by Trent Johnston until then. G Naib and Aftab Alam run off to get ready to bowl
AFGHANISTAN:19.5  Trent Johnston to G Naib, SIX, Trent Johnston becomes too predictable and pays the price. G Naib picks the slower delivery and lofts it beautifully with a lot of timing over long on. Really caught it sweetly
