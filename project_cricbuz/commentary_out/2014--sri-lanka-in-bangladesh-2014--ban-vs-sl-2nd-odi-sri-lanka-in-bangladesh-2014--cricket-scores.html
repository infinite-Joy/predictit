Malinga will open the attackThe Sri Lankan's stride out to the middle followed by the openers. Anamul is taking guard and Malinga to open the attack.Welcome back for Bangladesh's reply. Sanga produced another masterclass while Mathews applied the finishing touches as Sri Lanka posted a formidable total. With the series on the line, can Bangladesh's batsmen step up and deliver?The Bangladeshi bowling was once again led by the spinners, who were economical and didn't give away much in the middle overs. The bowlers were not supported well in the field as there were around 5 catches that were put down. The batters have their task cut out, chasing around 300 under lights is never going to be easy. They will have to somehow manage to pull this off if they have to level the series. Join us back in a few minutes for the run chase.....Sri Lanka have done well to put up a competitive total on the board. They did not get off to the best of starts as they lost three quick wickets when the score was just 62. Sangakkara and Priyanjan steadied the innings with a solid 114-run stand.
