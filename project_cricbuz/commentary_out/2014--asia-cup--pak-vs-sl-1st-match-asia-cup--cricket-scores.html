Gul gave them good support as he picked up two. Pakistan have never chased 250 plus in an ODI since March 2011. So they have their backs against the wall. Will they be able to get this total or will they falter? Join us in a short while to find out.....Pakistan have made an excellent recovery. At one stage, Sri Lanka were well on course for a score around 320-330. Perera went early as he nicked one off Gul. After that it was the Thirimanne and Sangakkara show, as the were invloved in a record 2nd wicket partnership. Thirimanne took his time at the start, but came into his own as the innings progressed.
