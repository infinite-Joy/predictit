Jason Roy is on strike. Ben Wheeler will open the attackWelcome back for the run chase. The players are making their way out to the middle. Wheeler to open the attack with one slip. He also has a catching fielder at short mid-wicketHowever, once Taylor was dismissed by Finn, they lost the plot. For a brief period, Elliott struggled to keep the scorecard ticking and that didn't help their cause. To his credit, Elliott didn't press the panic button and upped the ante by smacking Willey for 17 runs in the 46th over. Mitchell Santner too landed hefty blows in the 48th over bowled by Adil Rashid, thwacking him for four sixes. Wood was clearly England's best bowler. He kept it tight and rarely offered width for the opposition batsmen to free their arms. Finn supported him well. Willey was expensive, but made key breakthroughs. The deck is flat, and England still have a glimmer of a chance of overhauling the target and level the series 2-2.On the back of a superlative knock by Kane Williamson and Grant Elliott's timely contribution, the visitors reached a massive total. The able pace duo of Steven Finn and Mark Wood though, by mainly looking to hit back of a length and occasionally mixing it up with slower ones, were able to stem the run flow to some extent. Earlier, after Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill essayed handy knocks at the top of the order, Williamson and Ross Taylor stitched a crucial century stand for the third wicket to put New Zealand in the ascendancy.4

We are all set for the action to begin. David Willey to open proceedings with one slip.Weather: Currently it's a little cloudy out there, with chances of a few showers later in the day. Hopefully, the rain will stay away and we will get a full game in.Teams:England (Playing XI): Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(w), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Mark Wood, Steven FinnNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi(w), Ben Wheeler, Matt Henry, Tim Southee, Mitchell McClenaghanMorgan: 'We would have batted first as well. We want to continue with the way we have batted. We want to improve with the ball. We let ourselves down in the field in the last game. Hopefully, we can put that behind us in this game. There are no restrictions or limitations on any player, they just need to go out there and execute their skills. We thought about the two twins (Craig and Jamie Overton), but we felt that the balance is right with the same team.'McCullum: 'We are going to bat first. It looks a good deck and we will look to put a good score on the board. We want to win the series today and if we can't, we will try and do that in the next game. This English side has been playing really well. It's a big challenge for us against this team and the boys are excited. We have an unchanged team. People have had a good time being part of this team and everyone is enjoying their role.'New Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batOn the other hand, New Zealand too have problems of their own. They lost Corey Anderson to a back injury earlier and now, Trent Boult too has been ruled out for the rest of the series due to a back injury as well. The Black Caps though will be happy with the performance of Ben Wheeler, who made his debut in Boult's absence. Wheeler, a left-armer himself, shared the new ball with Southee in the last game and managed to pick 3 English wickets.After Craig Overton was drafted into the squad in place of injured Chris Jordan, the ECB have also named his twin brother, Jamie Overton, as a replacement for Liam Plunkett for the remaining two ODIs. Plunkett has been ruled out of the series after straining his calf during the rain-affected 2nd ODI. If selected, Craig and Jamie Overton will become the first twins to play for England.The pitches throughout this series have been flat and have offered very little assistance to the bowlers. It will be interesting to see if the pitch at Trent Bridge has something for the bowlers. We've had three high-scoring games so far and it won't come as a surprise if the pitch turns out to be batting-friendly.Hello and welcome to the fourth ODI between England and New Zealand. The hosts were looking extremely good to post a big total around 350 when Ben Stokes and Sam Billings were going great guns, but a lower-order collapse saw England being bundled out for 302. In fact, they lost their last 5 wickets for a paltry 14 runs.A 206-run record stand between Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor saw New Zealand take a 2-1 lead in the last match. Even though the Kiwis lost a few quick wickets towards the end, the bowlers made sure that they finish the job for the team. As it turned out, Tim Southee hit the winning runs, helping New Zealand overhaul their target of 303, their highest successful run-chase away from home.Preview:One 400+ total, four 300+ totals, a new-look England side finally catching up with the changing times in limited-overs cricket and New Zealand with a 2-1 lead - this is the story so far in the ODI series between England and New Zealand, with the visitors coming back well to post back-to-back victories after losing the first ODI by a big margin. The Black Caps will be eager to come up with a clinical performance at Trent Bridge to clinch the series while England will be eager to prevent them from taking an unassailable 3-1 lead.Eoin Morgan has led well from the front with three half-centuries on the trot while Joe Root, Jos Buttler, Alex Hales and Ben Stokes have also contributed with the bat. This is a welcome change for England, who appeared decades away from coming to terms with the modern game during their dismal 2015 World Cup campaign. Whenever the top-order batsmen have failed in this series, England have made sure not to throw in the towel, taking the fight back to the opposition. The batting order has impressed a lot, although England's tendency to lose wickets in a heap - as seen in the previous ODI is still something that needs to be addressed.As far as the England bowlers are concerned, they have not been able to do much on pitches that are heavily in favour of the batsmen. However, England will prefer that the bowlers are more disciplined and use the variations to good effect to restrict the power-packed New Zealand batting line-up.Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor have been in superb form in the ODI series and have done the bulk of the scoring for New Zealand in this series. Taylor has a half-century and two hundreds against his name in the three matches so far while Williamson narrowly missed out on a fifty and a ton in the first two games before notching up his seventh ODI century at The Rose Bowl. Their form augurs well for the visitors, who will be hoping that the rest of the batsmen join the party soon. Skipper Brendon McCullum has failed to get going at the top of the order while Martin Guptill, apart from a fifty in the second ODI, has not done much. The lower middle-order batsmen have also not been at their best so far in the series and the Black Caps will be hoping that this changes soon.In the bowling department, Trent Boult has been the pick of the bowlers, but New Zealand no longer have the luxury of banking on the left-arm quick as he has been ruled out of the series with an injury. Tim Southee, who showed a lot of improvement in the third ODI after going for aplenty in the second, will have to lead the attack in Boult's absence. New Zealand will also expect the likes of Mitchell McClenaghan, Ben Wheeler - who was impressive in his debut match in Southampton - and the spinners to hit the right areas.Match Date: 17th June 2015Time: 13:00 GMT (18:30 IST)Venue: Trent Bridge, NottinghamWeather: Partly cloudy with a high of 19 degree CelsiusTeam News:England:Injuries to Chris Jordan and Liam Plunkett have given England an opportunity to field their first pair of twins in international cricket, with the inclusion of Craig and Jamie Overton in the squad. However, the twin brothers may have to wait longer to find a place in the eleven, considering that David Willey and Mark Wood did a decent job in the previous match. England are likely to go in with the same eleven, although there is an outside chance of a historic moment in English cricket.Probable XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler (wk), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Mark Wood, Steven FinnNew Zealand:Stress-related injuries to the back for Corey Anderson and Boult have been setbacks for the visitors, who had to bring in left-arm seamer Wheeler as a replacement for the latter for the third ODI. He is expected to retain his place, so should Matt Henry, who did a decent job after replacing an expensive Nathan McCullum. New Zealand are likely to stick to the same eleven that took the field for the third ODI.Probable XI: Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum (c), Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi (wk), Ben Wheeler, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghanNumbers:36: The number of runs Joe Root requires to reach 2000 runs in ODI cricket. He is set to become the fifth fastest England cricketer to 2000 ODI runs.48 and 51: The number of runs Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor require respectively to become the first New Zealand players to register 1000 runs against England in ODIs.Quotes:"We have set very high standards for us now.
