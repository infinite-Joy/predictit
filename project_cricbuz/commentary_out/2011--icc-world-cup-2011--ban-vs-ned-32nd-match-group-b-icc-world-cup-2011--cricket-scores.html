Bukhari will open the attackWelcome back to the Bangladesh chase. It should be a relatively easy task ahead for their batsmen and it will be interesting to see their approach considering the fact that they need to improve their Net Run Rate.On a pitch that was expected to help the bowlers, the decision of the Netherlands to bat first was a strange one. Shafiul started off with two maidens and the openers struggled to get going. Szwarczynski struggled a lot and the pressure mounted. Shakib sent back Barresi and the squeeze was on. The Bangladeshi fielding was sharp as they effected four run-outs. None of the Dutch batsmen managed to negotiate the spinners confidently. Doeschate held on but he could not get any support. Netherlands have folded up for a paltry 160 and Bangladesh will be favorites to chase this down. Join us in a short while for the chase.4

A victory today, they may well envision hopes of another upset in the next match and book their place in the quarter finals. A defeat, and they will be left praying for a miracle in the next few games.

The guys are very relaxed and hopefully we will perform well. Shuvo and Nafees replace Raqibul and Naeem Islam.Borren: We were sloppy with the bat against India and we need to step up. Buurman and Raja come into the team.Netherlands have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: There is a fair bit of moisture on this pitch. The seamers will get a lot of help and it will also assist the spinners. The pitch will dry up soon and it will be easier to bat on.Hello and Welcome to the match between Bangladesh and the Netherlands in Chittagong. This is a very important game for the Tigers as a win here would keep them in the hunt for a quarter-final position. However, the Dutch will be looking to go out on a high and spoil the party for the Bangladeshis. It promises to be a very exciting match in prospect.Preview by Saurabh SomaniAt the start of the World Cup, the Bangladesh-Netherlands match wouldn't have had too many people excited about it, except for the fans of either country. However, with Group B throwing up one unexpected result after the other, this match has suddenly assumed great importance, not just for the teams involved but also for those whose fate depends on the result today. England for one, will be most interested spectators for this match, since a Bangladesh victory would see England slipping below them in the points table.Bangladesh: Their victory against England was among the greatest in their relatively short history, and given the manner in which it was achieved, also among the most historically significant. Bangladesh have displayed some up-and-down form in the tournament so far though, and they must be wary of inconsistency striking them in this match.
Their top-order batting has a completely altered look when Tamim Iqbal fires, and it will be essential for him to do so again. Amongst the bowlers, Shafiul Islam has been great, but Bangladesh will be expected to prepare their traditional spin-friendly pitches and deploy their spinners effectively. Shakib al Hasan has done a commendable job in bringing his team together in the aftermath of the West Indies win, and he has led from the front on the field as well. He will now have to ensure that the team's feet stay grounded, for what is a must-win match in Bangladesh's quest for a quarter-final spot.Netherlands: They pulled the short straw when the schedule for the World Cup was announced, having to face England, South Africa, India and the West Indies as their first four teams. They have shown great spirit even though they have lost each of their matches - enough to be considered a genuine threat against the relatively less experienced Bangladesh and Ireland sides. Nothing exemplified that spirit better than Pieter Seelar's unbounded joy at getting Sachin Tendulkar out at Delhi.
After his first match heroics, Ryan ten Doeschate has not lived up to his status as the best cricketer amongst Associate nations, and this is the best platform for him to do that. Netherlands will not be satisfied with merely making up the numbers in Group B, and will be fiercely targeting a victory here.Group Dynamics:Bangladesh have two matches in hand - the one against Netherlands and then against South Africa. Given that it is highly unlikely for them to pull off an upset against South Africa, this is a must-win match for them. They are currently on 4 points and need at least 6 to be in contention for a quarter-final spot. England are on 5 points with a match against West Indies left, and if Bangladesh win, it will make England's match a must-win for them.Quotes:"Bangladesh are right in the mix and definitely it will be our intention to ruin the party for them." - Netherlands captain, Peter Borren.
"They could be a very dangerous side for us. We have to respect them and play good cricket to beat them." - Bangladesh coach, Jamie Siddons.
