South Africa have won the toss and elected to batHello and welcome to the live coverage of the second ODI between England and South Africa. The first match was washed out due to rain and today's forecast looks promising and we might get a full match. After the KP saga, England will be looking to start fresh and they are bolstered by the return of ODI specialists like Morgan, Kieswetter and Woakes. Stay tuned for the toss....Preview by Nikhil NarainThe picturesque Rose Bowl in Southampton would be the perfect setting for the second ODI between England and South Africa on Tuesday. With the first match at Cardiff being a washout, the series has effectively been reduced to four matches and both the teams would be keen on a good start to take the early advantage. The context to the match assumes significance as the No.1 Ranking is again on the line. If South Africa win at The Rose Bowl, they become the No.1 ranked team across all 3 formats. England would try their best to retain their status as the best ODI side but given how the summer has so far panned out for them- losing their Test No. 1 status to the Proteas and the controversy surrounding the whole Kevin Pietersen saga, they have their task cut out! They need to win this series desperately, not only to boost their morale but to show the world that they can win without the flamboyant Pietersen. The two teams have never encountered each other in Southampton. Stats: Teams batting 1st average 211 on this ground. A total of 14 ODIs have been played at the venue with the team batting first victorious on 6 occasions. It has been a happy hunting ground for the home team having won 6 of their 8 matches here and 5 of their last 6. South Africa have won their only match at the venue against Zimbabwe in 2003. Ian Bell would have good memories of this ground having scored a fluent century against West-Indies in the last ODI played at the venue earlier this year. Tim Bresnan also starred with 4 wickets in that match.England: England would be hoping that Eoin Morgan, Craig Kieswetter and Chris Woakes who are not suffering from the blemishes of the Test-series humiliation would add a new spark and turn their fortunes around. Ravi Bopara would be the key in the middle order along with Bell. In Jimmy Anderson, Graeme Swann and Steven Finn, they have a good bowling unit. South Africa: South Africa, on the other hand would not want to relent the pressure and the dominance they have had over England. The motivation to be the No.1 team across all formats would spur them on and they would come out all guns blazing. Gremem Smith, Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers would provide the backbone to their batting while Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe would lead the bowling attack. Both the countries are expected to retain the same sides that took the field in Cardiff.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Jonathan Trott, Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Craig Kieswetter(w), Tim Bresnan, Chris Woakes, Graeme Swann, Steven Finn, James Anderson, Jonathan Bairstow, Jade Dernbach, Samit PatelSouth Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Graeme Smith, Dean Elgar, AB de Villiers(w/c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Ryan McLaren, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Imran Tahir, Albie Morkel, Dale Steyn, Justin OntongLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
