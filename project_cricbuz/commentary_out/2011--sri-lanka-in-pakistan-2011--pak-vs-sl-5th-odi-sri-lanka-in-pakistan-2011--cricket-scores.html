Asad Shafiq, Junaid Khan and Tanvir are in for Imran Farhat, Sarfraz Ahmed and Aizaz Cheema.Dilshan: It looks like a good pitch to bat on and we opt to bat. The mood in the camp is pretty good and we want to finish on a high. Chamara Silva replaces Mahela.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batStay tuned for the toss and team updates..There are some injury issues for both teams. Mahela Jayawardene and Abdul Razzaq have flown back to their respective countries with injuries and Imran Farhat is a doubtful starter as well.Hello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the final ODI beetween Pakistan and Sri Lanka from Abu Dhabi. It is basically a dead rubber with Pakistan having already won the ODI series at 3-1. Dilshan's captaincy has been criticized but the selectors have shown faith in him by naming him as the captain for the South Africa Test series. They have had a tough tour so far and would like to end it on a positive note. Pakistan have gelled well under Misbah-ul-Haq and will like to finish the ODI series on a high.Preview by Siddharth PrabhakarThe law of gravity says that once you have a fall, the velocity increases at constant acceleration. Something like that is currently happening to the Lankans. They were never a good Test side, except at home. But their ODI squad was, and I daresay still is, a competitive side. Qualifying for the finals of a World Cup is no mean achievement, but their slide after that has been stunning to say the least. They lost the ODI series against England at home, they got beaten by Australia at home and now, they have been thrashed by Pakistan in this series as well. A number of factors can be attributed to this patch of form: The inconsistency of the top order, brittleness of middle order and the blow hot-blow cold bowling. Their traditional strength, spinners operating in the middle overs, has waned to an extent. Pakistan on the other hand, are in vintage touch. They defended a low score in the previous ODI which saw Afridi conjure up a power-packed performance to lead their side to a series clinching victory. With almost all the players in their squad performing in one role or the other, it will be interesting to see who will be dropped to make way for those on the bench. Either way, they will look to extend their dominance with a win to take them to 4-1Pakistan: They have not played to the best of their potential, but the vintage Pakistani fighting spirit is well and truly back. Shahid Afridi put in a brilliant all round show the other night. First he resurrected the innings with a brilliant 75 batting with the tail. There was a moment in the match when everyone thought that he might leave the field with an injured knee. But, he came back and ripped through the Lankan batting line up with his usual variety of leg spinners, top spinners and googlies when Sangakarra and Jayawardene looked set to take their side home. Other than that, the batting has looked solid, with the openers and Younis Khan firing at the right time. The lone problem area might be the form of their captain Misbah, and the maniacal running between the wickets which have contributed to the collapse in the last match. As far as the bowling attack is concerned, Gul and Cheema have been tight up front and later on, and later on Misbah has rotated his spinners Hafeez, Afridi and Ajmal intelligently to choke the opposition. They might want to try out a few new players, especially left arm quick Junaid Khan in the next match and Shoaib Malik might probably get another chance to stake his claim to the middle orderSri Lanka: They looked set to win the 4th ODI, but were blown away by 'Boom Boom' Afridi. The main problem area, as their skipper Dilshan said in the presentation, is that none of the batsmen have risen to the occassion and shouldered the responsibility to see the team through. The batting still revolves around Jayawardene and Sangakkara. None of the youngsters like Jeevan Mendis or Chandimal have grabbed their opportunities. As with the Pakistan side, the form of the Lankan skipper has been really bad and he seemed really disappointed with his own show. Jayawardene will not be playing the final ODI due to an injury and Chamara Silva has been called up as a replacement. Known to come hard from a tight spot, Sri Lanka will look to win the final ODI and restore some pride, especially after the loss in the Test series as well.Quotes:I think action speaks louder than words, a lot has been said but now I want to be a good cricketer and want to perform: AfridiAs a captain I can't do anything to change the players' game.
