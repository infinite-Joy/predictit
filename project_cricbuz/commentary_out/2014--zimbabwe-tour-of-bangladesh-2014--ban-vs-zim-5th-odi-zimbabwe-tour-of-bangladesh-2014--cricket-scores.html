They have struggled against the various assortment of spinners and have meekly surrendered to the hosts. Will they be able to do justice to their talent and go back home on a winning note? Toss and team details in a while..Hello, and a warm welcome to one and all to the fifth and final ODI between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. The hosts have been dominant so far, having won all the three Tests and look set to complete a 5-0 whitewash in the shorter format of the game as well. Mashrafe Mortaza has been inspirational as a captain, leading from the front, as the hosts have looked pretty invincible at times.PreviewOverview:After recording their 50th win at the Sher-E-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur on Friday, Bangladesh stand on the cusp of whitewashing Zimbabwe 5-0 when they take on the visitors in the fifth and final ODI in Dhaka on Monday. The last time they won all the games in a five-match series was in 2006-07 when a Habibul Bashar-led Bangladesh beat a visiting Zimbabwe side. They got close against New Zealand in 2010-11 by winning the series 4-0, but one of the matches was abandoned.Bangladesh:In this series, Bangladesh have been good at wiggling out off potentially tricky situations. In the last game, they recovered from 32 for 4 to post 256 for 8, before their bowlers managed to suffocate the Zimbabwe chase. In fact, Bangladesh have had different people taking up responsibilities at various stages of the series.Tamin Iqbal, Anamul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah have all posted 50+ scores in the series. The return to form of Mahmudullah in the last game particularly pleased the team management. Imrul Kayes, if given another chance in the place of Mominul Haque, after his failure in the fourth ODI, would look to make a case for his inclusion in the World Cup squad. Soumya Sarkar, a fast bowling all-rounder, has been added to the squad and might get a chance to impress the selectors, as Bangladesh look to avoid complacency and achieve a confidence-boosting whitewash.Zimbabwe:Zimbabwe have put up better performances as the series has progressed, but unfortunately, not been able to cross the final mile. Solomon Mire's performances with both the bat and the ball have given them a good lift. They will now play the last game for pride and try to avoid the ignominy of a whitewash.Zimbabwe would particularly hope for some contributions from experienced campaigners like Hamilton Masakadza and Vusi Sibanda. The bowling attack will rue letting Bangladesh off the hook in the last game after they took early wickets and will look to rectify that.Pitch and Conditions:There's been some talk that the Dhaka pitch is expected to offer assistance to the seam bowlers to offer a taste of the conditions expected in Australia-New Zealand during the Cricket World Cup 2015.Teams:Zimbabwe (From): Hamilton Masakadza, Vusi Sibanda, Timycen Maruma, Brendan Taylor, Solomon Mire, Regis Chakabva, Elton Chigumbura(c), Peter Moor(w), Neville Madziva, Tendai Chatara, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Natsai Mushangwe, John Nyumbu, Tawanda Mupariwa, Craig Ervine, Richmond Mutumbami, Tinashe Panyangara, Malcolm Waller, Brian Vitori, Shingirai Masakadza, Sikandar RazaBangladesh (From): Anamul Haque, Tamim Iqbal, Mominul Haque, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Mahmudullah, Sabbir Rahman, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Arafat Sunny, Jubair Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Abul Hasan, Rubel Hossain, Al-Amin Hossain, Imrul KayesLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
