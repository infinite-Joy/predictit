This is certainly going to be an exciting ODI series. The World Cup is nearing and the teams would want to settle their playing XIs by now. A few spots to grab and the team combinations are going to be interesting to see. Okay then, we are all set to go.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Michael Clarke(c), George Bailey, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Clint McKay, Xavier DohertyEngland (Playing XI): Alastair Cook(c), Ian Bell, Joe Root, Gary Ballance, Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara, Jos Buttler(w), Ben Stokes, Tim Bresnan, Chris Jordan, Boyd RankinEngland have won the toss and have opted to batWhere it will be a battle of domination for the hosts, it will be a war to salvage some pride for the visitors. If this ODI series is even half of what the Test series was, we can except a lot of drama and excitement. Hello and a warm welcome for the first of the five ODIs between Australia and England. Toss and teams in a few minutes. Stay tuned....For England, things have gone downhill right from the first Test. The team, which looked solid back home, has been remarkably vulnerable Down Under. Internal rivalry and the unprecedented loss of players either due to illness or retirement, have left them susceptible. They will be without the services of stalwarts like Kevin Pietersen and James Anderson for the ODIs. Also, Stuart Broad has been rested for the first two encounters.The Australian camp is on a high. After humiliating England with a 5-0 whitewash, there is little left to prove for a mentally strong and tough Australian team. Their confidence can be gauged from the fact they have dared to rest Mitchell Johnson, their demolition man, for the opening ODI and ignored James Pattinson for the same. However, with in-form players who have had an exceptional Test campaign, Australia would like to go all guns blazing in this first encounter.PreviewAll is well with the Australian camp. They avenged the humiliation in England with a clinical 5-0 demolition of their arch-rivals in the Ashes and are now determined to make the visitors dance to their tunes in the ODI series, starting Sunday. They have already rested Mitchell Johnson while fit-again James Pattinson was not considered for the opening ODI.Australia: Opening batsman Shaun Marsh has also been unable to win selection for Sunday's opener, with Aaron Finch likely to partner David Warner at the top of the order and Shane Watson at number three.Pattinson was sent home from the 2013 Ashes tour with a back injury, but he has claimed seven wickets in three Big Bash League games recently.While Australia's ODI series with England is a crucial warm-up for the 2015 World Cup to be hosted by Australia and New Zealand, it's also a chance for players like Pattinson to audition for a spot in the Test squad to tour South Africa in late January.Clarke has said Australia would take winning momentum into the ODI series, but that would come from Australia's 2-1 ODI series win in England in September rather than their recent five-nil Ashes whitewash.Key Players: Watch out for David Warner, who was outstanding in the Ashes and promises to make 2014 his year after a tumultuous 2013. Also eager to impress would be George Bailey, who after his roaring success in the ODIs against India, was Australia's weakest link in the Test series. This could well be his last chance to impress the selectors before Australia's much anticipated tour of South Africa next month.England: England go into the opening one-day international in Melbourne on Sunday desperate to salvage some pride, but face a torrid task with a fired-up Australia vowing no let-up after dominating the Ashes.The first of five matches, a day-nighter, is the first opportunity to see how the shell-shocked tourists progress from their nightmare Test series, with captain Alastair Cook demanding an improvement, and quickly.The series could see either team reclaim the number one limited-overs world ranking, depending on how India fare when they face New Zealand in a five-match series that begins in Napier on January 19.India are currently the top-ranked one-day team in the world, followed by Australia and England, with all three building towards next year's 50-over World Cup.A rattled England head into the series without the experience of Kevin Pietersen and Jimmy Anderson, who have both been rested, with Cook leading a team that has much to prove.He also needs to rebuild dressing room discipline with Test wicketkeeper Matt Prior on Thursday saying that during the Ashes, the players had shown a lack of respect for both the captain and coach Andy Flower -- who is reportedly at odds with Pietersen.Former left-arm spinner Ashley Giles has taken over from Flower as the one-day coach, assuming responsibility with Cook for repairing some of the damage inflicted by Australia.Only all-rounder Ben Stokes and paceman Stuart Broad came out of the Ashes with a semblance of pride, leaving the door open for the likes of Danny Briggs, Jos Buttler, Chris Jordan, Ravi Bopara and Chris Woakes to stake their claims in the one-day format.Broad will be rested for the matches in Melbourne and Brisbane - as well as a tour game in Canberra in between - to allow him time to recover from the Test series, an England and Wales Cricket Board spokeswoman confirmed to Press Association Sport.The 27-year-old was England's leading wicket-taker in the 5-0 defeat and one of the few tourists to finish the series in some credit.Key Players: Much maligned and criticised, Cook will want to show he is the right man to lead England in this rather difficult phase. The southpaw struggled against Johnson's raw pace and he will be relived that his tormentor will not feature in the season opener.Kevin Pietersen will also be a crucial cog in the wheel for England and should spur the visitors on if he gets going. After a dismal Test series, Pietersen will look to make amends and show his teammates just why he is the best player in England.When you strip everything down, every single player has to go back and have a look at themselves, have a look at their techniques. Have a look at the way they've bowled and start rebuilding again.And that hunger has to come from within to do it. - Alastair Cook, England captainThis is an important series because we will be playing in the same facilities that we will play the World Cup in, the same pitches, and against an opposition that is going to play a huge role. - Michael Clarke, Australia captainStats: 270: The number of runs Michael Clarke needs to surpass Ricky Ponting as the top run-scorer against England in ODIs.
