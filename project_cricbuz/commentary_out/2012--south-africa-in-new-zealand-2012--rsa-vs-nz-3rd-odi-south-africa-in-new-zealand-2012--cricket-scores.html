Kyle Mills will open the attackde Lange was the star of the show and he richly deserved to get to a 5-fer. Would've been some feat had he achieved it - there have been only a handful of bowlers who have taken 5-fers on debut in both formats. He bowled with real pace and hostility and hustled out the Kiwis. The slow bowlers were effective too and Peterson was impressive with his drift in to the right-handers. NZ lost wickets to some poor strokes and lost them at regular intervals. No one kicked on and they have failed to last the 50 overs yet again. SA hold all the aces and are favorites to make it 3-0.

Kyle Mills lbw b Peterson 5(9) Peterson to Kyle Mills, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Kyle Mills is given out LBW. He is reviewing it. Looks stone dead. Should be OUT. It is out.

NEW ZEALAND:41.5  de Lange to Ellis, out Caught by Amla at 1st slip!! This is brilliant fast bowling from de Lange. NZ are disintegrating rapidly. Short and aimed at the chest of Ellis, who hops and looks to defend, the ball flies off the splice of the bat towards the throat of Amla who takes it well. That was bowled at 146 kmph and was extremely well directed. Can he get a five-fer? Ellis c Amla b de Lange 2(2) de Lange to Ellis, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Similar dismissal to McCullum's - the bat turning in the hand. Franklin c Amla b de Lange 36(52) [4s-3] de Lange to Franklin, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

C de Grandhomme has had a sighter of Duminy, sees the flight on that delivery, takes a couple of steps out and lofts it cleanly over long on.

Tsotsobe will open the attackSo finally, the players are out in the middle and we are going to have some cricketPitch Report: Mark Richardson says that there is heavy rain predicted in the afternoon but it will get better in the evening. The pitch is hard enough, but it looks a bit tacky. There will be some extra bounce and it might hold up on the track. The pitch could get greasy if the bowlers drag some moisture on their followthrough. There is a strong wind blowing across the ground and the batsmen will favour the straight boundaries.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Rob Nicol, Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(w/c), Kane Williamson, James Franklin, Colin de Grandhomme, Nathan McCullum, Andrew Ellis, Kyle Mills, Michael Bates, Andy McKaySouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(w/c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Albie Morkel, Johan Botha, Robin Peterson, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Marchant de Lange, Lonwabo TsotsobeBrendon McCullum: We would have looked to bowl first. Hopefully, the weather holds. Colin de Grandhomme makes his debut today. Southee is also rested. We are determined to avoid the whitewash. We will hope to put up a better performance. 90% of the players are outstanding but we hope that the team puts in a better performance.AB de Villiers: We will bowl first. The wicket looks a bit sticky. Kallis is out and Parnell replaces him. Ontong twisted his ankle and Botha comes in. We are resting Morne Morkel and Marchant de Lange comes in. We would love to achieve a whitewash.South Africa have won the toss and elected to fieldAt the moment, it is not raining. We still do not have any news about what time the toss will be. The main covers are coming off and the toss is expected to happen shortly. There is a nice patch of weather coming up, according to Ian Smith.Looks like the groundstaff are going to have a busy day. There is another large squall of rain and it looks like the toss might not happen in 10 minutes time.Well, this is typical New Zealand weather. Suddenly, it is sunny and Mark Richardson says that the toss will be in about 10 minutes time.Oh dear, the weather is not all that great at Auckland. There is a large squall of rain that is lashing down at Eden Park. The covers are firmly in place. Well, not firmly, as some of the ground-staff are lying down on the cover so that it does not fly off!On the other hand, New Zealand have looked brittle in all departments. Guptill and Brendon McCullum have been the only players who have contributed with the bat. The rest have failed to cope up with the batting. With the recent axing of Doug Bracewell and Jesse Ryder due to indiscipline, the frustration mounts for the team. The bowling has not threatened much either. The Kiwis will look to avoid the whitewash and build some confidence ahead of the Tests starting on March 7th. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.Morne Morkel was the star with the ball in the previous ODI. He picked up his maiden five wicket haul and he tore through the fragile Kiwi middle and lower order. Dale Steyn has still not gotten into his stride and he will be desperate to put up a good show here ahead of the Test series. The South African batting line-up has looked solid, with Amla, Duminy, du Plessis and AB de Villiers chipping in with vital contributions. Jacques Kallis has still not fired with the bat and he will look to get some runs under his belt today.Welcome to the 3rd and final ODI between New Zealand and South Africa from Auckland. South Africa have already clinched the series and they will be aiming for a whitewash against a New Zealand team that is being plagued by problems both on and off the field.Teams:South Africa (From): AB de Villiers(w/c), Hashim Amla, Johan Botha, Marchant de Lange, Jean-Paul Duminy, Colin Ingram, Richard Levi, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Justin Ontong, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Juan Theron, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Faf du Plessis, Jacques Kallis, Graeme Smith, Dale SteynNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(w/c), Michael Bates, Doug Bracewell, Colin de Grandhomme, Andrew Ellis, James Franklin, Martin Guptill, Ronnie Hira, Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Rob Nicol, Jacob Oram, Tim Southee, Kane Williamson, Jesse Ryder, Tom Latham, Andy McKay, Tarun NethulaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
