Tharanga is on strike. Umar Gul will open the attackWelcome back. The fielders are out on the field. Will Sri Lanka chase down these runs? Or will the Pakistan bowlers prevail? Stay tuned as we bring you the coverageWith the start their openers gave them, Pakistan looked set to reach 300 given the fact that mighty hitters like Razzaq and Afridi were to follow. But once the openers got out, none of the others could really push the scoring rate. The Lankans bowled really well in the second half of the innings. Once again Malinga stood out with some excellent yorkers at the end, but the pick of the bowlers was S Prasanna who gave away just 39 runs picking up 2 wickets. If not for some streaky boundaries and Younis Khan batting at the end, Pakistan might not have reached even 250. All said and done, Sri Lanka will have to bat really well to win this match. Join us in about half an hour for the chase.4

This is Sid V to take you through for the first half of this innings.Mahela Jayawardene: I am a little excited about reaching 10000 ODI runs. It is there in the back of my mind but I am focused on winning this game. We have to keep doing things that we did right. There is still some room for improvement. We have to put pressure on Pakistan. It was not a concern to me that I was not scoring runs. I was focused and I knew it was a question of only one innings. I am happy to bat at No.5.Hafeez: It was disappointing to lose the second ODI. Malinga bowled well in that match. We have to prepare for factors like Dew. Afridi is a key member of the team. We are bowling well as a unit and we have a good team composition. Misbah is leading the team well. I am working hard in the nets and I have to stay at the wicket for a longer time. I never work hard on my bowling but in the last one year, I have worked on my bowling. I thank the management for backing me. I enjoy bowling with the new ball and I look to give my all while bowling. Sri Lanka is a great side and the coming three matches will be close.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Thissara Perera, Seekkuge Prasanna, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara FernandoPakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Farhat, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Abdul Razzaq, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul, Saeed AjmalDilshan: The batting, fielding and bowling all clicked in the previous match. It is fantastic to have Malinga in the team. We have the same team.Misbah: There is one change. Aizaz Cheema is out for today's game and Sohail Tanvir is in. He has a lot of experience and that should help us. The batsmen have to show responsibility. We have to go back to the basics and the batsmen have to build partnerships.Pakistan have won the toss and elected to batToday is the 'Two Sids' show. I, Sid V, will be joined by Sid P as we bring you this all important clash between these two teams.Welcome to the 3rd ODI between Pakistan and Sri Lanka from Dubai. The series has come alive after Sri Lanka's victory in the previous ODI. They will be looking to carry on with the momentum that they have gained. Pakistan, on the other hand, will be disappointed with their batting performance in the previous ODI and they will be looking to get their act together. Join us in a short while for the toss and the team updates.Preview by Siddharth PrabhakarThe battle is set for the third game of a very exciting series. Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won a game each in the 5 match series and now is the time either team will look to gain the advantage. Usually the momentum, and in most cases the winner, is decided by the momentum shift that occurs midway through a series. The teams are as closely matched in talent and preparation as the scoreline 1-1 would suggest. Pakistan, having won the Test series convincingly romped home in the first game. The Lankan batsmen, who failed to pass muster in that game, looked set for another collapse in the second ODI as well, but managed to keep their nerves. Led by their bowlers they inflicted a damage similar to the one on their batting order, on the opponents. Scores settled, both teams will look to inflict new wounds. Pakistan: By far the most impressive and most improved team amongst their contemporaries, they were given a severe jolt by the loss in the second ODI. They looked a compact side till then with a colourful variety in their bowling attack. Bolstered by the return of Afridi and Razzaq, they have been spoilt for choice and the fact that the dangerous Junaid Khan is sitting on the bench goes to show the quality of their eleven. While their ability to pick up 10 wickets cannot be questioned, there are a few chinks in the batting armour. Firstly, they don't have a free flowing and quick scoring batter in their top order. Though Afridi and Razzaq have in the past performed that role with much success, the Pakistan management seems hesitant to use them in that role. This handicap means that if wickets are lost in succession, the scoring rate also plummets. Although Misbah and Younis provide strength on the basis of their experience, their style of batting is not well suited to the current T20 attitude. Umar Akmal, who dazzled in the previous match with a knock of 91 that almost saw his team through, can be promoted up the order. The team will also look to Afridi and Razzaq for some fireworks in the powerplay for the 2nd ODI was lost in the batting powerplay where they could manage only 26/3 as compared to Sri Lanka's 48/0. The bowling has been much talked about, but they might want to key up their catching in the outfield which will make their bowlers look even more dangerous.Sri Lanka: The Lankan side has looked out of sorts since Murali's retirement. Their bowling performance in the Tests has been abject, but given the fact that they are the World Cup finalists, a stronger showing was expected in the ODIs. The Sri Lankan opening pair have been the ones to give a strong start since the 1996 World cup and nothing less is expected from Dilshan and Tharanga. Although the latter responded well sculpting a slow 77, the skipper needs to fire because when he does, his team will be propelled to a big score. The middle order looks weak with Sangakkara and Chandimal not in the best touch, but Jayawardene's return to form will boost their confidence. Malinga and Perera throttled Pakistan's batsmen with accurate bowling and though they will look to repeat the show, the ineffectiveness of the spinners will be a worry. Suraj Randiv might be drafted into the playing eleven as he is an excellent fielder inside the 30 yard circle apart from being a good off spinner. Quotes:We discussed about mistakes committed in the last game. We dropped a catch, then gave away 17 extra runs and lost early wickets while batting so we need to overcome those mistakes if we want to win the next game: MisbahWe played some good cricket and can take a lot of positives into Friday's game because that's an important match for both the teams as they can take lead in the series: DilshanTeams:Pakistan (From): Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Abdur Rehman, Aizaz Cheema, Asad Shafiq, Imran Farhat, Junaid Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Malik, Umar Gul, Younis Khan, Abdul Razzaq, Shahid Afridi, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Sohail Tanvir, Umar AkmalSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Mahela Jayawardene, Suraj Randiv, Kosala Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dilhara Fernando, Dimuth Karunaratne, Lasith Malinga, Jeevan Mendis, Thissara Perera, Upul Tharanga, Seekkuge PrasannaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
