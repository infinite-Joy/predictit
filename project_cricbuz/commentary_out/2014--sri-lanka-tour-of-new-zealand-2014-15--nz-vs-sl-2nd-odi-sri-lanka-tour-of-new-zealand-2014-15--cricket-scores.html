For Sri Lanka, Herath replaces Eranga.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Tom Latham, Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Trent Boult, Matt HenrySri Lanka (Playing XI): Dimuth Karunaratne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath, Sachithra SenanayakeNew Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batThe visitors would want to win this one to equalize the series. On the other hand, the hosts will look to exert their dominance with another win. The Kiwis will be hampered by Kane Williamson's absence as he has been ruled out of the next 3 ODIs with a shoulder injury. Grant Elliot may also miss the game due to personal reasons. However, the hosts will be boosted by the return of Ross Taylor. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.Corey Anderson stepped up when his team needed him and played a gritty knock. He compiled good partnerships with Ronchi and Nathan McCullum to guide the team to safer shores and the Kiwis eventually won by 3 wickets. Hello and welcome to the second ODI between New Zealand and Sri Lanka at Hamilton.The Kiwis bowling looked sharp yet again. Even though Tim Southee didn't play the game, McClenaghan and Milne were superb for the hosts, picking up 4 and 2 wickets respectively. However, New Zealand didn't find it easy with the bat in hand. Guptill got out without troubling the scorers, but McCullum was back to his blazing best, reaching his fifty in just 19 balls. He perished soon after and that lead to a small collapse as the visitors were reduced to 101/5 from 63/1 at one stage.After the 2-0 loss in the Test series, Sri Lanka found it difficult to get going in the first of the 7-match ODI series. Apart from Mahela Jayawardene, the visitors batting looked way below par. In fact, 6 of the 11 players couldn't go past a single digit score.Preview:After losing the first ODI in Christchurch, the visitors would look to turnaround their fortunes in the second game to be played at the scenic Seddon Park, Hamilton. The first ODI turned out to be a see-saw encounter, with the fortunes of both sides swinging back and forth several times, before the hosts emerged victorious by three wickets.New ZealandWith New Zealand's bowlers landing blows at regular intervals in the first match, it would have gladdened the hearts of the think-tank. The left-arm seamer, Mitchell McClenaghan, who has been known for his ability to take a truckload of wickets in the end overs ever since he made his debut for Central Districts back in 2008-09, yet again proved his worth in letters of gold by taking a four-wicket haul.It was McClenaghan's tried and tested formula of varying his lengths that helped the left-arm pacer to snaffle four wickets. McClenaghan, sticks to bowling back of a length, but on occasions, he surprises the batsman by bowling it full and slanting it across the right-hander. He also uses the slower bouncer to good effect. In the first match in Christchurch, with those subtle changes of length, he took bushels of wickets, including three wickets in a single over.Adam Milne, who with his blistering speed can scare the wits of a batsman, played his part as well by snaring two wickets. It is always a boon to have a genuine quick in the ranks as it lifts the fielding side.However, the coaching staff would be a trifle concerned with the batting line-up. Most of their batsmen weren't able to convert starts into big scores. Brendon McCullum, with his broad blade, powered his way to another of those whirlwind fifties. However, he was dismissed after composing a crunching fifty. Only Corey Anderson down the order, showed spunk and spirit to aggregate 81 and shepherd New Zealand to win.Sri LankaThe visitors would rue the fact that they were able to notch up only 218 on the board. Only Mahela Jayawardene, with his majestic beauty of his silken smooth batsmanship, amassed a fine hundred. The rest of the batsmen, including experienced campaigner, Kumar Sangakkara, failed to come to the party.On the positive side for the Lankans, swing bowler, Nuwan Kulasekara, by picking up two wickets, showed that he could do well in Australia ad New Zealand. The delivery to dismiss Grant Elliott jagged back appreciably off the wicket and that gives an indication. Kulasekara is also good at extracting seam movement. Both sides are known as fine fielding units and that should keep the batsmen on tenterhooks, when they look to steal singles.Pitch conditions:The track at Seddon Park tended to favour the team batting second in the 1980s, but in recent times, the toss hasn't been a crucial factor. On a small ground, 270-280 can be a par score.Team News:Grant Elliott may miss the second ODI due to a personal problem. Kane Williamson, New Zealand's main batsman, has already been ruled out of the next three ODIs due to a shoulder injury. Ross Taylor is back, after sitting out of the first ODI.Quotes:It was good (talking about his knock). First time, I am playing in Christchurch. It was disappointing to miss the Test match but this knock feels good. I am feeling alright with the bowling, but it gets a little hard during the middle overs. I will keep training and get my body back in shape: Corey Anderson.We were about 30-40 runs short. It was not the easiest wicket to bat on, it was a little bit two paced. We had to work hard, the batters had to hang in there but, we kept losing wickets: Angelo Mathews.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Dimuth Karunaratne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Sachithra Senanayake, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suranga Lakmal, Dinesh Chandimal, Shaminda Eranga, Rangana Herath, Dhammika Prasad, Lasith MalingaNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Tom Latham, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Mitchell McClenaghan, Adam Milne, Trent Boult, Tim Southee, Daniel Vettori, Kyle MillsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
