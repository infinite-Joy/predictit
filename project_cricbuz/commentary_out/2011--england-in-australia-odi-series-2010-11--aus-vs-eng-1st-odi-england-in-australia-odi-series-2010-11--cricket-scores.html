Watson is on strike. Bresnan will open the attackIt has been a marvelous fightback by the Aussies after Strauss and Davies got England off to a flier. Both tackled the short ball confidently and scored at nearly seven runs per over. At one point, a score of 350 looked possible. However, David Hussey struck twice in quick succession and the spinners restricted the scoring rate. Pietersen started off confidently and reached his fifty with two massive hits. Steven Smith also got some quick wickets as he sent back Morgan and Bell. England opted to take the batting PP, but that backfired on them as they lost Pietersen in the first over. The tail struggled to hang around and England were bowled out for 294. This is still a good total, considering that the wicket is on the slow side. Australia will have to bat well against an England bowling attack that looks strong. Join us shortly for the run chase.4
