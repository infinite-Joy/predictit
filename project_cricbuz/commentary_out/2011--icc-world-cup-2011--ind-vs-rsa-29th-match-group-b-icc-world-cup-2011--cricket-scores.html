SOUTH AFRICA:49.4 49.4 Nehra to Peterson, FOUR!!, fuller delivery outside the off stump, and that's been driven through cover, SA have won the game! Peterson turns out to be the last minute hero for them, he yells out in joy and pumps his fist, it was a good fight though, a nail-biter and Smith can proudly say, 'Put the chokers tag to rest'
SOUTH AFRICA:49.3  Nehra to Peterson, 2 runs, Peterson came down the track and inside edged it to the right of Dhoni, he initially decided to run after the ball, but Sachin Tendulkar was running in, Dhoni comes back near the stumps, a direct hit from Tendlya but Peterson is in, the umpire went up for the third umpire and it is ruled not outTensed faces all around, but it looks like it is heading the South African way, the first two balls have done most of the job.
SOUTH AFRICA:49.2  Nehra to Peterson, SIX!!, that's probably sealed things for South Africa, they are silencing all their critics, a length ball from Nehra, in the slot, Peterson slog sweeps it over deep mid wicket, away she goes!
SOUTH AFRICA:49.1  Nehra to Peterson, FOUR!!, that's the start SA would have hoped for, the rub of the green is not with the Indians, Peterson was looking for the slog sweep, gets an inside edge and the ball rolls away to the fine leg boundary, there was nothing Dhoni could doZaheer comes upto Nehra, has a word or two, is it the time to give tips or is it the time to pray? It has gone down to the wire, what a game! 13 needed off 6 deliveriesWho will bowl the last over? It's the smiling Ashish Nehra!Nehra's prowess or is there any?: Not one soul in our office is convinced that Nehra can win it for India. I though, have a different story to tell. My mind goes back to the Pakistan v India tour in 2004. The first ODI at Karachi, when India had made 348 if my memory serves me right. Nehra calmly took the ball and bowled the final over, in the end India won by 4 runs. Will history repeat itself?
SOUTH AFRICA:48.6  Zaheer to du Plessis, no run, that's an excellent over from Zaheer, just five runs off it, another yorker length delivery, turned out to be a full toss as du Plessis walked forward, he misses and Dhoni collects
SOUTH AFRICA:48.5  Zaheer to Peterson, 1 run, too full again, a low full toss rather, Peterson drives hard to sweeper cover, only a single, the crowd are happy with it
SOUTH AFRICA:48.4  Zaheer to Peterson, no run, that's experience for you, another yorker outside off, Peterson can't squeeze that anywhere, he misses
SOUTH AFRICA:48.3  Zaheer to du Plessis, 1 run, another yorker length delivery outside off, du Plessis squeezes it down to third man
SOUTH AFRICA:48.2  Zaheer to Peterson, 1 run, fuller delivery on the off stump, Peterson just taps it to the off side, du Plessis set off for a single, at one stage both batsmen were running towards the same end, Peterson has to run, Raina is the fielder, he fumbles and Zaheer takes some time to remove the bails, Peterson is safe, poor fielding, very poor!The third umpire has been called for a run-out chance, has Raina made a mess of it?A long chat going on between Tendulkar and Zaheer, they are making a lot of changes in the field. Harbhajan moves to the on side and Nehra goes the other way.
SOUTH AFRICA:48.1  Zaheer to du Plessis, 1 run, good ball that, in the blockhole and around the leg stump, drilled down to long on, just a singleZaheer Khan [9.0-0-39-1] is back into the attackWell, will Dhoni's tactic pay off? Can Bhajji bowl the last over?A super catch: It was a great catch by Raina, he is one of the best fielders in the side and Zak was running back from cover, one eye would have been on him, but Raina kept his eyes and never looked at the man coming in the opposite direction. Never looked like dropping it.
SOUTH AFRICA:47.6  Munaf Patel to du Plessis, 1 run, fuller one on the off stump, driven down to long off, singleRobin Peterson, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:47.5 Munaf Patel to Botha, out Caught by (sub)Raina!! Botha wants to go for another biggie, does not get it right this time, looked to swing through the line with high back-lift, the face of the bat was pointing to the sky and the ball ballooned up in the air, Raina came running from long off and takes a good one, he falls over to complete the running catch, Zaheer was also running after the ball from extra cover, but Raina called for it, and to say the least, there is another twist in the tale. Botha c (sub)Raina b Munaf Patel 23(15) [4s-2 6s-1] Munaf Patel to Botha, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SOUTH AFRICA:47.4  Munaf Patel to Botha, SIX!!, just a length ball, Botha takes toll, goes over long on, clears the ropes with ease, the game has just swung in favor of the Proteas, 18 from 14 now!
SOUTH AFRICA:47.3  Munaf Patel to Botha, FOUR!!, Botha swings across the line, gets it past the man at short mid wicket, it was YP who dived to his right to no avail, Kohli at long on runs wide, about 50-60 mts says Robin Jackman on air, he dives, gets a hand to it but can't prevent the ball from reaching the boundary
SOUTH AFRICA:47.2  Munaf Patel to Botha, 2 runs, Botha makes room and slaps hard through extra cover, calls for two straight away and makes it comfortably
SOUTH AFRICA:47.1  Munaf Patel to du Plessis, 1 run, a horrid ball from Munaf Patel, a full toss well outside off, du Plessis reaches out for it and meets it a bit too early, ends up slicing it to sweeper cover, had du Plessis missed it, it would have probably been a wideFood for thought: The last time MS Dhoni mis-calculated the overs and finished off Zak early against England, which meant that Munaf had to bowl the final over. That game ended in a tie. Today he won't do that. 48th for Munna and the last two will be bowled by Bhajji and Zak. 
SOUTH AFRICA:46.6  Harbhajan to Botha, 2 runs, fuller delivery on the off stump, driven wide of long off, Nehra at long off is a bit lazy as always, to be fair to him it also went a bit wide, the batsmen take two
SOUTH AFRICA:46.5  Harbhajan to Botha, no run, superb delivery that! Quicker one, skids across, pitches on leg and just misses the off stump as Botha misses the pull
SOUTH AFRICA:46.4  Harbhajan to Botha, no run, Harbhajan comes round the wicket and bowls one on the leg stump, Botha can't get the sweep going, hit on the body
SOUTH AFRICA:46.3  Harbhajan to du Plessis, 1 run, fuller again, around the off stump, du Plessis comes down the wicket and drives it to long off
SOUTH AFRICA:46.2  Harbhajan to Botha, 1 run, fuller this time around, Botha works it behind square on the on side
SOUTH AFRICA:46.1  Harbhajan to du Plessis, 1 run, du Plessis goes back and across, tucks it to mid wicketWell, it is still in balance, 36 in 4 overs. They are all big hitters, mind you. Wickets are the need of the hour for India
SOUTH AFRICA:45.6  Munaf Patel to du Plessis, 1 run, similar to the previous one, tucked through mid wicket, Raina is the man charging in and they settle for a single
SOUTH AFRICA:45.5  Munaf Patel to du Plessis, 2 runs, the runs are coming at will, India need wickets here. In the channel outside off, du Plessis shuffles across and works it to deep mid wicket, played it with soft hands, allowed them to get back comfortably for the second run
SOUTH AFRICA:45.4  Munaf Patel to Botha, 1 run, Botha chips this one over the vacant mid off region, on a couple of bounces to YP at long off, just a single this time around
SOUTH AFRICA:45.3  Munaf Patel to Botha, 2 runs, fabulous running between the two men, pitched up and nipping back in, Botha works it with soft hands towards long on, they sense a second and complete it with ease
SOUTH AFRICA:45.2  Munaf Patel to Botha, FOUR!!, one has to say, this was a poor delivery! Width on offer and the field was not set for that kind of a delivery, Botha cuts it late, wide of third man and it will go all the way
SOUTH AFRICA:45.1  Munaf Patel to Botha, no run, good line and length that, fuller and angled in, Botha can't do much, pushes it down the wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:44.6  Harbhajan to Botha, leg byes, 1 run, Dhoni misses a possible stumping chance, fired on the pad, the ball flips the thigh and goes wide of Dhoni, he did get some hand to it, and the ball rolls behind as the batsmen scamper through for another single
SOUTH AFRICA:44.5  Harbhajan to du Plessis, 1 run, a touch fuller, worked away off his toes to deep square leg, the 250 is up for them
SOUTH AFRICA:44.4  Harbhajan to du Plessis, no run, given a bit of air, driven to Zaheer at mid off
SOUTH AFRICA:44.3  Harbhajan to Botha, 1 run, Botha shuts the face of the bat and turns it to deep square leg
SOUTH AFRICA:44.2  Harbhajan to Botha, no run, dot balls are adding the pressure and the Proteas are not known for thriving under pressure situations, this one's worked straight to Raina at short mid wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:44.1  Harbhajan to du Plessis, 1 run, turns into du Plessis, he tucks it to square leg for a singleJohan Botha, right handed bat, comes to the creaseSaurabh Somani on twitter: Munaf literally begged and begged until the umpire raised his finger there! 
SOUTH AFRICA:43.6  Munaf Patel to Wyk, out Lbw!! SA lose a review as up goes the finger. Gambhir can breathe a sigh of relief, Wyk was going for the reverse sweep, the ball pitched on middle and nipped back in, the reverse sweep is one of those shots when it doesn't connect, it really does look stupid, Wyk is rapped in front of middle and leg, the ball was going on to clip the leg stump, hawk eye says on field call and Wyk has to walk back into the hut. Wyk lbw b Munaf Patel 5(5) [4s-1] Munaf Patel to Wyk, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!van Wyk has been given OUT LBW, the batsman has opted for the review. Looks plumb.
SOUTH AFRICA:43.5  Munaf Patel to du Plessis, 1 run, du Plessis goes back and tucks it to mid wicket, takes a quick single
SOUTH AFRICA:43.4  Munaf Patel to Wyk, leg byes, 1 run, back of a length and angled in, goes off the pad to the on side
SOUTH AFRICA:43.3  Munaf Patel to Wyk, FOUR!!, that should have been taken, an opportunity let off! Boy, hasn't he misjudged it, Wyk went for the sweep, got a top edge, Gambhir at backward square leg runs in, slips just before he goes to take the catch, lets the ball through his hands, and to add salt to the wound, the ball goes to the boundary, Munaf can't believe it, Dhoni's expressions speak a thousand words
SOUTH AFRICA:43.2  Munaf Patel to du Plessis, 1 run, du Plessis backs away and slices it down to third man, Tendulkar, the centurion, keeps it down to one
SOUTH AFRICA:43.1  Munaf Patel to du Plessis, no run, du Plessis makes room and slaps hard, can't get it past the man at extra cover, every dot ball is being welcomed with loud cheers at NagpurMunaf Patel [7.0-0-35-0] is back into the attackMind you, 57 off 42 with 5 wickets in hand is still gettable. The only aspect that could make the difference is PRESSURE. Which team will choke under pressure?Saurabh Somani comes up with another one: This is a pendulum-like environment to be in. Every run of South Africa is greeted by deafening silence. Any save by an Indian fielder is cheered vociferously.
SOUTH AFRICA:42.6  Harbhajan to du Plessis, 1 run, du Plessis goes back and tucks it behind square on the on side for a single to retain the strike
SOUTH AFRICA:42.5  Harbhajan to Wyk, 1 run, Wyk plays it close to the body, dabs it to short third man to get off the mark
SOUTH AFRICA:42.4  Harbhajan to Wyk, no run, Wyk gets well across looking to help it fine, misses and the ball goes over the leg stump, not called a wideMorne van Wyk, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:42.4  Harbhajan to Duminy, wide, out Stumped!! If not the de Villiers dismissal, this one has certainly brought India back into the game. Duminy came a long way down the wicket, Harbhajan fired it down the leg, Dhoni didn't collect it well, fumbled a couple of times and on the third attempt he takes the ball from the ground and whips the bails off, it was too late by the time Duminy realised that he had a chance to get back into the crease, the third umpire's help wasn't required, he was a long way down. Bhajji-Dhoni combo does the trick. Duminy st Dhoni b Harbhajan 23(20) [4s-2 6s-1] Harbhajan to Duminy, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!
SOUTH AFRICA:42.3  Harbhajan to Duminy, no run, Duminy reverse sweeps, middles it, but straight to the man at point, Yusuf Pathan was the man
SOUTH AFRICA:42.2  Harbhajan to du Plessis, 1 run, flatter and quicker, du Plessis clips it to backward square leg
SOUTH AFRICA:42.1  Harbhajan to Duminy, 1 run, Duminy comes down the wicket and works it wide of long on, thought of taking two but du Plessis is not too keenLol Moment: There is tension everywhere, Robin Jackman on air calls Sanjay Manjrekar, Manjay Sanjrekar
SOUTH AFRICA:41.6  Yuvraj to du Plessis, SIX!!, du Plessis has marked his arrival! Dances down the wicket and lofts it handsomeley over long off, Yusuf Pathan at long off couldn't do much but just watch the ball go over the ropes
SOUTH AFRICA:41.5  Yuvraj to du Plessis, 2 runs, du Plessis pulls it wide of Munaf Patel at long on, not one of the better fielders in the side, easy two
SOUTH AFRICA:41.4  Yuvraj to Duminy, 1 run, Duminy looks to use his feet but Yuvraj drags it short, Duminy had to check his shot, turns it to the on side
SOUTH AFRICA:41.3  Yuvraj to du Plessis, 1 run, flatter but on the shorter side, du Plessis goes back and pulls it wide of Bhajji at mid wicket, allows him to cross over, Bhajji slid well to keep it down to one

SOUTH AFRICA:41.1  Yuvraj to du Plessis, no run, fired in on the off stump, du Plessis turns it to the off side using his wrists, there is a close in fielder at point, Sachin is the man, no chance of a runDhoni is not left with many choices, Yuvraj Singh [7.0-0-37-0] is back into the attackSaurabh Somani who is clearly on fire, from the venue chimes in: The game's not yet over folks. AB was South Africa's most dangerous man, but JP Duminy has been on an awesome run of his own. Since May 2010, Duminy has averaged almost 65 in ODIs with a strike rate of 91.5.
SOUTH AFRICA:40.6  Harbhajan to du Plessis, 1 run, that's a good over from Harbhajan, gets a wicket and only concedes 7 runs, on the shorter side again, turning in, du Plessis works it to mid wicket, gets off the mark
SOUTH AFRICA:40.5  Harbhajan to Duminy, 1 run, fligted, Duminy drives it past mid on for a single
SOUTH AFRICA:40.4  Harbhajan to Duminy, no run, trifle short from Harbhajan, cut straight to the man at pointFaf du Plessis, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:40.3  Harbhajan to de Villiers, out Caught by Kohli!! Wicket No. 250 for Bhajji, he gives it a bit of air, de Villiers goes for the slog sweep, gets it out of the middle of the bat, but does not get as much power as he would have wanted, there was a Kohli at deep mid wicket, he lunges forward and takes it inches off the ground, ABD departs soon after his fifty and India are back in the game. de Villiers c Kohli b Harbhajan 52(39) [4s-6 6s-1] Harbhajan to de Villiers, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SOUTH AFRICA:40.2  Harbhajan to de Villiers, FOUR!!, the reverse-sweep, more of a reverse-slog-sweep, had made up his mind, gets it over the infield and it had four written all over it, 26th ODI fifty, third in WCs and third against India!
SOUTH AFRICA:40.1  Harbhajan to Duminy, 1 run, Duminy uses his feet, gets to the pitch of the ball and works it wide of Nehra at mid on, he does well to run and dive to his left, keeps it down to one, the fielding has been better compared to the other matchesHarbhajan Singh [5.0-0-33-1] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:39.6  Zaheer to Duminy, 1 run, too full, off-stumpish, Duminy digs it out to point and takes another single, 17 runs off that Zaheer overThe bat is broken as a result of that six, change of willow for Duminy
SOUTH AFRICA:39.5  Zaheer to Duminy, SIX!!, Is this the over that would take the game away from the Indians, fuller one from Zaheer, slower one, Duminy gets his front leg across, gets under it, skies it up in the air as the bat was pointing up, didn't time it as well as he would have wanted, but the bats these days I tell you, it carries all the way! Straight down the ground and into the sight screen.
SOUTH AFRICA:39.4  Zaheer to de Villiers, 1 run, tries another yorker, a low full toss on the off stump, de Villiers drills it to long off
SOUTH AFRICA:39.3  Zaheer to de Villiers, FOUR!!, make it two in a row! de Villiers gets forward and slices it over backward point, the batting PP is on which means, there would be only three fielders outside the 30 yard circle, sadly for Zaheer, there is nobody at square third man, boundary!
SOUTH AFRICA:39.2  Zaheer to de Villiers, FOUR!!, How did he manage to do that? de Villiers was looking to reverse sweep that, the ball was fuller and well outside off, gets a top edge as he reaches out for it and it goes over short fine leg, a couple of bounces and into the ropes, the rub of the green is going de Villiers' way
SOUTH AFRICA:39.1  Zaheer to Duminy, 1 run, superb delivery that, in-swinging yorker from Zaheer, Duminy gets the bat down, gets an under edge and the ball misses the leg stump and goes to the right of Dhoni, he sneaks a singleThe batting PP has been good for the Proteas until now, is there a wicket round the corner?
SOUTH AFRICA:38.6  Munaf Patel to de Villiers, no run, de Villiers makes room, looks to swing, does not connect
SOUTH AFRICA:38.5  Munaf Patel to de Villiers, FOUR!!, a low full toss and de Villiers has dispatched it between deep mid wicket and long on, boundaries are coming for the Proteas, and looks like ABD is their man if they have to entertain any chances of winning this
SOUTH AFRICA:38.4  Munaf Patel to Duminy, leg byes, 1 run, good comeback from Munaf Patel, fuller and angled in, Duminy looks to swipe it across, does not connect, the ball rolls off the pads to the off side
SOUTH AFRICA:38.3  Munaf Patel to Duminy, FOUR!!, Duminy drives it on the up, goes just over the fielder at point, Raina could not get there despite the leap, four more!
SOUTH AFRICA:38.2  Munaf Patel to de Villiers, 1 run, fuller delivery, de Villiers drills it down the ground to long off, he forgets that he has a runner and goes halfway down the track, does well to come back, Raina comes upto him and has a few words, all in good humour though, ABD won't get an extra run for doing that
SOUTH AFRICA:38.1  Munaf Patel to Duminy, 1 run, back of a length and angled in, Duminy turns it to the on side with soft handsMunaf Patel [6.0-0-25-0] is back into the attackSmith is signalling a thing or two from the dressing room, Hashim Amla is coming out as a runner. Probably AB de Villiers is hurt, remember, the throw from Yuvraj made him take evasive action and the bat tripped on the ground and that hit him very badly.Saurabh Somani, our man at the venue makes this insightful observation: SA are forcing India's hand by taking the batting power-play now. If it comes off, it'll be a master-stroke coz it would have used up Zak's overs. 
SOUTH AFRICA:37.6  Zaheer to Duminy, leg byes, 1 run, that's the problem the opposition faces when two quick runners are batting at the middle, it was a short of length delivery angled into the ribs of Duminy, he stood on his toes trying to fend it, hits him somewhere near the mid-riff and rolls to the on side, de Villiers is mighty quick, he does not want a dot ball at this stage, single taken
SOUTH AFRICA:37.5  Zaheer to de Villiers, 1 run, de Villiers slaps it cross batted towards mid on, the single could have been prevented but Munaf Patel misfields, that does not please Zaheer
SOUTH AFRICA:37.4  Zaheer to de Villiers, 2 runs, too full and de Villiers drives it straight down the ground, Bhajji from long off comes running to his right and dives full length, certainly saved two runs, the crowd erupt in joy
SOUTH AFRICA:37.3  Zaheer to Duminy, 1 run, that's as close as it can get!, Duminy was looking to hoick it across the line, gets the faintest of inside edges and the ball goes behind the stumps, de Villiers wants to snatch a single, Dhoni comes running in and hurls an under arm throw, does not hit the stumps and de Villiers is safe! Had there been no inside edge, Duminy was a goner
SOUTH AFRICA:37.2  Zaheer to de Villiers, 1 run, de Villiers is backing away for almost every delivery now, swipes across the line, the ball goes rolling along the ground towards deep mid wicket, Kohli is the man there
SOUTH AFRICA:37.1  Zaheer to Duminy, leg byes, 1 run, angled in, goes off the pads towards backward square leg, they sneak a single in the meantime
SOUTH AFRICA:36.6  Nehra to de Villiers, no run, de Villiers makes room again, Nehra follows him as he was looking to swing it across the line over mid wicket, some movement away from de Villiers as well, he misses and Dhoni collects it cleanly
SOUTH AFRICA:36.5  Nehra to de Villiers, FOUR!!, got to feel for the bowler, slower cutter and outside the leg stump, de Villiers was making room looking to heave it across, gets an inside edge that rolls to the left of Dhoni who couldn't get his hands to the ball despite an acrobatic dive, turning out to be a good over this
SOUTH AFRICA:36.4  Nehra to Duminy, 1 run, Duminy drops it down to the off side and sets off for a single, Yuvraj runs in from backward point and hurls in a throw which hits AB de Villiers and he trips down, a pat on the back from Yuvi to check whether de Villiers is ok, looks like he is!
SOUTH AFRICA:36.3  Nehra to Duminy, no run, similar length but close to the off stump, Duminy dabs it to point, the fielder is quick to run towards the ball, they don't take a single
SOUTH AFRICA:36.2  Nehra to Duminy, FOUR!!, delicate! poor ball too, back of a length and slightly outside off, Duminy just opens the face a tad and guides it down to the third man region, that will do for this over, they need not take any risk as yet
SOUTH AFRICA:36.1  Nehra to de Villiers, 1 run, de Villiers makes a bit of room and strokes it to wide mid off, he will only get a single, and all of a sudden, the crowd are back to their noisiest best!Ashish Nehra [7.0-0-39-0] is back into the attackFolks, the best bowler arrives, No I'm not talking about Nehra, I am talking about the batting powerplay! Remember the equation: 124 off 84 balls with 7 wickets in hand
SOUTH AFRICA:35.6  Zaheer to Duminy, no run, fuller again, good over this from Zaheer, Duminy drives it to the right of the bowler

It was well bowled at the first place, banged in short, well directed as well, Kallis pulled it to fine leg, for a moment it looked like Harbhajan would over run the ball, but he does well, hurls in a throw to Dhoni who was in front of the stumps, he had to turn within a split second to whip the bails off, Kallis was struggling, he was taking the longer route trying to avoid running on the danger area, he is caught inches short! Kallis run out (Harbhajan/Dhoni) 69(88) [4s-4] Zaheer to Kallis, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Third umpire has been called, has Kallis been run-out here?
SOUTH AFRICA:35.3  Zaheer to Kallis, no run, Well, Kallis moved a long way across looking to whip it behind square on the on side, he was trapped in front of the off stump, the ball landed on middle, didn't straighten enough, but hawk eye shows the ball was going on to hit off, but the 2.5 m rule comes into play, not-outEverything is in favour of Zak, but the distance is more than 2.5 mtsThe LBW appeal has been turned down, Zak has asked Dhoni to go for the review
SOUTH AFRICA:35.2  Zaheer to de Villiers, 1 run, drags the length back a little bit, de Villiers cuts it between point and cover, the sweeper will keep it down to just a single

SOUTH AFRICA:34.2  Yuvraj to de Villiers, FOUR!!, it was given a lot of air, de Villiers had too much time to clear the front leg and go over extra cover, just one bounce before it flies over the boundary ropes

Kallis is looking solid, while ABD looks to attack. The last 16 overs will be a thrilling one. Right, on that note, I, Sid V, have finished my comms for the day. I hand it to the wicket maniac, Ajith, who is on a roll.

SOUTH AFRICA:5.3  Nehra to Amla, FOUR!!, slashes hard, edges it but finds the boundary! It was back of a length, angled across, there was width on offer for Amla to go after it, gets a thickish outside edge, and third man was too wide to cut that down
SOUTH AFRICA:5.2  Nehra to Amla, no run, pitched up again, Amla drives, but there is Yusuf Pathan at a shortish point position, not exactly a short cover but he is a lot squarer, he jumps to take it cleanly
SOUTH AFRICA:5.1  Nehra to Amla, no run, that was a half-volley, deserved some thrashing, but cracks it straight to Kohli at extra cover, the off side is packed when Amla is on strike, Dhoni is giving no margin for error
SOUTH AFRICA:4.6  Zaheer to Smith, no run, gets it to go the other way round, in towards Smith, he goes back and pushes it towards mid on

SOUTH AFRICA:2.4  Zaheer to Smith, no run, that one kept low, the ball holds its line and Smith had to adjust and get his bat down, was on the backfoot, closes the face slightly and defends it to the on side
SOUTH AFRICA:2.3  Zaheer to Smith, no run, fuller and Smith was looking to drive that through the cover region, there is a Virat Kohli over there and the ball goes straight to him after bouncing just next to the 22 yard turfFor the records, Zaheer has dismissed Smith 12 times so far in all formats
SOUTH AFRICA:2.2  Zaheer to Smith, no run, much fuller on this occasion, Smith takes it from the off stump and works it to mid wicket, does not take a single

SOUTH AFRICA:1.3  Nehra to Smith, 2 runs, there was a bit of width on offer, Smith played it hard on the ground, the ball bounces high and just goes over a flying Yuvraj at point, Zaheer was at third man, he runs wide and keeps it down to two

SOUTH AFRICA:0.6  Zaheer to Amla, no run, off stumpish, the ball straightened a tad after pitching, well defended on the frontfoot towards cover, a good start for the Proteas, waiting for Smith v Zaheer contest though

SOUTH AFRICA:0.3  Zaheer to Amla, no run, not much pace on that delivery, pushed across Amla who decides to watch it through to the keeper, remember, we have seen some uneven bounce today, will that come into play soon?
SOUTH AFRICA:0.2  Zaheer to Amla, FOUR!!, poor delivery to follow it up, on a length and angling across, Amla stood on top of it, punched that right under his eyes, between point and cover the ball goes crashing into the fence, Amla is up and running
SOUTH AFRICA:0.1  Zaheer to Amla, no run, beautiful delivery first up, gets the ball to swing back into the right hander, had Amla missed that, it would have been a wicket first ball, but he gets his front leg across and works it to mid wicket, straight to the fielder thoughAmla and Smith are at the crease. Amla is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackSome fun here in the office regarding the effect that Ajith has when is on the keyboard doing the comm. Here are the stats: Srivathsa - first 37 overs - India 243/1.  Ajith - 38 - 48.4 - India - 243/1 to 296 all-out.  Way to go Ajith!MS Dhoni - ever the cool guy is having some stern words in the team huddle for his mates. He obviously would be disappointed with the last 10 overs of the Indian innings. Robin Jackman says that Nehra was getting nice swing during his warm-ups. The openers are walking out and it is the destroyer of the Indian innings with his manic keyboard skills - Ajith - to take you through the chase till the first drinks break.The chase: A stunning turn-around and an epic fight-back from South Africa. This group can't get any more exciting. The Proteas' themselves would be shocked at how the last 10 overs of the Indian innings has panned out. They have a great chance of chasing this down, especially when you consider this - average first innings score in a D/N game at the Jamtha is 316. Pommie said that even 350 was chasable during the start of the game.You just cannot afford to be complacent at any stage and India would have learnt that by now. In what was an amazing turnaround SA came back from being down and out to believing that they can chase down this target. Even after getting 296 it is SA who will be in a better frame of mind when they come out again and the Indian bowling which has been far from impressive so far have their task cut out. One just gets a feeling that this match will go down to the wire. Join us very shortly as we bring you the SA run chase.Well what more can you say about that man, he just keeps getting better with age like good wine and we sure are getting high on the sheer magic of it all. Ton No. 99 and and what a stage to get it in. Two magnificent tons against, arguably, the two biggest threats for India in this group and it looked like India were cruising at that stage with Sehwag and Sachin launching themselves savagely into the new ball and yet quite inexplicably India lost the plot completely soon after. The batting PP proved to be the undoing as India fell from 267 for 1 to 296 all out, Steyn ended up with five wickets after being carted all around in the initial overs.4
INDIA:48.4  Steyn to Munaf Patel, out Bowled!! Ladies and Gentlemen, Steyn has cleaned it up with a crushing yorker, bang on middle, in the blockhole, Munna's off stump knocked back and Steyn has taken his first 5 wicket haul in ODIs, and that is what I call 'The mother of all comebacks'.

INDIA:48.3  Steyn to Nehra, out Caught by Smith!! Nehra can't believe it, he struck it with such power that he would have expected the ball to crash into the extra cover boundary, but my friend, there are fielders inside the circle and you have to place it well too, a length ball, slightly less pace on that one, driven on the up with tremendous power, straight into Smith's mid-rift at extra cover, he takes it cleanly, and Dhoni at the other end is standing and just wondering. Nehra c Smith b Steyn 0(3) Steyn to Nehra, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

INDIA:46.5  Steyn to Harbhajan, out Bowled!! The World No. 1 bowler seems to be too good at the moment for Harbhajan, full and straight, in the blockhole, a little bit of reverse swing, Harbhajan cleared his front leg looking to swing it out of the park, but for that, he has to make contact first, which he doesn't, and a walk back to the pavilion is the price that he has to pay.

My fingers badly need a rest. Still no lunch, but I won't mind it one bit. I have had the privilege of watching this great knock by SRT. Will go and have a bite.

INDIA:35.2  Morne Morkel to Tendulkar, 1 run, he is content in doing it in singles as he drives one on the up to sweeper cover, Tendulkar won't be carried away by the crowd and play a big shot, he is too experienced for that

INDIA:34.1  Kallis to Tendulkar, no run, short of length delivery outside off, Tendulkar taps it close to the off side, wants a single, rightly sent back by Gambhir as the point man was rushing inA whiter and a harder ball has come out.

INDIA:33.2  Duminy to Gambhir, FOUR!!, one sighter from Duminy is enough for Gambhir and he immediately skips down the track before crisply going inside out over cover, one bounce over the ropes, that's the shot that Gambhir plays so well and he has done it again, he is one of the best players of spin in this Indian side

He has played so many ODI matches, that it's like eating Vada Pav back home in Mumbai. Smith would have had quite a few words to say to his mates during the drinks break.

He had lost his rag and has had a poor day with the ball. Can he get a few wickets for his side and recover lost ground?Sachin dropped catch: Coming back to that fabulous diving effort by AB when Sachin chipped one in the air, it brings back memories of a similar catch taken by James Kirtley of England when Ganguly had mistimed one in the Natwest Series played in 2002. It was not in the final, but in one of the league games of that fabulous series. Kirtley took it with his left hand diving full length at long on. Similar catch and today AB floored it. Maybe we can excuse him, for he is suffering from a bad back and that's the reason he is not keeping as well.

Bipasha is holding the Indian flag and cheering loudly.Robin Jackman on air: My wife just called me and asked me whether this was a highlights package!It's time for Drinks.

Runs are coming in a deluge and there seems to be no stopping the bleeding. Both have reached their fifties and look good for more. Time for me (Srivathsa) to take a mini-breather and I'm not handing over the comm duties to anyone. The South African team are in a huddle and Smith has had plenty to say. He needs to.

INDIA:9.1  Steyn to Sehwag, 1 run, Sehwag has calmed down after a blistering start, gently uses the pace of Steyn and then glides it down with an open face to third manDale Steyn [3.0-0-24-0] is back into the attackSteyn is back for another burst! Change of ends. Will there be any change in fortunes for him? No slips and a couple of short covers in place.
INDIA:8.6  Kallis to Sehwag, 1 run, good length delivery outside off, Sehwag stays back and opens the face of the bat to run it down to third man, retains the strike with that run
INDIA:8.5  Kallis to Tendulkar, 1 run, As Sanjay on air says, the Proteas are unlike them in the field today, an unnecessary throw from Amla at Sehwag's end gives away an extra run, Sehwag was already in his crease, the richochet takes the ball to sweeper cover
INDIA:8.4  Kallis to Tendulkar, no run, short delivery and it is outside off, Tendulkar drops everything in his way and lets it go, swaying out of the line
INDIA:8.3  Kallis to Sehwag, 1 run, played with an open face from Sehwag to third man, it was outside off and he used the angle to guide it down
INDIA:8.2  Kallis to Tendulkar, 3 runs, Tendulkar is at it again, this time, leaning into the forward punch on the up, opens the face of the bat to get it in the gap and only a desperate slide from Botha saves a run, he ran all the way and pulled it back
INDIA:8.1  Kallis to Sehwag, 1 run, back of a length outside off, glided down with an open face to third man
INDIA:7.6  Morne Morkel to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, I'm already tired, of describing these magnificent shots, but this one has to be one of the shots of the tournament. Not of this match. Morne Morkel has been too full this over and Tendulkar plays the picture perfect straight drive and even before Morne Morkel bent down the ball had crossed the ropes, you can't get much straighter than that, a collective gasp of admiration from my colleagues here in the office, something for the photographers, wonderful stuff from Tendulkar
INDIA:7.5  Morne Morkel to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, Tendulkar will play in an orthodox manner, unlike Sehwag who is all muscle, but when it is there to be hit, Tendulkar will too play it on the rise and cream it to the fence, short of length outside off, driven uppishly on the up past cover, it was not catchable at all as it went well over the man
INDIA:7.4  Morne Morkel to Tendulkar, no run, Tendulkar comes on the frontfoot and covers the off stump, before wristing it to mid on, straight to the fielder

INDIA:7.2  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, FOUR!!, no room for error when you are bowling to Sehwag, especially when it is such a good wicket, regulation half volley on off and middle, Sehwag on drove with power and to the left of Robbie at mid on, there is no grace or silken touch with Sehwag, only raw power and I sometimes feel for the ball, good that it is a non-living thing!
INDIA:7.1  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, short of length and rising into the hips, Sehwag defends it with a high back-lift, nicely done
INDIA:6.6  Kallis to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, Tendulkar knows that the short fine is up and he also knows that Kallis will bowl it on a short of length, so he shuffles across a tad, swivels before getting a bit of bat on it to send it scurrying to the fence, India are off to a flier and the Nagpur crowd are loving this to bits
INDIA:6.5  Kallis to Sehwag, 1 run, short of length outside off, chopped with an open face as Sehwag stood beside the line to play it down to third man
INDIA:6.4  Kallis to Sehwag, FOUR!!, the Indians are off to a rollicking start, short delivery and Sehwag did not time the pull as well as he would've liked to, good sharp bouncer, that rose on Sehwag, who top edged the pull, no one in the deep and the ball will roll away to the fence
INDIA:6.3  Kallis to Sehwag, no run, cutting back in off the seam, lands on off and cramps up Sehwag for room, Sehwag pushes it with a full face to mid on
INDIA:6.2  Kallis to Sehwag, 2 runs, this one moves in to middle and leg, Sehwag whips it wide of mid wicket, an easy couple of runs
INDIA:6.1  Kallis to Sehwag, no run, and that's what he does, short of length on middle, Sehwag punches it off the backfoot to mid onJacques Kallis, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackGood move from Smith to bring in Kallis! He won't give Sehwag or Tendulkar any width. He will bowl it on a back of a length and tuck up the batsmen.
INDIA:5.6  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, 1 run, Sehwag comes on the frontfoot and drives it on the up, it was in the air, but well over the cover fielder, there is a sweeper cover in place, only a single, Sehwag retains the strike with that run
INDIA:5.5  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, FOUR!!, poor ball and rightly hit away for 4 by Sehwag, short, wide and outside off, slashed hard and third man gave up the chase quickly, it flew off the bat and Ravi Shaz brings out his trade-mark cliche: 'That went off the bat like a tracer bullet!'
INDIA:5.4  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, solid forward push to cover, straight to the fielder
INDIA:5.3  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, FOUR!!, half volley and driven hard past Morne Morkel, he bent down to get his left hand but the ball had already raced past him, tremendous off drive, it was there to be hit and Sehwag crashed it, Sehwag is taking on the Proteas here
INDIA:5.2  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, Ripper, to come back from Morne Morkel, gets this straighten just past the hanging blade of Sehwag, it landed on off and held it's line to fly past the edge, not far away from the 1st wicket was Morne Morkel that time, magnificent bowling
INDIA:5.1  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, FOUR!!, CRACK of DOOM! Morne Morkel will feel absolutely gutted that it has gone to the fence, pacy short of length delivery outside off, Sehwag stood tall, met the ball on the top of the bounce and hammered it on the rise past the infield, not a muscle moved from the Proteas' side, too good from Sehwag, only he could have done that with such power and timing
INDIA:4.6  Steyn to Tendulkar, no run, Tendulkar does a Sehwag, in leaving the ball that is, short and Tendulkar arches his back and lets it go
INDIA:4.5  Steyn to Sehwag, 1 run, the trade-mark Sehwag clip, on the leg stump, with one leg up in the air, he whips it to long leg
INDIA:4.4  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, Steyn drops it short, Sehwag is anticipating the short one, hangs back, it does not rise that much and he drops his bat and the gloves before letting it go through
INDIA:4.3  Steyn to Sehwag, FOUR!!, Morkel had no chance, even if he was another 10 feet tall, he would not have gotten a hand to that, ferociously upper cut to the right and it flew past a desperate diving lunge from Morkel at third man, almost went all the way, one bounce over the ropes
INDIA:4.2  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, solid backfoot defence, picture perfect, standing tall and defending it with a full face, a high front elbow to boot as well
INDIA:4.1  Steyn to Tendulkar, 1 run, short of length on middle, Tendulkar closes the face of the bat and tucks it well down to fine leg, Tendulkar turned the wrists at the correct time and made sure he placed it well
INDIA:3.6  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, Morne Morkel is really bowling well and keeping the pressure on Sehwag, nothing to work with for him, again pushed from the crease to cover, end of a tight over
INDIA:3.5  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, short of length and outside off, Sehwag shows the full face of the bat, stands tall and punches it off the backfoot to cover
INDIA:3.4  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, fullish and draws Sehwag onto the front-foot, Sehwag drives well, but finds cover, straight to the fielder
INDIA:3.3  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, Morne Morkel knows that he can get Sehwag out with that delivery, in the corridor of uncertainty, and inviting the drive, Sehwag though knows that he has already given one chance, decides to shoulder arms
INDIA:3.2  Morne Morkel to Tendulkar, 1 run, well bowled, Tendulkar is shuffling across a lot even before the ball was bowled, Morne Morkel slipped in the slower bouncer, Tendulkar swung hard, it hit the top part of the bat and lobbed near mid wicket, only a single, Tendulkar isn't happy with himself, has a wry grin on his face
INDIA:3.2  Morne Morkel to Tendulkar, no ball, 2 runs, Tendulkar wants the strike for the free-hit and hares back for the 2nd, it was square driven uppishly past point, the quick outfield made sure that it ran quickly to Kallis at third man, he slides to his right to keep it to a couple
INDIA:3.1  Morne Morkel to Tendulkar, no run, short of length on off stump, Tendulkar closes the face of the bat and turns it to square leg
INDIA:2.6  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, pitches on middle and moves in to hit Sehwag on the pad, it was sliding down leg, Steyn wants the review to be taken, Smith walks up to him and says, nothing doing, if they had gone for it, they would have lost it, Steyn is already losing his rag here, Smith has to have a few words and calm him down
INDIA:2.5  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, punched off the backfoot to mid off
INDIA:2.5  Steyn to Sehwag, 5 wides, horrid delivery and van Wyk had no chance, fired well down leg and moving further away, Smith looks at Steyn and suggests as if to say ' what is happening out here'?
INDIA:2.4  Steyn to Sehwag, FOUR!!, leg stumpish, on the pads, Sehwag won't miss out on those, flicked up and over square leg, a couple of bounces and over the ropes, easily done by Sehwag
INDIA:2.3  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, short delivery and Sehwag does well to drop everything and sway out of the line, lets it go
INDIA:2.2  Steyn to Tendulkar, 5 runs, poor backing up from the man at cover, gifts Tendulkar 5, it was pushed to the left of mid off, Botha fired at the stumps, the man at cover over-ran the ball and the other man at cover point could not haul it back in too, ordinary stuff from the Proteas, pressure, pressure!
INDIA:2.1  Steyn to Tendulkar, no run, pitched up and some away movement, Tendulkar gets forward and pushes it with a full face to cover, covered the swing well thereSteyn v Tendulkar - what a battle! An epic one too! The contest that they had in the third test at Cape Town in the first dig was one for the ages. Will it continue today?
INDIA:1.6  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, Sehwag comes on the frontfoot and times that sweetly, with a full face of the bat
INDIA:1.5  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, good lines these, back of a length and outside off, lifting from that length, Sehwag shoulders arms
INDIA:1.4  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, regulation leave from Sehwag as he leaves a similar delivery alone
INDIA:1.3  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, FOUR!!, is van Wyk a Kamran Akmal in disguise?, what a let-off for Sehwag and India, the perfect delivery produces the edge, that's how Morne Morkel got Sehwag out in the third test at Cape Town in the 2nd innings, short of length outside off, rising from that area, Sehwag thinks he can get away by punching it on the up, a little seam movement away, catches the edge and van Wyk had to move to his right to grab a dolly and Smith who is standing at a widish slip position leave it to each other, in the end, it goes in between both of them, similar to the one Kamran let go off Rossco the other day, will Sehwag make it count? that's the big question
INDIA:1.2  Morne Morkel to Sehwag, no run, rising viciously from a back of a length area, it was outside off, and van Wyk takes it well over his head
INDIA:1.1  Morne Morkel to Tendulkar, 1 run, again a beautiful stop by Botha, what a shot by Tendulkar though, punched on the up and Botha had to put in the full length dive to his left to save 3 runs, Tendulkar is off the mark and the crowd are kicking and aliveMorne Morkel will share the new ballMorkel will get it to bounce on any pitch and here he comes in to Sachin.
INDIA:0.6  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, beaten, 2nd time that Steyn has got one to move away a tad in the air and then off the seam as Sehwag went after it without too much footwork, tried to punch it on the up and the ball moved past the edge, an eventful first over comes to an end
INDIA:0.5  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, wonderful diving stop by Botha to his left at mid off, it was four all the way, till Botha flung himself full length, driven powerfully on the up too by Sehwag
INDIA:0.4  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, pitched up and moving away outside off, left alone
INDIA:0.3  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, beautiful delivery, Sehwag was trying to work that to leg, it pitched on off and straightened a tad, Sehwag was comprehensively beaten, not far away from the off peg
INDIA:0.2  Steyn to Sehwag, no run, muted appeal from Steyn, sliding down leg and catches Sehwag's pad
INDIA:0.1  Steyn to Sehwag, FOUR!!, 5 in 5, Shafiul Islam, James Anderson, Boyd Rankin, Bukhari and now Steyn. All have faced the wrath of Sehwag, if it is there in the slot, it will go, fullish and on off stump, Sehwag deliberately chips it up and over mid on, it was there to be hit, Sehwag covered the swing and hit it, the crowd are clearing their throatsInteresting stat: Sehwag has hit all the 4 opening balls in the 4 matches that he has faced in this WC to the boundary. Will he make it 5 in 5?Sehwag and Tendulkar are at the crease. Sehwag is on strike. Steyn will open the attackThe Nagpur crowd are buzzing and not a single seat is empty. The familiar opening faces of Sehwag and Tendulkar are out there. Sehwag with eyes closed says a little prayer as Tendulkar adjusts his pads and gloves. Then they punch each others' gloves and walk to the centre. Dale Steyn v Tendulkar and Morne Morkel v Sehwag will be a sight to savor today. Pommie on air tells us that even if you score 350, it definitely is chasable.Lots of South Africans in the crowd too - which is always great to see. The Amla look-alike gang - with fake beards is there too and singing along to their national anthem - which I'm guessing is in Afrikaans. Morne van Wyk with his hand over his heart and eyes closed is reciting it. As is AB. Lots of cheers as their national anthem ends. The Indian anthem is up next. Loud roars as the home anthem is done.Thanks Ajith! India v South Africa - one hell of a game. We witnessed a magnificent test series when India played the Proteas. No one gave an inch away and it was one riveting series. Even the ODI series was not decided till the last game. Yusuf Pathan came of age with a stunning hundred and there were many goose-bump moments in that series.Dhoni did mention at the toss that they are going in with 3 seamers and two spinners. Good to know that he is considering Yuvraj as a regular spinner. It is a pressure game, the wicket won't change much during the course of the game and we are in for a cracker of a contest. Well, here they come for the anthems, the expressions on the faces of the players and the crowd tell us what it means to them to be listening to and singing their anthems with such pride. Alright, on public demand, this is Ajith handing over commentary duties to Srivathsa. Let's hope we are in for a good game.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Morne van Wyk(w), Johan Botha, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Morne MorkelIndia (Playing XI): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Ashish NehraSmith: We would have batted as well. We would have played some good cricket, but didn't cross the line against England. It is a real good game, we have been preparing for one whole week. Botha comes in place of Tahir, that's the only change.Dhoni: We have decided to bat first, we want to put runs on board and defend it. The Nagpur wicket is very good for the batsmen, there is a bit of bounce and swing for bowlers, it will be a good wicket later on. It is a big game for us, being unbeaten in the tournament is history. Turning up and doing what we do the best is the important thing. Munaf Patel comes in place of Chawla.India have won the toss and elected to batThe captains are out for the toss, let's see what happens. Ravi Shastri is all set.Pitch report: The surface is hard, well rolled in. Does not look all that dry except in certain areas. Won't be too helpful for the bowlers, it will be a terrific wicket to bat on feels Sourav Ganguly.Yuvraj Singh: I am very happy that I am getting those Man of the Match awards. Glad that my bowling is paying off, and batting in tough situations has worked for me. I like batting in such pressure situations. (Listening to the crowd go berserk) I guess Sachin is entering the ground.Saurabh Somani who is at the venue says, "SA doing some brisk hitting-the-stumps drills. Fans chanting 'Sachin, Sachin'. India not bothered with cricket stuff, they are playing football. Both teams keeping cards hugged to their chests. Tahir not bowling for SA, but might play. Nobody from Ind bowling, who knows who'll play?"Weather report: The temperature may go up to 37 degrees, it is a bright and a sunny day at Nagpur. Clear skies, no rain whatsoever!Another big day in the 2011 World Cup, the hosts India lock horns with South Africa at Nagpur, the Orange City. After what we saw yesterday, with Bangladesh winning against England in a thriller, Group B is still wide open and South Africa would want nothing less than a win. India, on the other hand, are one of the only two teams who haven't lost a single game in the tournament until now. Their bowling has been a bit of a conern, but will they step up when it really matters? Hello folks, a warm welcome to the live coverage of the same. This is Ajith bringing you all the action along with Sid V, Pradeep and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be right back.by Saurabh SomaniWhen the schedule for the 2011 World Cup was drawn up, of the many possibly enticing clashes it had to offer, this was the one that was undoubtedly the most looked forward to. After all it had everything: the best batsman in the world on one side, and the best bowler in the world on the other. The most intimidating batting line-up on one side versus the best bowling-fielding combination on the other.
The last time these two sides played each other, there was a Test series that saw epic battles followed by an ODI series that sparkled intermittently even though India did not have their big names. These last time South Africa played in India, the two sides emerged with honours even in the Test series, while Sachin Tendulkar smashed 200 in the ODI series that followed. These two sides do not go toe-to-toe on a cricket field without producing something memorable.India: Whether they are chasing or setting a target, India will need their openers to give them a very good start. That is the surest way India have of grabbing the initiative and keeping it with them. If the South African bowlers make early inroads, they will quickly start to dictate terms, and when you have Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel doing the dictating, batting will get very difficult indeed. However, if the opening stand clicks for India, it will ease the way for all the other batsmen to follow. First, it is a given that if Tendulkar and Sehwag bat for any length of time together, the score-board will be galloping, and second if Sehwag in particular stays for a while he will have hit South Africa's bowlers off their lengths and will have made it much easier for the batsmen who follow to continue dominating.
Dhoni has repeated that there is nothing much that can be done with the fielding, and he'll be happy as long as India don't drop catches in the field. However, there is something that can be done for the other worrisome part for India: the bowling. Piyush Chawla has had his chances and it is time for him to make way for R Ashwin. Dhoni said that the reason Chawla was persisted with was to give him confidence and keep him mentally strong. First of all, the cricket World Cup is not the place where you groom players or experiment - the guys picked in the squad should have had enough battle-hardening, else they shouldn't be in the squad. Second, it makes no sense to hold Ashwin back as a 'surprise weapon' as some are conjecturing is the case. Ashwin has played in the IPL regularly, and the IPL is hardly a back-water, little-known cricket tournament. As such, there is no 'surprise' tag to Ashwin, and it doesn't make sense to hold him back.South Africa: For a team that has had five out of six outstanding innings, South Africa are facing considerably more questions than would initially seem warranted for one bad outing with the bat. However, the manner of the batting capitulation is what has set tongues wagging and brought in the word that every South African must detest: choke. However, it cannot be ignored that against the West Indies and Netherlands, South Africa were inch perfect and completely dominant. Their bowlers continued that trend against England only for the batsmen to stuff it up.
South Africa's principal worry is a top-heavy batting line-up. It can be justifiably argued that when the top is heavy with the likes of Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers, you won't really suffer if your lower middle order doesn't pack the same punch, and in most cases it would be true. However, as South Africa found to their cost against England, on the rare occasion that the top order fails, South Africa's batting is exposed. Thus South Africa need to ensure that they don't allow the Indians to make early inroads into their batting.
The bowling has presented few worries, and even if the talented Imran Tahir is unavailable, South Africa have Johan Botha who can step in. Tahir brought an extra dimension to their attack, but Botha has been an effective limited overs bowler in his own right, and is also a useful batsman. The fielding is where South Africa will look to win the match against India, for its the one facet in which they have unquestioned superiority.Face off: Pacers versus Openers:There are two key clashes that will occur at the start of each innings: Dale Steyn vs Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan vs Graeme Smith.
The winner of the Sehwag-Steyn battle may very well end up winning the match for his team. Sehwag has so far faced 23 balls off Steyn across four ODIs. He has scored 26 runs off those and been dismissed once. Either way, it's too few numbers to go on, and none of them has established any clear domination over the other.
On the other hand Zaheer Khan has established a very clear dominance over Graeme Smith. This contest may not be in the league of the first one in terms of decisiveness for the match, but it is a fascinating one nonetheless. In 80 balls bowled by Zaheer to Smith in ODIs, Smith has scored just 44 runs and been dismissed 5 times. However, Smith's stats are a little better when more recent numbers are taken. Since December 2006, Smith has faced 66 balls from Zaheer, scoring 40 runs off them and being dismissed just once. Those numbers are still leaning towards Zaheer, but they suggest that of late, Smith has been able to overcome his weakness against the Indian spearhead to some extent.Head to Head:India have never beaten South Africa in a World Cup. They met twice - in 1992 and 1999 - and lost both times. Overall, South Africa have won 39 matches to India's 24, with 6 no results.Teams:India (From): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Piyush Chawla, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Ravichandran Ashwin, Munaf Patel, Suresh Raina, S SreesanthSouth Africa (From): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(w), Faf du Plessis, Jean-Paul Duminy, Johan Botha, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Imran Tahir, Morne van Wyk, Wayne Parnell, Colin IngramLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
