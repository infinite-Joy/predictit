ZIMBABWE:36.6 36.6Yasir Shah to Panyangara, out Caught by Imad Wasim!! That wraps up the misery for Zimbabwe. Yasir Shah finishes with six. An ordinary delivery to cap off an ordinary show with the bat. Dragged down short, slowish as well. Begging to be carted away but such has been the day for the home team. Panyangara only gets some glove on the attempted pull and the ball pops up straight to second slip off his pads. Panyangara c Imad Wasim b Yasir Shah 4(6) [4s-1]Yasir Shah to Panyangara, THATS OUT!!

ZIMBABWE:35.5 Shoaib Malik to Panyangara, no run, Panyangara just wants to get through with it now. Fullish delivery on middle and he plays a standing sweep. Would have been a surprise had he connected. He is hit on the front pad but the turn would have taken it down
ZIMBABWE:35.4 Shoaib Malik to Panyangara, no run, a bit slower on middle and leg, Panyangara clips it with the turn to mid-wicket
ZIMBABWE:35.3 Shoaib Malik to John Nyumbu, 1 run, flat and quick outside off, Nyumbu mistimes his cut towards coverJohn Nyumbu, right handed bat, comes to the crease
ZIMBABWE:35.2 Shoaib Malik to Cremer, out Lbw!! "Howzaaaaaaaaaat (more like an Aaaaaaaaaaa)", is the cry from the bowler and the umpire raises the finger. The shot really was a tame attempt at a reverse-sweep. He flashed his cards too early and Malik bowls it very slow on the stumps, Cremer is ages early into the shot and is through with it before the ball arrives, wears it on the thigh pad. Might have just about clipped the leg stump. Cremer lbw b Shoaib Malik 2(4)Shoaib Malik to Cremer, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!

ZIMBABWE:34.5 Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, out Caught by Rizwan!! Can this guy stop taking five-fors? What a bowler he is turning out to be. Not that Zimbabwe are making it very difficult for him. A lot of air given on this delivery which drifts in around off stump before turning away, Chigumbura was looking to work it through the on-side but closes the bat face too early. The leading edge goes straight into the lap of Rizwan at cover. Chigumbura c Rizwan b Yasir Shah 22(30) [4s-2]Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:34.4 Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, no run, nice and slow on the stumps, Chigumbura defends

ZIMBABWE:34.2 Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, FOUR, make that two pearls now. Well flighted delivery turning away on a length across off, Chigumbura might have just opened the face of the bat and guided it wide of slip, at least that's what he'll say. The ball runs away to the ad cushions
ZIMBABWE:34.1 Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, FOUR, like a pearl in the ocean, Chigumbura finds the fence. Loopy delivery which was very full just outside off, Chigumbura moves his front leg out of the way and creams the extra-cover drive

ZIMBABWE:33.2 Shoaib Malik to Luke Jongwe, out Lbw!! The wheels are coming off. Just no breaking the cobwebs which the spinners have put on. A bit slower this time from Malik, pitched around off stump from round the wicket and spun back in sharply, Jongwe was playing for the angle and is beaten on the inside edge. The height was fine, so was the line. End result: You are on your way son. Luke Jongwe lbw b Shoaib Malik 0(5)Shoaib Malik to Luke Jongwe, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
ZIMBABWE:33.1 Shoaib Malik to Chigumbura, 1 run, a bit of hesitation in the running but Chigumbura is sent back in time. He came down the track and flicked this one just wide of deep mid-wicket, the call was for two and Chigumbura came halfway down as well. A good call from Jongwe sees him get back in time
ZIMBABWE:32.6 Yasir Shah to Luke Jongwe, no run, advances but doesn't quite get to the pitch, the ball grips the surface and takes the outside half of the bat before rolling away into the off-side

ZIMBABWE:32.2 Yasir Shah to Mutumbami, out Caught by Hafeez!! Mohammad Hafeez, Sir, take a bow! The ball was dying and travelling low to his right, he sticks out his right hand on the dive and when he gets up, he is amazed to find the ball in the middle of his palm. Yasir Shah is crippling Zimbabwe. Well flighted leg break around off stump, Mutumbami just looks to poke at it with an open face, a very tame attempt. The ball turns and takes the outside edge. The rest is history. Mutumbami c Hafeez b Yasir Shah 3(5)Yasir Shah to Mutumbami, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
ZIMBABWE:32.1 Yasir Shah to Chigumbura, 1 run, slowish, shortish delivery on the stumps, punched down to long-on. Could have so easily rocked back and pulled it out of the ground. Intent?

ZIMBABWE:30.2 Yasir Shah to S Raza, out Caught by Shoaib Malik!! All downhill for the men in Red. Yasir Shah continues to bamboozle batsmen. Well tossed up leg-break which was above the batsman's eye-line, Raza just can't resist the temptation. He is down the track in a flash, nearly swings off his feet in looking for a wild slog (turned a full 360 degree as well), the ball grips and takes a thick outside edge. Spoons up to short third man. Malik won't drop that even if you wake him up at 3 am. S Raza c Shoaib Malik b Yasir Shah 19(40) [4s-1]Yasir Shah to S Raza, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

ZIMBABWE:25.3 Shoaib Malik to Sean Williams, out Bowled!! Oh no, no, no. Huge, this is a huge moment in the match. Williams is absolutely disgusted with himself. Swings the bat hard through the air in frustration. It was a nicely flighted delivery perhaps a bit too full to be sweeping. Williams goes through with it anyway and tries to connect it hard. The ball drifts in with the angle, grips the pitch beating the outside edge and clips the top of middle and off. Actually the length was there to be sweeping, just got deceived by the turn.

ZIMBABWE:8.1 Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, out Lbw!! And do we need to take another look at that? That's a quicker one from the left-armer, back of a length and hurries onto the right hander who plays back to it, misses the line and perhaps that was clipping the leg stump, never a great idea to be rooted to the crease and he pays for the price for it, Imad draws first blood. Chibhabha lbw b Imad Wasim 12(27) [4s-2]Imad Wasim to Chibhabha, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Imad Wasim, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack

ZIMBABWE:5.6 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, an appeal for lbw but the umpire is not amused. Good length ball angling in on middle and leg, Chibhabha fails to work it away into the on-side and wears it on the pad, the angle though was taking it down leg
ZIMBABWE:5.5 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, FOUR, lovely shot! Yamin bowls a full delivery but offers enough width to Chibhabha to latch onto it. He plants his front foot across and drives it sweetly through the extra cover region for a boundary
ZIMBABWE:5.4 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, angling in from just outside off, Chibhabha was cramped for room as he looks to force it through the off-side, can only knock it towards the cover region

ZIMBABWE:5.1 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, Chibhabha will be livid with himself for missing out on a half volley. It was on a driving length outside off, Chibhabha made a good connection as well but couldn't beat the man at cover-point
ZIMBABWE:4.6 Irfan to Chari, no run, back of a length delivery on the stumps, may have been the slower ball as well. Chari jumps and gently drops it into the off-side with soft hands

ZIMBABWE:3.6 Aamer Yamin to Chibhabha, no run, another one that's bowled well wide outside off and short enough for Chibhabha to cut it, he can only mistime it towards backward point though and doesn't look too happy with himself after playing that shot

Bowls it well wide outside off, the tramline made it easy for the umpire to exercise his armsAamer Yamin, right-arm medium, comes into the attackThe Pakistani debutant, Aamer Yamin, will share the attack with Irfan. There's a slip in place for him.

ZIMBABWE:0.2 Irfan to Chari, no run, angling away well outside off, Chari lets it go
ZIMBABWE:0.1 Irfan to Chari, no run, Irfan starts with a fuller one first up. Chari comes on the front foot to drive, but was beaten for pace. The ball strikes the pad first, there was half an lbw appeal from the Pakistani players but the ball pitched outside legChari and Chibhabha are at the crease. Chari is on strike. Irfan will open the attackThe players are out in the middle. Mohammad Irfan will open the proceedings with the ball. The debutant, Brian Chari, will be on strike first up. There are two slips in place. Here we go then...Azhar Ali, Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez were all tied down by the able pace duo and in the end, gifted their wickets away. Spinners, Nyumbu and Williams bowled tidy spells. Unfortunately, the hosts lost their way a bit in the slog overs. Other than Nyumbu dropping a catch to give Azhar a reprieve, Zimbabwe's fielding too was largely on the money. The wicket is on the slower side and in the recent past, one has seen Zimbabwe struggle in chasing down targets. So it should be interesting to see their approach with the bat. Take a break and join us back in a while.Pakistan recovered from a precarious position at 35 for 3 to post a challenging total on the board. It was Sarfraz Ahmed and Shoaib Malik, who initially propped up their innings by twinning caution with aggression. Mohammad Rizwan and Imad Wasim then stitched a sparkling century stand to calm down the nerves in the dressing room. Rizwan and Wasim also went on to crack fifties. Earlier in the day, Panyangara and Jongwe bowled with discipline to rock the visitors' innings up front. 4
PAKISTAN:49.6 Panyangara to Rizwan, SIX, what a way to finish! Rizwan, you beauty. He is down the track in a flash, gets a nice juicy full toss and clubs it down the ground. Mid-on was up in the ring but wouldn't have mattered as he cleared the ropes
PAKISTAN:49.5 Panyangara to Aamer Yamin, 1 run, fuller length delivery outside off, Yamin looks for an expansive cover-drive but drags it off the inside half of the bat to mid-onAamer Yamin, right handed bat, comes to the crease
PAKISTAN:49.5 Panyangara to Rizwan, wide, out Imad Wasim Run Out!! Massive comedy of errors. Wide yorker outside off, Rizwan misses and the umpire signals a wide. The keeper under-arms it at the striker's end but misses the stumps. The ball stops after hitting Rizwan's foot. Then the non-striker calls through for the single, the keeper hurtles towards the ball and kicks it back on to the stumps. Wasim is caught short of the crease. Imad Wasim run out (Mutumbami) 61(61) [4s-5]Panyangara to Rizwan, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!
PAKISTAN:49.4 Panyangara to Rizwan, FOUR, low full toss outside off, Rizwan has manhandled it over a leaping mid-on. Was deceived by the lack of pace as it looked like a slower delivery but still went through with the slog, his bottom hand came off as well but the muscle was enough to beat the fielder
PAKISTAN:49.3 Panyangara to Rizwan, leg byes, FOUR, lucky, lucky but Pakistan will grab whatever they can get their hands on. Panyangara is so unlucky. What can you do more than this? Found the yorker outside off, Rizwan moves across looking to slog it on-side but misses and the ball runs away off the boot fine of third man
PAKISTAN:49.2 Panyangara to Imad Wasim, 1 run, another very full delivery outside off, Wasim squeezes the drive through the covers

PAKISTAN:49.1 Panyangara to Imad Wasim, FOUR, fraction fuller than a good length outside off, Wasim moves across and laps it over short fine leg. Nearly cleared the ropes as well, such was the timing
PAKISTAN:48.6 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, 1 run, wow, Jongwe was impressive in this over. Bowls another yorker in the blockhole outside off after seeing the batsman move across, don't know why Wasim tries to play the sweep. Needless to say he misses, but so does the keeper. The umpire signalled it as runs, might have been a feather
PAKISTAN:48.5 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, no run, another brilliant yorker outside off, Wasim was moving well across but just fails to get the bat down in time
PAKISTAN:48.4 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, 2 runs, that would go down as 4 runs saved, rather than a dropped catch. Bouncer around off, Wasim miscues his pull shot off the top half of the bat, Cremer moves back at deep mid-wicket, catches it comfortably but realizes that the momentum was taking him over the rope. He releases the ball but he went too far back and could not recover in time to take it on the second attempt
PAKISTAN:48.3 Luke Jongwe to Rizwan, 1 run, short delivery outside off, Rizwans mistimes his pull through mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:48.2 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, 1 run, excellent stuff. Another bang-on yorker outside off, Wasim squeezes the drive to long-off
PAKISTAN:48.2 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, wide, this time the arms go up much to the relief of Wasim. He had moved well across outside off, the ball was yorker length well outside off
PAKISTAN:48.1 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, no run, in the blockhole well wide of off, Wasim lets it go perhaps expecting the wide call. The umpire's arms remain tucked to his body

PAKISTAN:47.5 Panyangara to Imad Wasim, FOUR, well played sir. The percentage of improvisations coming off for this duo has been very impressive. Low full toss outside off, Wasim gets in position early and just helps the reverse dab fine of short third man
PAKISTAN:47.4 Panyangara to Rizwan, 1 run, low full toss on off stump, don't know what Rizwan was trying to do. Just chips it down the ground. Luckily, he didn't time it well enough and it goes on the bounce to long-on
PAKISTAN:47.4 Panyangara to Rizwan, wide, oh, that's a shocker. Forget tramlines, it's out of the pitch outside off
PAKISTAN:47.3 Panyangara to Rizwan, 2 runs, the Zimbabwean bowlers are using the short ball to good effect. Rizwan was making room and was a touch surprised. Is hurried in the pull but sends it along the ground wide of fine leg
PAKISTAN:47.2 Panyangara to Imad Wasim, 1 run, a direct-hit and Wasim would have been on his bike. Fuller length delivery outside off, Wasim clubs it straight to mid-off and sets off. Luckily for him, the fielder misses
PAKISTAN:47.1 Panyangara to Imad Wasim, FOUR, dear me. You've got to lift yourselves here Zimbabwe. They are allowing the game to drift in these final stages. This time a dolly goes down. Wasim was surprised by the short delivery and top edges his rushed pull. The ball lobs wide of long-on, the fielder covers the ground and gets to it with both hands but just cannot hold on
PAKISTAN:46.6 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, 1 run, in the blockhole at last. This one might have been a wide as well if Wasim was not so anxious in reaching out and digging it out to the off-side
PAKISTAN:46.5 Luke Jongwe to Rizwan, 1 run, superb change of pace. Just what is required at the death. Rizwan was giving the charge and making room while doing so, had to reach out in the end and just about manages to tamely push it to cover
PAKISTAN:46.4 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, 1 run, another full toss goes begging. Angling away outside off, Wasim creams it down to long-off
PAKISTAN:46.3 Luke Jongwe to Rizwan, 1 run, slower bouncer outside off stump, Rizwan sees it early, waits on the back foot and pulls it through mid-wicket. Couldn't get the timing right as he was beaten for the lack of pace
PAKISTAN:46.2 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, 1 run, with square leg up in the ring, Wasim moves across looking to premeditate the sweep past him. It was a very full delivery angling away outside off, the batsman mistimes the shot and sends it all along the carpet to the fielder
PAKISTAN:46.1 Luke Jongwe to Rizwan, 1 run, all full tosses these and these batsmen should be doing much better with them. This one was drifting down leg, Rizwan just gently flicks it through mid-wicketLuke Jongwe [7.0-1-30-1] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:45.6 Panyangara to Rizwan, 1 run, Rizwan was moving leg side and Panyangara followed him with a low full toss. The batsman is cramped for room and can only helplessly flick it down to long-on
PAKISTAN:45.5 Panyangara to Rizwan, 2 runs, low full toss angling in on middle, Rizwan whips it wide of long-on, a fumble there enables the batsmen to jog back for the second
PAKISTAN:45.4 Panyangara to Rizwan, FOUR, Rizwan can do no wrong at the moment. Just picking his spots nicely. Moved into position early for the lap, gets it on a good length and just helps it over short fine
PAKISTAN:45.3 Panyangara to Imad Wasim, 1 run, hoho, Wasim was all in readiness to club this out of the park. Seeing him clear his front leg and make room, Panyangara bowls a short one, Wasim adjusts and somehow carves out a pull wide of long-on
PAKISTAN:45.2 Panyangara to Rizwan, 1 run, a back of a length off-cutter around middle and leg, Rizwan goes on the backfoot and tucks it gently through the on-side
PAKISTAN:45.1 Panyangara to Rizwan, 2 runs, Panyangara rolled his fingers across the ball this time, the off-cutter was delivered on a good length and angling in on middle, Rizwan waits on the flick and finds the gap through mid-wicket. Also brings up his 3rd ODI half-century. Superbly timed knock with Pakistan in a sticky spotTinashe Panyangara [6.0-1-23-1] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:44.6 John Nyumbu to Rizwan, 1 run, loopy full toss outside off, Rizwan can only hammer it straight to sweeper cover
PAKISTAN:44.5 John Nyumbu to Imad Wasim, 1 run, flatter and quicker on the stumps, pulled away through mid-wicket
PAKISTAN:44.4 John Nyumbu to Imad Wasim, no run, well flighted delivery drifting in on off, Wasim's eyes lit up as he wanted to launch it down the ground. The drift fools him and he can only eke out an inside edge onto pad
PAKISTAN:44.3 John Nyumbu to Imad Wasim, 2 runs, shortish outside off, the ball slightly held up in the pitch due to which Wasim was early in his cut. Checks his shot and places it wide of the cover fielder in the ring
PAKISTAN:44.2 John Nyumbu to Imad Wasim, no run, flatter and cramping Wasim for room as he was looking to cut, ends up chopping it to cover
PAKISTAN:44.1 John Nyumbu to Imad Wasim, 2 runs, a tad short outside off, Wasim rocks back and cuts hard through the covers. Not enough timing on it to beat the man sweeping the off-sideJohn Nyumbu [8.0-0-33-1] is back into the attack
PAKISTAN:43.6 Sean Williams to Rizwan, no run, looked like an action replay of the previous ball. Full toss drifting down leg, only that this time, Rizwan fails to even clear the infield with the sweep
PAKISTAN:43.5 Sean Williams to Rizwan, 2 runs, full toss and drifting down leg, Rizwan must be feeling he missed out. Sweeps well but fails to beat the deep backward square leg fielder

PAKISTAN:43.3 Sean Williams to Imad Wasim, no run, skips down the track, takes it on the full and creams the cover drive. Just the small thing of finding the gap, which he gets wrong and places it straight to cover
PAKISTAN:43.2 Sean Williams to Imad Wasim, no run, good bowling from the left-armer. Not giving any pace to work with. Very slow delivery spinning into off, Wasim was trying to paddle it down but didn't have any pace to work with
PAKISTAN:43.1 Sean Williams to Rizwan, 1 run, slowish delivery on a length around off stump, Rizwan gets his front leg out of the way and pushes it wide of cover
PAKISTAN:42.6 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, FOUR, some really useful improvisation this. Moves across to off stump, premeditates the sweep and gets the perfect ball to play the shot. Slightly fuller and angling across off, connects nicely with it and sends the ball behind square. A desperate dive in the deep also cannot prevent the boundary
PAKISTAN:42.5 Luke Jongwe to Rizwan, 1 run, angling into the pads on a fuller length, Rizwan uses his wrists nicely to whip it down to long-on
PAKISTAN:42.4 Luke Jongwe to Imad Wasim, 1 run, fraction fuller than a good length around off stump, Wasim hammers it hard down to long-on

PAKISTAN:41.3 Sean Williams to Rizwan, 1 run, well tossed up outside off, driven to sweeper cover
PAKISTAN:41.2 Sean Williams to Rizwan, no run, loopy delivery just outside off, Rizwan is drawn forward and pushes it to cover
PAKISTAN:41.1 Sean Williams to Imad Wasim, 1 run, the impact might have just been outside off with the LBW appeal. Spun back sharply beating the flick and hit him on the front pad. Might have got a feather as well
PAKISTAN:40.6 Luke Jongwe to Rizwan, 2 runs, misses the blockhole and ends up as a full toss on off stump, probably caught Rizwan by surprise as he just flicks it wide of long-on, scurries back for a second

PAKISTAN:40.1 Luke Jongwe to Rizwan, 1 run, an off-pace back of a length delivery just outside off stump, Rizwan waits on the back foot and dabs it down to third manLuke Jongwe [5.0-1-15-1] is back into the attackRight, so some nice rearguard action from this pair has put Pakistan in a position where they can look for quick runs towards the death overs.
PAKISTAN:39.6 Sean Williams to Imad Wasim, quicker from Sean Williams, Wasim punches it in front of square on the off-side
