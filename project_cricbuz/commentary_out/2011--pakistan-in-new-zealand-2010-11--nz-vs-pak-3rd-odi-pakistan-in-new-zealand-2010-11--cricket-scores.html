Batting will be easy later on.New Zealand have won the toss and elected to fieldHello and welcome to the live coverage of the 2nd ODI between NZ and Pak. The sun is out, there are scattered clouds and no threatening chances of rain ruining play today. Stay tuned we'll be back with the toss and the team line ups.The Preview by Siddharth VishwanathanWith the World Cup drawing closer, every match in this series assumes importance. New Zealand were a relieved side after they snapped their losing streak in ODIs. Pakistan looked flat and were unable to sustain momentum following a good show in the Test matches. A washed out match at Queenstown did not help either team in their preparation. The action now shifts to Christchurch, but the weather is not looking too great for that match either. Pakistan continue to be plagued by off-field problems. With the captain of the World Cup squad not being named, the turmoil and confusion within Pakistan cricket continues to intensify. With the deadline of the tainted trio in the spot-fixing controversy coming closer, the distractions are all set to continue. Ahmed Shehzad has been a good find for Pakistan up the order. His aggressive batting in the T20s and in the second ODI is a welcome sight for a Pakistan team that has struggled to find stability up the order. The middle order is a big worry with none of the batsmen looking in good touch. Younis Khan has not carried his form into the ODI format after a good show in the Tests. Asad Shafiq, Umar Akmal and Shahid Afridi were found wanting against swing. Only Misbah-ul-Haq looked solid with an attractive fifty. The batting on this tour has relied largely on Misbah and Pakistan will be counting on his good form in this series as well as for the World Cup. Pakistan's bowling has not had much opportunity to display their skills. Shoaib Akhtar was carted around to all parts of the ground in the first ODI. Sohail Tanvir looked rusty on his comeback while Abdul Razzaq was ineffective. In the continued absence of Saeed Ajmal, the spin duties have been shared by Afridi and Abdur Rehman. Pakistan will be hoping that all the bowlers strike form before the World Cup. Shoaib Akhtar will be desperate for a turnaround after a miserable T20 and first ODI.New Zealand will be happy to finally get a taste of victory after a torturous 2010. Tim Southee was the star at Wellington by picking up his maiden five wicket haul. Southee has troubled Pakistan with his immaculate swing bowling and he has been backed up well by Bennett, Oram and Vettori. With the arrival of Allan Donald as the bowling consultant for the Kiwis, NZ will be hoping to tunr-around their bowling, which has looked weak. The batting poses fewer worries with Ryder, Guptill and Taylor looking in awesome touch. The middle order has not yet been tested in this series, but NZ have solidity all around. Styris, Franklin and Brendon McCullum have a great reputation at the death and NZ will bank on these three to boost the Kiwis at the death. This series will have a clear winner thanks to the rain-curtailed match at Queenstown. With the World Cup coming so close, both teams would want to ensure that they win the series and carry a lot of confidence into the mega-event.Teams:New Zealand (From): Hamish Bennett, Ross Taylor(c), Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(w), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Scott Styris, Jamie How, Jacob Oram, Kyle Mills, Luke Woodcock, Kane WilliamsonPakistan (From): Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rehman, Ahmed Shehzad, Asad Shafiq, Mohammad Hafeez, Saeed Ajmal, Shoaib Akhtar, Tanvir Ahmed, Umar Akmal, Umar Gul, Wahab Riaz, Younis Khan, Sohail Tanvir, Misbah-ul-Haq, Kamran Akmal(w)LATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
