Hasim Amla is back after missing out on the last match with a knee injury. Rory Kleinveldt replaces Ryan McLaren, who is out with an injury. Sri Lanka have welcomed back Lahiru Thirimanne, he replaces Angelo Perera.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, AB de Villiers(c), Faf du Plessis, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Robin Peterson, Morne Morkel, Rory Kleinveldt, Lonwabo TsotsobeSri Lanka (Playing XI): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews(c), Thisara Perera, Rangana Herath, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith MalingaSouth Africa have won the toss and elected to batHello and welcome to the coverage of the 4th ODI between Sri Lanka and South Africa. Sri Lanka won the first 2 ODIs but the visitors pulled things back in the third game, and are still alive in the series. They may be boosted by the return of Hashim Amla, who was seen training after missing the third ODI. Stay tuned for the other updates.South Africa managed to stay alive in the series with their first ODI win in Sri Lanka since 1993. Today, as the two teams clash again in what could be a tight contest, Sri Lanka have the chance to take an unbeatable 3-1 lead but for that to happen, the hosts would have to brush up their middle-order batting.Sri Lanka: So South Africa finally showed some fight for the first time in the series in the third ODI at Pallekele and the hosts were immediately pegged back. In seaming conditions, both teams managed to snare early wickets but while South Africa rode on a 72-ball 85 from David Miller, the Lankans had no such flourish from their batsmen. Clearly then, Sri Lanka's middle-order has a lot to work on when the two sides clash in the fourth game today. Kumar Sangakkara has been in brilliant form but once he along with Tharanga and Jayawardene failed on Friday, the rest of the middle-order caved in against some high quality Proteas bowling.Sri Lanka rely on good scores from their top four and Dilshan's poor form since his return has not helped. He is an explosive batsman and can take the game away very quickly if he gets going, so he will need to fire sooner rather than later. This will be a good chance for the hosts to seal the series but another slip-up here would strengthen South Africa's momentum in the series.Strengths: Sri Lanka were tight and compact in all departments of the game till their batsmen were found out on a dry surface at Pallekele. The conditions would be similar today and therein lies Sri Lanka's challenge. Sangakkara is the driving force in the batting line-up while Rangana Herathn and Lasith Malinga would be expected to cause serious damage with the ball. The opening combination of Tharanga and Dilshan looks threatening on paper but the duo will need to put some runs on the board to intimidate the Africans.Weaknesses: The middle-order. If the top three or four fail, the likes of Chandimal, Mathews and Perera, lower down the order will have to take up some more responsibility. With Dilshan's return, Jayawardene has been pushed down to bolster the batting line-up but on Friday, nothing seemed to work for the Islanders.South Africa: AB deVilliers insisted his side played better with their backs to the wall and true to the skipper's words, South Africa came up with a breathtaking show. Miller impressed with his pyrotechnics to help establish a challenging score before Lonwabo Tsotsobe pocketed four wickets and with Morne Morkel blew away the Sri Lankans as South Africa kept alive their chances in the series.The Proteas have been poor travelers to Sri Lanka but their skills in helpful conditions at Pallekele would be a warning signal to the hosts. The visitors need their batsmen to show more fight and even on Friday, besides deVilliers and Miller, there was not much else from the others. Strengths: South Africa's bowling looked sharp and resourceful even without Dale Steyn and that will continue to shivers through the Sri Lankan line-up. Tsotsobe was spectacular with the new ball and his spell ensured the hosts never got off to any kind of start while Morkel was impressive once again. They also bat pretty deep, with someone of Miller's abilities at seven and that should be enough firepower should the top-order not get too many.Weaknesses: The opening combination has been a headache for deVilliers with Amla's injury. Quinton deKock, who got a game on Friday disappointed with Alviro Petersen. He had spoken of not losing early wickets but it was the same story two days back. The captain himself needs to play a big knock and lead from the front as their best batsman.
