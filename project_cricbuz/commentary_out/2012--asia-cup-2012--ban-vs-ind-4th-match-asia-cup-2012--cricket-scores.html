Tamim Iqbal is on strike. Praveen Kumar will open the attackWelcome back to the chase..Sachin's hundredth 100 will be the talk of the nation over the next few days. Right now, India have some work to do. They need to defend 289.What was supposed to be just another league game in the Asia cup has been illuminated by a huge achievement. Sachin Tendulkar, after having played for nearly 23 years, continues to impress. THE hundred that dominated a lot of talk in the previous year has finally come and Tendulkar was very calm despite the euphoria around him after getting to the hundred. His hundred helped India get to a competitive score on a sluggish track. Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina made vital contributions too. Bangladesh have a stiff task ahead and one suspects that the Indian spinners will have a huge role to play later in the game. Join us shortly for the chase.Sachin Tendulkar: I can't think of too much right now. It has been a tough phase for me. I felt I was batting well in Australia but I was luckless. I was not thinking about the milestone. There was no talk about it when I scored the 99th but the media eventually made it a big thing. Everywhere I went (restaurants, hotels, room service, the ground) the talk was only about the 100th hundred. I decided to do what was best for the team, you know, put your head down and grind it out. I'm glad to have got it now. The ball was not coming on. I talked with Virat and we decided that 270-280 would be a good score. Virat who batted long in the previous game, said that this track is a little slower. The achievement has definitely not sunk in but I've lost about 50 kilos (laughs). Dreams do come true. I waited for 22 years to win the World Cup and so my advise to youngsters would be to chase their dreams.4

Gambhir is on strike. Mortaza will open the attackTeams:India (Playing XI): Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Irfan Pathan, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Ashok DindaBangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Nazimuddin, Jahurul Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Shakib Al Hasan, Nasir Hossain, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Shafiul Islam, Shahadat HossainDhoni: I think in the second half the pitch over here gets a little better. We aren't really unhappy to bat first since it spins a little more in the latter part of the day. Dinda has come in for this game for Vinay Kumar who is unwell. We have been beaten by Bangladesh a few times since 2004. We never take any side lightly no matter who they are. I think we have been doing well but there are a few areas where we need to improve especially when it comes to the bowling and fielding.Mushfiqur: We would like to bowl first because we think there might be some spin and we want to capitalize on that. I think if we bowl well and field well then we can do well against a team like India. I think there is more to come from us today. We are unchanged.Bangladesh have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch report: It is a new pitch. The difference in this one is that there has been a few foot marks on the pitch owing to the fielders running around on it during the previous game. The spinners might get a little bit of turn on this track and Sunil Gavaskar feels that is where Bangladesh can get an edge. According to him the team that wins the toss will want to bat first and put on something in excess of 250.India take on Bangladesh in the 4th match of the Asia Cup at Dhaka. India come into the match a confident unit after winning their opening game against Sri Lanka. Bangladesh too will be fairly confident - although they lost to Pakistan, they competed hard and nearly pulled off an upset. A victory for India will more or less seal their spot in the finals and virtually knock Bangladesh out of the tournament.Karthik (supporting India) and Shashreek (supporting Bangladesh) reason out why they believe their team will win. Shashreek: India's overseas form has been appalling in recent times. Although the game is in the sub-continent, it is still a tournament on foreign soil for India. Do you think 'the men in blue' can recover from their slump in form and take on a side that has sprung a surprise or two in the past? I certainly don't!Karthik: You certainly don't? I guess you conveniently ignored India's last 2 games - both against Sri Lanka. Everyone knows India are easily the best side in the world when it comes to playing in the sub-continent, and they showed exactly that in their Asia Cup opening match. Even the game in Hobart was played on a pitch that resembled a sub-continent track and everyone saw what happened there. Bangladesh can still spring up a surprise or two, but the answer to your question lies in your question itself - a Bangladesh victory will always be a 'surprise'.Shashreek: When one thinks of Bangladesh vs India all that comes to mind is the 2007 World Cup when the Bangla Tigers led to the Indians being ousted from the tournament. One man who stood out in that clash was Tamim Iqbal and he is Bangladesh's man in form again. I'm sure that sends a few shivers down your spine, does it not?Karthik: Well, the only thing that comes to my mind when I think of Bangladesh vs India is the 2011 World Cup when Sehwag absolutely demolished the Banglas. Yes, Tamim Iqbal may be in form now, Sehwag may not be there in the Indian side, but neither of that will be a cause of concern for the Indians. Shashreek: India seem to have a lot of non performers hanging around in the playing eleven. The likes of Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja haven't done anything of substance in the opportunities given to them. Do you think it is time for a few changes, or are you scared that the replacements might be weaker than the non performers?Karthik: Ravindra Jadeja is always the guy to bear the brunt of the fans' anger, and not all of it is justified. He may have had a poor tour of Australia, but one should not forget that the Asia Cup is being played in Bangladesh. Have a look at Jadeja's performances against England and West Indies last year, and you will know why Dhoni persists with him in the team. Having said that, the Bangladesh game might be the best opportunity for India to test their bench. The likes of Tiwary and Yusuf Pathan certainly deserve a game and they could be drafted in to the team. But, knowing Dhoni, I won't be surprised if the Indian team remains unchanged!Karthik: Bangladesh are playing ODI cricket for more than a decade. They are playing at home. But still, they are considered minnows and are not even considered as a potential team. Your thoughts if any at all?Shashreek: In the decade that has gone by Bangladesh has defeated teams like South Africa and India at the highest level, that being the World Cup. Bangladesh has also churned out talents like Mashrafe Mortaza, Tamim Iqbal and possibly the best all rounder in the One Day format as of now- Shakib Al Hasan. Calling them minnows and looking at them as pushovers will only prove to be a disastrous mistake, much like it did in 2007 for India.Karthik: Isn't the attack one dimensional? A couple of medium pacers and a couple of left arm spinners. This surely will not worry the Indian batting line up?Shashreek: If the Indian bowling line up, comprising of a couple of medium pacers who bowl within the 130 mark and a couple of part timers can trouble an opposition, then Bangladesh's surely can do the same if not better. Besides with the likes of Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja already looking so worried in the middle order, Bangladesh will not have to do too much to rattle their feathers. Sachin Tendulkar will be eager to get that 100th 100 off his mind and there comes the opportunity for Bangladesh to really pile on the pressure right from the top.Karthik: The batting hasn't shown any signs of improvement. Some batsmen get starts, but they are still too heavily dependent on Shakib Al Hasan and the others fail to finish games under pressure. Shashreek: Sure Bangladesh didn't finish off the last game but their batting certainly looks to have some positives. Tamim Iqbal played very well under pressure to score a half century and Shakib Al Hasan too looked in good touch. Bangladesh have more than just Shakib though and India will have to plan for more than just him otherwise they might find themselves on the receiving end! Karthik: Well, you seem to have a lot of confidence in this Bangladesh team. Let's see if they can upset India.Shashreek: It will no longer be an upset!Teams:Bangladesh (From): Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Anamul Haque, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah, Nazmul Hossain, Shahadat Hossain, Tamim Iqbal, Abdur Razzak, Elias Sunny, Jahurul Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza, Nazimuddin, Shafiul Islam, Shakib Al Hasan, Nasir HossainIndia (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Virat Kohli, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ashok Dinda, Gautam Gambhir, Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar, Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan, Suresh Raina, Sachin Tendulkar, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay Kumar, Rohit Sharma, Rahul SharmaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
