Shafiul Islam will open the attackShakib's decision to bat first on what looked like a flat pitch looked good when Tamim and Kayes got Bangladesh off to a whirlwind start. They had notched up the fifty in the 5th over itself. However, everything went downhill from that point as the medium-pacers stifled the scoring rate. The duo of Andre Botha and George Dockrell wrecked the Bangladesh middle order. They were backed up by some excellent fielding as well. Dockrell, in particular, was the star as he made the Bangladesh batsmen look at sea against his loopy spinners. In the end, Bangladesh have folded up for 205 thanks to a good cameo from Naeem Islam. Ireland will be happy with their effort but it will be a tricky target. The wicket is keeping low and assisting the spinners. Bangladesh will be hoping that their spinners, Razzak, Shakib and Naeem Islam help Bangladesh put up a fight. Join us in a short while for the Ireland run-chase.4

Just the one change in the team, Ashraful comes in for Mahmudullah.Bangladesh have won the toss and elected to batPitch report: The ground here is pretty big. It's a complete batting wicket with no grass, it is flat and hard. Botham reckons the pitch will remain the same throughout the game. Both the teams are better chasers and will look to bowl first and chase down the total.Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the 9th Match of this World Cup between Bangaldesh and Ireland. It's an important match for both the teams as this is the 1st game for Ireland and Bangladesh are coming out from the defeat against India in the opening match. Remember last time Ireland beat Bangladesh in the 2007 World Cup and Bangladesh will looking to avenge the defeat. Stay tuned for the toss and the team info....By Gokul GopalWith the opening game of the 2011 World Cup not going their way, co-hosts Bangladesh would be hoping to put aside their defeat against India and start the tournament afresh as they get set to take on Ireland. The pressure of expectation from the Bangladesh fans got to the home team as they were hammered by 87 runs by tournament favourites India in their first match. The Tigers would now be hoping for a convincing win against Ireland to get their World Cup campaign moving forward.Head to Head: Ireland have tasted success over Bangladesh in a couple of World events. They had defeated the Tigers by 74 runs in the Super 8s stage of the 2007 World Cup and had also beaten them by 6 wickets in the World Twenty20 in England in 2009. However, going by the overall figures, Bangladesh have a better record against the Irish. They have won 4 games and lost 2 to Ireland.Build up to the game:Bangladesh: After all the hype surrounding the opening match of the 2011 World Cup, Bangladesh's ability to upset the bigger sides and also their win against India in the 2007 World Cup, the Bangladesh fans had all expectations on the home team to beat India once again. But the co-hosts buckled down under pressure and a Sehwag onslaught. The new ball bowlers were inconsistent with their line and length and gave away far too many loose deliveries as admitted by the skipper Shakib Al Hasan. Sehwag and Kohli made merry as they hit superb centuries to pile on a mammoth total of 370. The bowlers took a beating at the hands of the rampaging India, with Shafiul Islam going for 69 runs in his seven overs and his new-ball partner Rubel Hossain conceding 60 runs in 10 wicketless overs, which in the end resulted in a 87-run defeat for Bangladesh. However, there were some positives for the home side from the match. It was a spirited chase as Tamim Iqbal hit a fighting 70, well-supported by Shakib's fluent 55 off 50 balls.
Bangladesh must now beat both Ireland and Netherlands, and one of the established sides from England, South Africa and West Indies, to progress to the next round. However, they should not think that far ahead. The best thing for the Tigers would be to take it one match at a time and give their best performance. The spinners would be the key on a slow track and the likes of Razzaq and Shakib will have important roles to play during the match. They would also be hoping for the quickies to perform better in this match and deliver some early break-throughs. It is imperative that Bangladesh come up with a complete all-round effort as they would be up against Ireland, a team known to cause quite a few upsets.Ireland: The Irish team's rise in cricket has been a steady one. Ever since their famous win against Pakistan in the 2007 World Cup, Ireland have been improving constantly and have been taking commendable strides in the International arena. Since 2006, Ireland have played 58 ODIs and have won 28, albeit against some weaker oppositions. From 2010, the European team has won 11 of the 17 ODIs played, including wins against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.
Ireland's performance in the warm-up games also showed how determined the team is. They came up with a brave fight against New Zealand while chasing an imposing total of 311. Porterfield, Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien and Trent Johnston all impressed with the bat as Ireland finished with a total of 279. In their second warm-up match, Ireland successfully chased down a target of 245 thanks to the efforts of Cusack, Botha and Kevin O'Brien. Considering the form of the Irish batters, Bangladesh will have to come up with a good show to hold off Ireland.Pitch and Ground conditions:
The opening game of the mega event saw India post a mammoth total of 370 at the Shere Bangla National Stadium, Dhaka. However, the captains said after the match that the track was pretty slow and the batsmen did not have an easy time. A similar kind of track can be expected for this game and the team winning the toss is likely to bowl first. Clear skies are forecast for the day-night encounter but the dew factor might come into play later in the evening, although not much of dew was seen in the opening game.Quotes:I don't think Ireland like to play in these conditions. This is not to say we will take them lightly. Ireland have been playing good cricket. But in our conditions, which suit slow bowlers, we are a good bowling side: Shakib Al Hasan, hinting that Bangladesh would target Ireland with spin.
I think Holland have made a statement which has come as no surprise to Holland and likewise on Friday we will make a statement which will come as no surprise to us: Andrew White, mentioning that Ireland had been inspired by the valiant performance of Netherlands against England.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaid Siddique, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Shakib Al Hasan(c), Raqibul Hasan, Mohammad Ashraful, Mahmudullah, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain, Shahriar Nafees, Nazmul Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Suhrawadi ShuvoIreland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Andre Botha, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien(w), Kevin O'Brien, Andrew White, John Mooney, Trent Johnston, Boyd Rankin, George Dockrell, Alex Cusack, Nigel Jones, Albert van der Merwe, Gary WilsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
