SL lose a reviewReview time: Sanga and Co. are desperate to get Taylor out and they take a review. It was given not-out by Erasmus and the original decision stands.

ZIMBABWE:8.6  Perera to Chakabva, FOUR!!, As Ali Campbell on air says, Malinga never looked like stopping it, that shot deserved four anyway, hard cut shot, Malinga at third man went back to stop it and the ball scooted through his hands, he then looks at the turf as if to suggest that there was something in it which made the ball to speed away, Dilshan and Perera are not impressed
ZIMBABWE:8.5  Perera to Chakabva, no run, fullish and on off, Chakabva comes on the frontfoot and drives with no timing to mid off

ZIMBABWE:6.5  Perera to Chakabva, no run, good ball and Chakabva is playing a bit too much inside the line of the ball, this one rises up from a back of a length area on off stump, it flies past the edge of Chakabva who clearly is not picking up the ones that are straightening off the seam

ZIMBABWE:4.5  Malinga to Taylor, FOUR!!, The shot of the day so far, he practices those shots and he pulls off another beauty. He played one like that against New Zealand, this one is not quite that good, yet very effective, the perfect ad for the Upar Cut, short pacy bouncer outside off, Taylor arched his back and as Sanga was waiting to take it in his gloves, he guided it up and over him, both Malinga and Sanga admire the shot, wonderfully done, even Sachin would have been proud of that and I'm not exaggerating here
ZIMBABWE:4.4  Malinga to Taylor, no run, Oh! That has hit the splice of Taylor's bat and broken the handle. Immediately Taylor signals to the dressing room to get a new corker and they come out with a new one, it was a pacy back of a length delivery on middle, Taylor got forward and it thudded hard into the splice and that made the handle go
ZIMBABWE:4.3  Malinga to Taylor, FOUR!!, Timing, beautiful timing, that is the essence of Taylor's batting and he just leant forward to push that on the up, it was a short of length delivery outside off and Taylor merely pushed it wide of cover and the quick outfield does the rest
ZIMBABWE:4.2  Malinga to Chakabva, 1 run, nudged wide of short mid wicket and brings Taylor on strike
ZIMBABWE:4.1  Malinga to Taylor, 1 run, chipped to the right of a lunging Malinga, to the naked eye it looked like Malinga got a hand on that, but it never did, hit the stumps at the non-striker's end and dribbled wide of short mid
ZIMBABWE:4.1  Malinga to Taylor, wide, wayward delivery, very wayward, way outside off, wide calledBanners in the crowd: Lots of placards in the crowd suggesting that the Lankans have got a lot of faith in their side.

ZIMBABWE:3.1  Kulasekara to Chakabva, no run, a stifled appeal from Sanga, a very good delivery that, a sharp in-ducker and Chakabva was ages late on the cut, it nipped back in sharply and hit the front pad before going to Sanga, the impact was outside off and no bat on that too, SL don't risk a review and rightly soRussel Arnold on air: Malinga only had two balls in his earlier days - the yorker and the bouncer and was very wayward. Now he is a much mature bowler and varies his lengths accordingly.
ZIMBABWE:2.6  Malinga to Chakabva, 1 run, Chakabva is anticipating the yorker, instead it is the slower one in the block-hole, Chakabva squeezes it wide of short mid and retains strike
ZIMBABWE:2.5  Malinga to Chakabva, no run, gets the direction right, short, sharp delivery outside off, Chakabva sways out of the line and lets it go

ZIMBABWE:1.6  Kulasekara to Taylor, 2 runs, Dilshan causally lobs up the throw back to Sanga who is already walking back to the other end as it is the end of the over, he misses and the openers are quick enough to spot that and take an extra run
ZIMBABWE:1.5  Kulasekara to Taylor, 2 runs, takes it from off stump and rolls his wrists over to tuck it wide of short mid wicket, well played
ZIMBABWE:1.4  Kulasekara to Taylor, no run, are Sri Lanka going in for the review? No they are not! Taylor shuffles across a bit too much, the ball landed on off and with the angle would've gone down leg reckons Sanga, who has a smile on his face as the camera pans to him, Kulasekara wanted the review to be taken, but his skipper did not, it would've missed the leg stump as it was delivered from wide of the crease
ZIMBABWE:1.3  Kulasekara to Chakabva, 1 run, guided with an open face past backward point for a single, down to third man
ZIMBABWE:1.2  Kulasekara to Chakabva, no run, solid forward defence to a good length delivery that nipped back in off the seam after swiging in the air

ZIMBABWE:0.6  Malinga to Taylor, no run, fullish, outside off, driven crisply, but finds cover, straight to the fielder
ZIMBABWE:0.5  Malinga to Taylor, FOUR!!, if Malinga misses the yorker, then it will be a gift, this one certainly is, a low full toss on leg stump and all Taylor had to do was get some bat on it and he did, clipping it away past square leg and the white ball screamed away to the fence, Taylor if he gets off to a good start can anchor this innings and that was a good way to get off the mark
ZIMBABWE:0.4  Malinga to Chakabva, 1 run, defended to short mid wicket and an easy single for Chakabva to get off the mark
ZIMBABWE:0.3  Malinga to Chakabva, no run, Ooh! Chakabva closed the face too early and is lucky that he did not miss it, if he had, he was a dead duck, the leading edge dribbles along the ground
ZIMBABWE:0.3  Malinga to Chakabva, wide, slips one down leg, Chakabva got inside the line to tuck it, it went past his leg stump and a wide called
ZIMBABWE:0.2  Malinga to Taylor, byes, 1 run, tentative start from Taylor and Sanga, Taylor poked at one that whistled past his edge and Sanga did not bend down to collect that, allows a bye and the Zimbabweans are away
ZIMBABWE:0.1  Malinga to Taylor, no run, close to a wide, but just about lands inside the line, Malinga pushed it full and wide outside offTaylor and Chakabva are at the crease. Taylor is on strike. Malinga will open the attackWelcome back for the Zimbabwean chase. It is going to be one herculean task for them to chase it down. The ball will definitely swing under lights and it will be quite a challenge to face up to the combination of Kula and Malinga. Malinga before this game has played only one match and has taken a 6 wicket haul - which included a hat-trick. If he gets it right again, we might see a swift end to this game. Will that happen? We will know soon as he has the new nut. Two slips wait in anticipation. It will be Srivathsa, to start off proceedings.Tharanga: Dilshan played really well, he played magnificently well and got the momentum. I played with him and played my normal game. The plan was to get a good start and after that try to play through-out the innings. Dilshan wanted to take the batting PP after the 34th over, but then after that we decided to take it after I got to my ton. I always try to play my favorite shots - the inside out hit over cover and the cut shots. This is a good score and we are confident that we can defend the score.The Sri Lankan openers went on a rampage against the hapless Zim attack as they posted a massive score. Nothing went right for Zim except the toss and the decision to bowl first was not a bad one considering the dew factor. However, the openers put the attack to the sword quite early to grab the initiative. The only time Dilshan seemed to be in any trouble was after he reached his ton and suffered a bout of cramps. Tharanga grew in confidence gradually and opened up towards the end. Both perished while trying to up the ante in the slog overs but had done enough damage by then. Despite losing the plot in the end overs, SL have enough runs on the board and Zim will need something really special from someone to overhaul which seems highly unlikely. With Malinga leading the attack SL will look to finish things off quickly. Join us shortly for the run chase.4
SRI LANKA:49.6  Mpofu to Samaraweera, leg byes, 1 run, moves across to off and misses the flick, a muted appeal from Mpofu, but it was striking Samaraweera well outside off, end of the Lankan innings and Samaraweera and Sangakkara walk off with a smile on their faces

Sri Lanka will be looking to seal their place in the quarter-finals with a win today against a Zimbabwe side that will be looking to cause a major upset. The Sri Lankans will be banking on the two Ms- Malinga and Murali to wreck a fragile Zimbabwe batting order. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.....Preview by Vishaal LoganathanSri Lanka have been victorious only against the minnows so far in the World Cup and it looks like the trend is set to continue when they take on Zimbabwe at Kandy. Zimbabwe have come out on top only against Canada but have been far from impressive against the more established teams.
Sri Lanka
Considered to be amongst the favourites to lift the trophy, the Islanders had to undergo a minor blip in the tale when they lost to Pakistan. Their stance as frontrunners to lift the World Cup was immediately under question and it took a clinical performance against Kenya to silence some of their critics.
Sri Lanka have always been fantastic at home and the Zimbabweans will have to come up with an extraordinary effort if they are to soil that reputation, at least somewhat. Their batting has a good mix of batsmen who are able to counter or consolidate. T. Dilshan will play the way only he can knowing that the likes of Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera will consolidate if need be for the team.
How Sri Lanka regularly come up with bowlers who befuddle the batsmen with variety and unique style has always amazed me. M. Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis and Lasith Malinga need no introduction and they will continue to bemuse the batsmen with their bowling. The trio can be very tough to come to terms with, and Zimbabwe would do well to keep them quite and attack the other bowlers.
Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe need no telling that the odds are against them when they face Sri Lanka, but they could use it to their advantage as they know they have nothing to lose. They have one win under their belt after cantering to a win against Canada, but this will surely be a much sterner test.
Tatenda Taibu remains Zimbabwe's best bet with the bat and their fans will be praying for the diminutive wicket keeper to click with the bat. They do have other batsmen who can fire, but the likes of Brendon Taylor and Craig Ervine have been very inconsistent and up against a quality bowling line up the job is only likely to get harder.
Their bowling department is heavily reliant on Ray Price to deliver the goods, and on occasions that the left hander has failed to do so, Zimbabwe have struggled. He is Zimbabwe's main wicket taking bowler and usually operates at the start, but against Sri Lanka - who are filled to the brim with quality players of spin - Zimbabwe might have to look for someone else to come good with the ball.
Head to Head:
Sri Lanka have won 38 matches out of the 46 times they've played Zimbabwe.
Quotes:
Mahela Jayawardene: I think we can still improve on our batting, try to bat for longer periods and make sure we build partnerships. Even on the field there is always room to improve. We are a very hard-working side when it comes to fielding. We just have to keep improving and make sure we make the most of half-chances.
Elton Chigumbura: They (Ireland) always believed in themselves. We obviously believe in ourselves but there might be room to improve. My team has been on that path. If you believe you can beat a bigger team, you can do that. It's up to every individual to have that same belief and that gives me motivation.
