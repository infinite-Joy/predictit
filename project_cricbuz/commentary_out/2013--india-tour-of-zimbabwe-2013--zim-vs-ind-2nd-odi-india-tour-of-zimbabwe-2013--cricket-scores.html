Vinay Kumar will open the attackWelcome back. The players are already out there on the field.Dhawan was well supported by Dinesh Karthik who helped himself to a 50. At the end, Vinay Kumar played a nice little cameo as 23 came off the final over. Zimbabwe who are considered to be one of the best fielding sides in the world had a horrible day, dropping 3 catches and even the ground-fielding wasn't up to their usually high standards. Maybe it was an off-day for them. That's the only plausible excuse one can think of. Anway Zimbabwe will need a collective effort with the bat if they are to have any hopes of chasing this down. We will be back with the chase shortly.Zimbabwe have only themselves to blame, no-one else for their first-half showing. They had the ideal conditions to bowl in - it was swinging and seaming, they even got the early wicket of Rohit Sharma, but it all changed when Jarvis got a wicket off a no-ball. From then, things went pear-shaped as India gained momentum from that point. Still the story didn't end there. Rayudu was dropped and then Dhawan, who made the Zimbabwean bowlers pay for their poor stuff with his 3rd 100.4

INDIA:45.6  Sean Williams to Ravindra Jadeja, no run, defended
INDIA:45.5  Sean Williams to Amit Mishra, out Amit Mishra Run Out!! 2 runs completed. Hilarious stuff that. Ravindra Jadeja wanted the third after the ball went down to third man, Amit Mishra wasn't interested at all, but the throw came to the bowler's end, so Mishra had to sacrifice himself. The throw wasn't great, so Mishra had still time to make an attempt at getting back, but he decides to look back at Jadeja and that gives the bowler time to whip the bails off. Even as Mishra was walking back, he decided to look back at Jadeja for some strange reason. Funny run-out - this will go into the highlights reel for sure. Amit Mishra run out (Sibanda/Sean Williams) 9(7) [4s-1] Sean Williams to Amit Mishra, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Comical run-out that. Mishra is gone. He didn't even try to go for the third run, instead looking back at Ravindra Jadeja all the way. By then all the damage was done.

INDIA:44.6  Chatara to Amit Mishra, FOUR, Amit Mishra can certainly wield the willow. He shuffles across to off, lifts this slower delivery wide of short fine leg. Well played

INDIA:44.5  Chatara to Ravindra Jadeja, 1 run, slower delivery outside off, Ravindra Jadeja squeezes it square of the wicket

INDIA:43.3  Utseya to Dhawan, out Bowled!! What a freak way to get out. Flat and fired down the leg-side, Dhawan was early into the paddle shot, it went off the glove and rattled into the stumps, behind the legs of Dhawan. Brendan Taylor pats Dhawan on the back as the Delhi man walks off with a smile on his face. End of Dhawan. Dhawan b Utseya 116(127) [4s-11 6s-2] Utseya to Dhawan, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

INDIA:42.2  Chatara to Dhawan, out Dinesh Karthik Run Out!! Honestly that was the only way that Zimbabwe looked like taking a wicket. A horrible mix-up between Dhawan and Dinesh Karthik results in the latter sacrificing himself. Dhawan got a bottom edge near Taylor, both stuttered and stumbled, were close to each other near the half-way area on the pitch when Taylor picked the ball and under-armed the stumps to hit direct. Oxenford was in a great position and sends Dinesh Karthik back after seeing him crossing Dhawan. Dinesh Karthik run out (Brendan Taylor) 69(74) [4s-6] Chatara to Dhawan, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!
INDIA:42.1  Chatara to Dinesh Karthik, 3 runs, Dinesh Karthik was deceived initially by the full toss but managed to get it over short fine's head. They take 3 runs by the time the fielder slides and pulls it back

INDIA:41.5  B Vitori to Dinesh Karthik, 1 run, back of a length on off, Dinesh Karthik calmly plays that behind point and turns the strike over
INDIA:41.4  B Vitori to Dhawan, 1 run, comes down the track and punches this to point
INDIA:41.3  B Vitori to Dhawan, SIX, now Dhawan is moving into another gear. What improvisation. Shuffles across to off, picks the full ball on the stumps and whip-flicks it over the man at deep backward square, who saw the ball sailing over his head even as he was back-pedalling to try and catch it. Super stroke
INDIA:41.2  B Vitori to Dhawan, no run, so close to a wicket. Nipped in, Dhawan was trying to go over cover, got an inside edge onto the pads that just missed the leg-stump by the width of a cigarette paper. Also it just fell short of Brendan Taylor. A close shave that

INDIA:40.3  Masakadza to Dhawan, 2 runs, 100 for Shikhar Dhawan. Must say it's been a lucky one. Was caught off a no-ball and dropped twice thereafter, but as they say, you make your own luck and Dhawan has certainly made the Zimbabweans pay for all their lapses in the field. This is his 3rd ODI ton and gets there with a punch wide of long off. Knows it's two, calls DK across and makes it easily. Off goes the helmet and then comes the broad smile. Acknowledged by his India team-mates. But the big question is: where is the moustache twirl?
INDIA:40.2  Masakadza to Dhawan, no run, full outside off, driven straight to the fielder at cover
INDIA:40.1  Masakadza to Dinesh Karthik, 1 run, angled in, worked from middle stump to deep mid wicket

INDIA:39.5  Utseya to Dhawan, FOUR, rank bad bowling, short and wide outside off, begging to be hit. Dhawan is in no mood to turn down the gift, hammers that really hard through cover and gives the man running across from sweeper no chance
INDIA:39.4  Utseya to Dhawan, no run, pushed to cover, straight to the fielder
INDIA:39.3  Utseya to Dinesh Karthik, 1 run, pulled to backward square leg

INDIA:37.1  Utseya to Dhawan, 2 runs, short and wide outside off, cut away square of the wicket for a coupleBatting powerplay: India have made 39/0. Dhawan is making full use of Zimbabwe's hospitality and thriving on the lives that he has got. All set for a good total are India.
INDIA:36.6  Jarvis to Dhawan, 1 run, Jarvis comes round the wicket and bowls a yorker length delivery outside off, squeezed down to backward point
INDIA:36.5  Jarvis to Dhawan, SIX, Dhawan is hurting Jarvis and Zimbabwe with each run he is scoring. Add 6 more to his tally and it's a big one too. In fact the ball has disappeared into the stands and we need a new one after Dhawan picked the full one on off-stump and deposited it into the deep mid-wicket fence.

INDIA:35.2  Utseya to Dhawan, FOUR, has Waller dropped a straight-forward catch? Looks like it, still awaiting a replay. Yes, it's a dropped catch. Replays are in: Dhawan slog-swept that hard and it went right through Waller's hands at deep mid-wicket. That should've been taken. Yet another life for Dhawan. He continues to live merrily

Jarvis and Vitori are a good combination in conditions that assist seam bowling.Teams:India (Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli(c), Dinesh Karthik(w), Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra, Shami Ahmed, Vinay Kumar, Jaidev UnadkatZimbabwe (Playing XI): Vusi Sibanda, Sikandar Raza, Sean Williams, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w/c), Malcolm Waller, Elton Chigumbura, Brian Vitori, Prosper Utseya, Kyle Jarvis, Tendai ChataraVirat Kohli: "I would have batted first on this wicket. It is going to be a challenge. We had some testing conditions in West Indies and England and we came out with flying colors. I just had to build a partnership and I told Rayudu to be calm. Unadkat is a good bowler and I am pleased that Rayudu made his chance count."Brendan Taylor: "We will bowl first and try to get some early breakthroughs. We have to show a bit more intent. Brian Vitori replaces Tinotenda Mutombodzi."Zimbabwe have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report: There is an even covering of grass and there are not many cracks on the surface. The captain winning the toss will want to bowl first.Zimbabwe will be looking to start off on a positive note in this match after their openers started off slowly in the first match. Sikandar Raza and Elton Chigumbura were the stars with the bat but the rest of the batting has to step up and contribute. Their bowling, though, remains a concern.Welcome one and all to the 2nd ODI between Zimbabwe and India from Harare. India clinically dismantled the home team in the first ODI and they will be looking for a repeat act in the second. Indian skipper Virat Kohli led from the front and scored his 15th ODI century while Ambati Rayudu scored a fine fifty on debut.India will be eager to assert further domination in the series against Zimbabwe. This is a Catch 22 tour for the Indians - one hand they are expected to win easily while a single loss would raise harsh questions on the abilities of the team despite some really good results in the recent past. Zimbabwe on the other hand, will just be hoping to slay the giants at least once along the way.India India put up a clinical performance to hand Zimbabwe a six-wicket defeat in the first game of the series in Harare. So all seems well with the world champions, who are traveling without MS Dhoni and four of their key bowlers. Virat Kohli was at his best, cracking his 15th ODI century while Ambbati Rayudu had a dream debut, smashing an unbeaten 63 as the visitors chased down 229 in the 45th over. The bowlers had delivered some tight spells after Kohli put Zimbabwe in and Amit Mishra was lethal, taking three wickets in his comeback match. The hosts did not threaten to raise the scoring rate for a large part of the innings and that allowed the inexperienced Indian attack to settle down nicely.However, the death bowling turned out to be a concern for India again. While Vinay Kumar, Shami Ahmed and another debutant, Jaidev Unadkat kept things tight in the morning, the seamers and Mishra bowled some poor deliveries in the fag end of the Zimbabwean innings, allowing Elton Chigumbura to play a delightful cameo and set India a healthy target.Kohli did get most of his bowling changes right at the Harare Sports Club but he would want his bowlers to keep things a lot tighter in the slog overs.There are no likely changes to the Indian team for the second ODI. Rayudu should now be a permanent feature for the rest of the series while Cheteshwar Pujara, who has cemented his place in the Test squad might have to wait for at least two more games before he gets a chance. The only way he can push is way in the team is if Dinesh Karthik continues to flop. The Tamil Nadu wicketkeeper-batsman, after his two centuries in the warm-up games in the Champions Trophy, has not done much and patience could be wearing thin if he does not do anything substantial in the next two games.Strengths and weaknesses The Indian batting line-up is at full strength, even without MS Dhoni. Rayudu looked composed and calm in his stay at the crease while Kohli has worked himself back to great form. The openers, Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma have are capable of firing the team to good starts and the Zimbabwean camp would be a worried lot as long as the opening pair stays in the middle. The death bowling needs to improve if India are to really dominate the hosts for the next few games - easy runs in the end often bolster sides and that is something Kohli would not be willing to see.Zimbabwe Despite their heavy defeat, Zimbabwe need not be ashamed of themselves. Two of their batsmen, Sikandar Raza and Chigumbura, gave a good account of themselves against an Indian attack that was largely disciplined. The opening stand between Raza and Vusi Sibanda yielded a solid 72 but the pace at which those runs came would worry Brendan Taylor. Kyle Jarvis looked like creating some extra pressure with the ball and when he removed Dhawan early for 17, Zimbabwe were hoping to see more of a fight from the rest of the bowlers in an attempt to push India a little.Rohit fell, chasing a wide one from Chigumbura but thereafter the 159-run partnership between Kohli and Rayudu completely took the game away from Zimbabwe. Coach Andy Waller had said he would be happy even if his wards surprised India in one game, but for that to happen, the bowlers would have a major role to play against some in-form Indian batsmen.Raza's cultured 82, after being dropped early on the innings would have been pleasing to the eyes. Here was a young man, playing against the best ODI team in the world, making the most of an opportunity. He was too slow in the first half of the innings but accelerated well later on. Chigumbura used all his experience to come up with a brilliant cameo as Zimbabwe pushed towards a respectable score.Strengths and weaknesses The batting looks good for Zimbabwe. Raza is in nice form, Chigumbura is always there with some useful runs, Sean Williams is fresh from a good series against Bangladesh, while their best batsman, the skipper Taylor is a treat to watch when in full flow. However, it is the bowling that would need to step up and put up a fight if they have to even run India close.Quotes"I definitely feel that he's the best in the world right now in the one-day format. He made it a lot easier for me, and I was just looking at the way he was constructing his innings. It's a very good learning experience." Ambati Rayudu"We need to take our chances against a quality side like India. We did well with the bat, hopefully our openers will be more positive in the next few matches."
