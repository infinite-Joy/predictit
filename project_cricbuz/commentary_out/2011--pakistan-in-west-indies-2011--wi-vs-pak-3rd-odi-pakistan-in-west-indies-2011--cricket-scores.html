Hope that the rain stops and we will have some action pretty soon.Hello, and a warm welcome to one and all for the third One Day International between West Indies and Pakistan from the Kensington Oval in Barbados. Pakistan are sitting pretty with a 2-0 lead in the 5-match series and would love to seal the series today. On the other hand , West Indies would look for some sort of inspiration as they seek to save the series. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates.by Vishaal LoganathanPakistan will be aiming to win the series with 2 more games to play after having emerged comfortable winners in the first 2 games. Their performances have been clinical in both the games, with both departments ensuring that they were never outplayed. West Indies on the other hand have a lot to do to bounce back into the series.West IndiesThe West Indies have not had many bright spots in the series so far. Lendl Simmons has been their stand out batsman, with a couple of steady shows but the others have failed to come good.Marlon Samuels' return to the West Indies main team has been close to disastrous. He struggled during his last outing - managing to score 29 runs off 74 balls. At one stage, the once feared batsman was 3 off 36. Darren Bravo, Simmons and Dwayne Bravo hold the key for the calypso kings while batting and the trio have to come good if West Indies are to prevent going into last 2 games thinking about damage control.Their bowlers haven't been helped in both games by their batters putting up less than competitive scores. Devendra Bishoo has been the only bowler in their line up to have anything in the wickets column, getting 2 wickets each in the 2 games. The other bowlers have failed to cause any kind of positive impact against a disciplined Pakistan batting line up.PakistanPakistan have few lesser problems when compared to the West Indies, the biggest of the lot being their middle order not being fully tested yet.Their top order has come good in the series, and in fine style. Their top 4 look in good touch and Ahmed Shehzad's 100 in the last game will have given him truckloads of confidence. Their batters will have a pretty clear game plan for the 3rd ODI - do exactly the same as the first 2 ODIs.
