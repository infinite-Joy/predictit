Guptill is on strike. N Kulasekara will open the attackWelcome back. The second innings is just about to start with the Kiwis needing 219 to go 1-0 up in the 7-match series.Now, it is upto the Lankan bowlers to defend this total. With overcast conditions and a swinging ball, it could be a very interesting second innings. Join us in a short while for the run chase.Jayawardene and Jeevan Mendis did hit some lusty blows, but soon after Jayawardene got to his 18th ODI hundred, Sri Lanka lost wickets in a heap, including that of the centurion himself. At the end, they could only finish with 218/9. McClenaghan was the pick of the Kiwi bowlers as he picked up 4 wickets in total and out of those four, 3 came in the same over. Adam Milne gave him good company as well, taking two wickets. All the others bowled fine as well.New Zealand's bowlers used the conditions to good effect. There was some swing available at the start and they made good use of it, leaving Sri Lanka 16/2 at one stage. Dilshan and Mathews too failed to put on a partnership with Jayawardene and Sri Lanka were reduced to 82/4. After that Jayawardene and Thirimanne stitched together a 73-run stand to give some sort of respectability to the total before the latter departed.Sri Lanka will definitely be disappointed with the runs on the board. Winning the toss and batting first, 218/9 is not the sort of score you would look at and be happy. In fact, Jayawardene was the only real shining light for them in this innings.4

Boult will open the attackTeams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Shaminda ErangaNew Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Tom Latham, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Adam Milne, Mitchell McClenaghan, Trent BoultSri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batTalking about the team form in the ODIs, both teams won their last ODI series. Sri Lanka defeated England comprehensively (5-2), while New Zealand managed to edge out Pakistan in UAE, taking the series 3-2. Toss and teams coming up in a short while. Stay tuned.Sri Lanka will be boosted by the return of Dilshan and Jayawardene, who were absent during the Tests. In fact, Lasith Malinga, who is still recovering from his injury, is also a part of the squad. But, he is not expected to take part until the fag end of the series. For the Black Caps, Grant Elliot, who has been selected in the World Cup squad ahead of Neesham, will also be a part of the team.After the brilliant show they put up in the Tests, New Zealand will look to continue their good form in ODIs. The Kiwis have also adopted a player rotation policy to share their workload before the World Cup. In coherence with the policy, Ross Taylor and Tim Southee will sit out in today's game.After the drubbing they received in the Test series, Sri Lanka will look to bounce back in the shorter format of the game. With the World Cup not far away, these seven ODIs will definitely help both teams prepare for the mega event.Preview:New Zealand and Sri Lanka begin their final World Cup preparations in Christchurch from Sunday with the first of seven one-day internationals. The first game will also serve as a dress rehearsal for the World Cup opener to be played between the same two teams on the same ground on February 14.With two ODIs against Pakistan early next month as well, New Zealand have adopted a player rotation policy to manage their workload. Senior players Tim Southee and Ross Taylor will sit out the first game and Kyle Mills has not been considered as he continues to recover from injury."It's important we give all squad members an opportunity to perform and certainly there will be players who will be performing a role in these matches that they'll be expected to do at World Cup time," batting coach Craig McMillan said.New Zealand, with their tails up after beating Sri Lanka 2-0 in the recent Test series, have moved captain Brendon McCullum from the middle order to open with Martin Guptill.Sri Lanka have been reinforced by the addition of Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan and Lasith Malinga who were absent from the Tests. Malinga, like Mills, is still recovering from injury and is unlikely to feature until the tail end of the series. New Zealand spinner and former captain Daniel Vettori, who is heading to his fifth World Cup, said the Black Caps needed an overwhelming series win against Sri Lanka to be regarded as a force to be reckoned with."Everyone's starting to talk about the New Zealand team and if we can put up a winning series here, and a dominant series, that will only bode well for the World Cup," Vettori said on Saturday. "It's something the guys really want to focus on. Rather than stumbling into the World Cup like we've probably done in the past, we want to go in with all our bases covered and everyone firing."A focal point will be the continuing battle between Kumar Sangakkara and Trent Boult who dismissed the master Sri Lankan batsman cheaply in three of his four innings during the recent Test series. Sri Lanka will be counting on their batting strength with Sangakkara and Dilshan both ranked among the World's top 10 ODI batsmen, ahead of New Zealand's leading batsman Kane Williamson.Sangakkara and Jayawardene are also two of the most prolific ODI batsmen in the history of the game, sitting fourth and fifth on the all-time list, and Sri Lankan coach Marvan Atapattu said their success was vital. "Over the years, the older guys have maintained high standards, and the youngsters looking at them will be lifted because of that," he said.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Dimuth Karunaratne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Thisara Perera, Jeevan Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Suranga Lakmal, Dinesh Chandimal, Shaminda Eranga, Rangana Herath, Dhammika Prasad, Lasith MalingaNew Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Brendon McCullum(c), Kane Williamson, Grant Elliott, Tom Latham, Luke Ronchi(w), Corey Anderson, Nathan McCullum, Mitchell McClenaghan, Kyle Mills, Trent Boult, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Adam Milne, Daniel VettoriLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
