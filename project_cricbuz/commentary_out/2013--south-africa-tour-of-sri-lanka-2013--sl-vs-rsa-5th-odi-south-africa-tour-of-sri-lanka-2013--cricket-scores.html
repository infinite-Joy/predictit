We will want to end the series on a high. I am not unhappy that we are batting second. We have a good bowling line-up. Ryan McLaren and Aaron Phangiso are in the team."Angelo Mathews: "We are going to bat first. The wicket will get slower and lower as the game progresses. The senior players are our main strength. We are resting Mahela Jayawardene, Herath and Malinga. Kusal Perera, Senanayake, Lakmal are in the team."Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batPitch Report: Kumar Sangakkara says that he was looking for some moisture on this wicket but there is none.

The ground staff are expecting some rain and the pitch is covered.Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the 5th ODI between Sri Lanka and South Africa. The Hosts have already sealed the series 3-1 and will look to continue their winning streak. Stay tuned for the toss and the team updates.....PreviewSri Lanka and South Africa will not let the intensity slip in Wednesday's fifth and final one-day international in Colombo even though the hosts have already wrapped up the series. The day-night game at the Premadasa stadium will hold only academic interest as Sri Lanka gained an unassailable 3-1 lead following their eight-wicket win in Pallekele on Sunday. South African captain AB de Villiers said he wants a win to improve his nation's poor track record in Sri Lanka, where the Proteas have won just two of their 14 completed one-dayers going back to 1993. "There is a lot to gain from the last game," de Villiers said. "We have not won much in Sri Lanka, so we are very keen to finish on a high." "All of us, especially the younger players, are getting some experience of how to play in these conditions. That will be vital for tours in the future. Besides, every match that you play for South Africa is an important one, regardless of the state of the series," added the South African skipper. The skipper laid the blame for the series loss on poor batting on spin-friendly pitches. "What we need are a few 100s and some good partnerships," said de Villiers. "The bowlers have been playing good cricket, but we as batsmen have just not supported them well enough." "This is a chance to show what we are capable of with the bat. Every player in the squad takes pride in his performance and they will no doubt want to finish the series successfully," added AB. South Africa rested premier fast bowler Dale Steyn and leading all-rounder Jacques Kallis for the tour, while former ODI captain Graeme Smith was sidelined due to injury. Star batsman Hashim Amla was injured for two of the four matches and has batted just once in the series, making 77 on Sunday. Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews insisted his side was looking to add to the tourists' woes by winning the last match to make it a 4-1 scoreline. Sri Lanka have decided to rest the senior troika of Mahela Jayawardene, Lasith Malinga and Rangana Herath from the final match here tomorrow. Mathews, asked if he planned to test the strength of the bench on Wednesday, said: "We have not taken a call on that, but our main target is to win the series 4-1." "We might make one or two changes, but we certainly don't want 11 freshers coming in. In our line-up, we have just three seniors, while the rest are all young players." Former captains Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan have once again provided stability to the batting, with Dilshan and Sangakkara contributing a century each. The one-day series will be followed by three Twenty20 internationals starting in Colombo on Friday.
