Watson is on strike. Anderson will open the attackEngland will be happy with this batting effort. After a mediocre show in the previous 2 games, the batsmen rose to the occassion to help post a huge total. The start was far from good as they lost their captain in the 3rd over. But from then on, Prior and Trott took control of the innings and took England to an aggressive start. The duo added 113 runs for the 2nd wicket with Prior shrugging off his poor form to score a quick fifty. But just when it seemed like England would run away with the game, Australia fought back through its spinners. Steven Smith and Xavier Doherty bowled tight spells to curb the run rate. Smith, helped by some ordinary batting by the England middle order,picked up 3 important wickets in the process. The game swung England's way once again, thanks to a well made century from Trott and some useful contributions from the lower middle order. The Aussie bowlers, barring some good spells from Smith and a few late strikes by David Hussey, looked very ordinary. Australia would be looking to their batsmen to give take them to a series win, while England would believe they've given themselves a good chance of surviving.

A warm welcome to the live coverage of the 4th ODI between Australia and England. England face a must win situation to stay alive in the series while the Aussies look to extend their winning run going into the World Cup. This is Ajith and I will bring you all the action along with Karthik and Pradeep. We'll be back with the toss and the team line ups. Don't go away.Preview by Karthik LakshmananCan James Anderson?s return inspire a change in England?s fortunes? This is the question for which England will be seeking an answer ahead of their must win game against Australia in the CB series. England, in a span of 2 weeks, have realised why cricket is called a cruel game. Favorites to win the series after a comprehensive Ashes win, the visitors now find themselves at the receiving end, having lost all the 3 ODI matches so far.
The fact that the tables have turned is clearly proved by the form of their batting order. The batsmen, who scored big runs at will in the Test series, have found the going tough in the shorter format of the game. Injuries to key bowlers haven?t helped their cause either. Already having lost Tim Bresnan and Stuart Broad to injuries, England?s latest blow came in the form of a lower back strain for star spinner Graeme Swann. But the second string bowling attack comprising the likes of Tremlett, Shahzad and Yardy has actually fared well. In each of the games, they have managed to have the Aussie batsmen in trouble, but somehow fell just short of crossing the line. It is in this aspect that they will look up to the experience of James Anderson. The pacer, who returned to the English squad after getting a well deserved break post the Ashes, will be looking to make an impact straight away. It was in Adelaide that he took 6 wickets to give Australia their first loss in the Ashes, and the fast bowler will be keen to repeat the same in the ODI version.
Australia on the other hand are sitting pretty with 3 consecutive victories.But despite the mini winning streak, the current world champs will know that all is not rosy for them. The middle order woes, which haunted them in the Test series, continues to be a problem for the home team. In each of the games, they have relied too heavily on 1 or 2 batsmen, with the other batsmen failing. In the 1st game, it was Shane Watson who rescued the team to chase down a mammoth total. In the 2nd, Shaun Marsh scored a ton to save the day, and Australia made heavy weather of a moderate target before David Hussey steadied a sinking ship in the 3rd ODI. The home team too have their share of injury concerns; Shaun Tait and Nathan Hauritz are down with injuries while Mitchell Johnson has been suffering from a throat infection. But the bowling department does not seem to be affected by their absence. Bolstered by the return of Brett Lee and the form of Doug Bollinger, the bowlers have managed to bowl out England in all the games.
The 4th ODI promises to be a cracker of a game. England, after performing so well in the Ashes, will not want to leave Australia with memories of an ODI series thrashing. Australia on the other hand will be keen to win the series in Adelaide on Australia Day. A win would mean a lot more to them than just another ODI series victory. It would be the ideal preparation for the World Cup, and more importantly a consolation for the Ashes drubbing.Teams:Australia (From): Brad Haddin(w), Shane Watson, Shaun Marsh, Michael Clarke(c), Cameron White, David Hussey, Steven Smith, John Hastings, Brett Lee, Xavier Doherty, Doug Bollinger, Peter Siddle, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun TaitEngland (From): Andrew Strauss(c), Matt Prior(w), Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Paul Collingwood, Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan, James Tredwell, Ajmal Shahzad, James Anderson, Chris Tremlett, Tim Bresnan, Steve Davies, Steven Finn, Graeme Swann, Chris Woakes, Luke Wright, Michael YardyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
