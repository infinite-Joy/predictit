Raza was dropped by Wheeler on 67 and he made the most of it by helping himself to his third ODI ton. Well, it has to be said, New Zealand's bowling and fielding was below par in the last 10 overs. So, if it was Craig Ervine in the last game, it was Raza who bailed the hosts out of trouble with a courageous knock. Will the bowlers back Raza's valiant effort and seal the series? Join us back in a short while to catch New Zealand's chase..Mitchell McClenaghan troubled the Zimbabwean batsmen by testing them with a series of short deliveries. Top order faltered with Ish Sodhi creating extra problems with his sharp turn and bounce. At one stage when the home team were 68/5, it looked like they might end up with a modest total. Sikandar Raza and Sean Williams, however, put up a 60-run stand for the sixth wicket before the latter was sent back by a smart run out. Raza carried on and played sensibly while Tinashe Panyangara gave him the much-needed support towards the end.4

Two slips in place as Henry steams in..Pitch Report: 'It's a brand new wicket. It looks pretty dry, there are some wide cracks, must help the spinners later on. Bat first,' reckons Ed RainsfordOne change for New Zealand. Colin Munro replaces James Neesham. Zimbabwe have named an unchanged eleven.Teams:Zimbabwe (Playing XI): Hamilton Masakadza, Chamu Chibhabha, Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sean Williams, Regis Chakabva(w), Sikandar Raza, Graeme Cremer, Prosper Utseya, Tinashe Panyangara, Chris MpofuNew Zealand (Playing XI): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Colin Munro, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan, Ish SodhiZimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to batDespite Ross Taylor's well composed hundred and Kane Williamson's 97, the visitors ended up on the losing side because of poor bowling. "It's a bit of a shame that we lacked penetration with our bowling," described a disappointed Williamson after the loss. The fact that apart from Nathan McCullum, none of the bowlers could get their names into the wicket column explains that they were not consistent enough with their lines and lengths. Will New Zealand make changes to their line up? Barring fitness issues, Zimbabwe are expected to field the same XI. More on the teams and toss in a short while. Stay tuned...A couple of days ago, Zimbabwe showed great skill to hunt down 304 and stun New Zealand. Can they do something similar today and achieve a rare series win over a Test playing nation? Hello and welcome to the second ODI of the 3-match series. Elton Chigumbura's move to promote the returning Craig Ervine up the order turned out to be a masterstroke as the left-hander bludgeoned the Black Caps bowlers to all corners en route to recording his maiden ODI hundred. Hamilton Masakadza's knock too was crucial for the hosts as he helped them lay a solid platform for the rest of his mates to tee off.Zimbabwe had been knocking on the doors for a while now. Away at Pakistan and at home against India last month, they turned in several impressive performances only to be denied at the cusp of victory. That run of near-misses ended after they managed to level the T20I series 1-1 against India last month and now, following a stunning seven-wicket in the first ODI against New Zealand, they stand a chance to complete a rare series win against a side that finished second only to Australia at the World Cup.If Kane Williamson and Co. thought they could afford to use the Zimbabwe series to slowly build momentum heading into the more strenuous assignment against South Africa, they were in for a rude awakening from Sean Craig and Hamilton Masakadza. New Zealand now have had just a day to reflect on their defeat before they set about turning the series around.Short turnarounds between games can go either way. On one hand, there is a chance to put the loss behind as a bad day at the office and get on the field afresh and on the other hand allows a a buoyant Zimbabwe chance to keep the momentum going.Date: August 4, 2015Time: 07:00 GMT; 12:30 ISTVenue: Harare Sports ClubWeather: Pleasant day with a high of 23 degrees Celsius.Team News:ZimbabweThe hosts would have been buoyed by the comeback of leading strike bowler Tinashe Panyangara, who after missing the final two ODIs against India, returned to prize out Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson and conceded just 50 runs in his 10 overs. Chris Mpofu, on the other hand, went for 84 in his ten and could be replaced by Neville Madziva. The batting remains Zimbabwe's biggest strength. The likes of Sikandar Raza batting as low as number 6 is a testament to the work put in by Dav Whatmore and Co. on the batting following an embarrassing 5-0 defeat to Bangladesh at the end of last year.Probable XI: Hamilton Masakadza, Chamu Chibhabha, Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura (c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Regis Chakabva (wk), Graeme Cremer, Prosper Utseya, Neville Madziva/Chris Mpofu, Tinashe PanyangaraNew ZealandDespite missing Brendon McCullum's pyrotechnics, New Zealand's top-order, with the presence of Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor has enough firepower to counter Zimbabwe's bowling attack. However, the backup bowling options were found out on a HSC surface that, as observed in the series against India, eased out considerably for the second innings. New Zealand have the option of bringing in Adam Milne, who can offer that extra pace that they need. James Neesham, having been left out of the World Cup at home, is only just making his return to the side and will want to improve his performance if he is to stake a claim to the main side.Probable XI: Tom Latham, Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson (c), Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Jimmy Neesham, Luke Ronchi, Nathan McCullum, Matt Henry/Adam Milne, Mitchell McClenaghan, Ish SodhiStats and Trivia:- Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor have put together 10 century stands in ODIs. India's Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly lead the chart with 26.- Martin Guptill is 56 runs away from becoming the 10th Black Caps batsman to score 4000 ODI runs.Quotes:"It's a little tough to bat first up with these early starts bu we will learn from the experience of the first game and adapt accordingly."New Zealand captain Kane Williamson remained upbeat despite the defeat in the first ODITeams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, James Neesham, Luke Ronchi(w), Nathan McCullum, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan, Ish Sodhi, Adam Milne, Ben Wheeler, Doug Bracewell, Colin Munro, George WorkerZimbabwe (From): Hamilton Masakadza, Chamu Chibhabha, Craig Ervine, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Regis Chakabva(w), Graeme Cremer, Prosper Utseya, Tinashe Panyangara, Chris Mpofu, John Nyumbu, Vusi Sibanda, Luke Jongwe, Neville MadzivaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
