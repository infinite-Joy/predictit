Hopefully, the rain stays away and we get a full game. Toss and teams in a few minutes, stay tuned.....Preview by Gokul GopalAfter a thrilling rain-curtailed encounter at Hambantota, which New Zealand won off the final delivery, the visitors will be looking end the series unbeaten when they take on Sri Lanka in the 3rd and final ODI. Although it is a Day match at Dambulla, rain is expected have a say again and Sri Lanka, while keeping their fingers crossed, will be hoping to get the combination right for this game after home-team skipper admitted to selection errors in the previous match.Sri Lanka: Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan have been in top form in the series with both scoring back-to-back fifties. The experienced pair will again have a key role to play while the hosts will also be hoping for Mahela Jayawardene to fire with the bat. Skipper Mathews has also got a fifty against his name in this series and he will be hoping to do well again. The only worry for Sri Lanka with be the form of Dimuth Karunaratne, who has had two failures on the trot.Nuwan Kulasekara picked up a four wicket haul in the second ODI but that was not enough to prevent New Zealand from getting past the line. Lasith Malinga and Mathews have not been as effective as they would have hoped for. Sachitra Senanayake, who was amongst the wickets in the last game, ended up conceding aplenty. Rangana Herath gave away 43 off his 3 overs in the previous match and it is unlikely that he will be persisted with. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka will be hoping that they come up with a disciplined showing in what is a must win game for them.New Zealand: While the visitors have taken a lead in the series, they have some issues to address when it comes to their batting. While the efforts of Tom Latham, Luke Ronchi and Nathan McCullum helped New Zealand clinch the thriller, the Black-Caps will be hoping for the top order to come up with a better performance. The absence of key players like Brendon McCullum, Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson provided the inexperienced players an opportunity to prove their prowess. While Latham cashed in in the last game, Anton Devcich and Colin Munro have not done much and will be hoping to make amends.New Zealand have a bunch of quality all-rounders and promising bowlers although they have not quite come to the party yet. Kyle Mills and Devcich were the pick of the bowlers in the first ODI while skipper Mills was the lone wicket-taker in the second match. Nathan McCullum has been tidy with the ball although he has not picked up too many wickets. The Black-Caps will be hoping for the bowlers to fire as a unit as they look to finish the ODI series on a 2-0 note.Team News: Sri Lanka are likely to leave out Herath for the final match while Thisara Perera may get the nod in place of the left-arm spinner. Sri Lanka have the option of roping in Kusal Perera in place of Karunaratne although they might look at giving the latter another opportunity. New Zealand are likely to go in with an unchanged eleven for this game.Quotes:With the two new balls, it's very hard for the spinners. You have to be a very good spinner to get away from the batsman.
