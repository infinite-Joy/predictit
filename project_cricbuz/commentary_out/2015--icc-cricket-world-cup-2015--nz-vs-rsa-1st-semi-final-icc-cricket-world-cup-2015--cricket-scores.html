NEW ZEALAND:42.5 42.5Steyn to Elliott, SIX, New Zealand have qualified for a World Cup final for the first time. What a blow from Elliott. What an innings he's played. Look at that roar from the Eden Park crowd. Ian Smith goes berserk on air. Length delivery from Steyn, a shocking ball at this stage of the innings, Elliott goes deep in the crease, shuffles across slightly, takes his front leg out of the way and smashes it high over long-on. Elliott punches the air in delight and has his hands aloft before Vettori hugs him. AB de Villiers is down on his knees. Oh my word! This is heartbreak for South Africa. Such a good team they have, but they somehow did not manage to hold their nerve under pressure. Morne Morkel is crying. Parnell consoles Morkel. Faf du Plessis looks gutted as wellThe field is well spread now
NEW ZEALAND:42.4 Steyn to Vettori, byes, 1 run, short of length delivery from Steyn, Vettori swings and misses, Elliott sets off, de Kock misses the stumps, Steyn collects the ball and has a shy at the bowler's end but misses. Had de Kock hit the stumps, Elliott would have been out. Vettori races across and dives, he would have made it even if Steyn had hit the stumps
NEW ZEALAND:42.3 Steyn to Vettori, FOUR, oh boy! Steyn is livid! How has he managed to hit that for four? Full toss and wide outside off stump, Vettori backs away and then somehow manages to stretch and guide it past backward point, third man is very fine and he can't get thereNew Zealand need 10 off 4 to win this game, but remember, 9 will take them into the final.Oops! Steyn is stretching his left hamstring. He calls for the physio. What drama! ABdV has a long chat with Steyn. The physio is attending to Steyn, who is down on the ground. The New Zealand substitutes come out with a drink and probably a message for both the batsmen. Also is this a ploy from Steyn to disrupt the batting momentum of the Black Caps? Meanwhile, chants of "Daniel Vettori, Daniel Vettori" reverberate around Eden Park. 
NEW ZEALAND:42.2 Steyn to Elliott, 1 run, full toss outside off stump, Elliott drives it uppishly, Miller rushes in from cover but it doesn't carry. He does well to get his body behind the ball, only a single availableNew Zealand need 11 to win, but 10 will be enough as a tie will see them through.
NEW ZEALAND:42.1 Steyn to Vettori, byes, 1 run, short of length delivery from Steyn, Vettori pulls and misses, Elliott races to get back on strike and he succeeds in stealing a bye
NEW ZEALAND:41.6 M Morkel to Elliott, 2 runs, he's mistimed it. And ohhhh! Behardien was right under the ball but Duminy came right across him and they spill it. Behardien had it covered at deep backward square. It was an easy catch for him but Duminy came running from fine leg, dived in front of him and put his mate off. Short delivery outside off stump, Elliott mistimes the pull high in the air, it should have been a wicket, but Duminy collided with Behardien. Meanwhile, both the Black Caps batsmen were ball watching and weren't running for a while. There was an easy third run, which the batsmen miss out on. This also means Vettori will be on strike. Will this come back to haunt New Zealand? It's 14 needed off 7 now.
NEW ZEALAND:41.5 M Morkel to Elliott, FOUR, what a shot! Morkel misses the length and bowls a juicy full ball outside off stump, Elliott shuffled across to the off-side, doesn't try to over-hit the ball, just lofts it over extra-cover and it races away for four
NEW ZEALAND:41.4 M Morkel to Vettori, 1 run, that is a brilliant save from Steyn diving full length to his right. Great committment, he stretches his right hamstring after fielding the ball. Vettori walks across the stumps and helps this short ball down to long leg, but he could get only one run
NEW ZEALAND:41.3 M Morkel to Elliott, 1 run, slower ball bumper outside off stump, Elliott under-edges the pull to mid wicket
NEW ZEALAND:41.2 M Morkel to Elliott, 2 runs, in the airrrrrr and it's landed safely between two converging fielders. Full and outside off stump, Elliott looks to slog this hard after clearing his front leg out of the way, du Plessis runs back from mid-wicket, Amla rushes in from the deep, but the ball beats both fieldersFine leg is back. Mid-off, mid-on and square leg in.
NEW ZEALAND:41.1 M Morkel to Vettori, 1 run, full toss, crashed hard. Oh, that's a great diving save to his left from Amla, stopped a certain boundary. Vettori hit that hard towards extra-cover, but Amla intervened at short coverMorne Morkel [8.0-0-48-3] is back into the attackDecent over from Steyn under the circumstances. New Zealand need 23 off the last two overs.
NEW ZEALAND:40.6 Steyn to Elliott, no run, a direct-hit would have been curtains for Vettori. Low full toss on the leg stump, Elliott flicks it straight to ABdV at short mid-wicket, Vettori was backing up too far, the fielder had a shy but missed
NEW ZEALAND:40.5 Steyn to Vettori, 1 run, backs away, Steyn fires in a yorker, somehow Vettori manages to squeeze it out to Rossouw at backward point, who dives to his right and stops the ball
NEW ZEALAND:40.4 Steyn to Elliott, 1 run, slower ball on the leg stump, glanced away to fine leg
NEW ZEALAND:40.3 Steyn to Elliott, 2 runs, oh dear, Quinton de Kock. A run-out chance goes begging. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, Elliott flicks it to backward square leg and wants two, rushes back, Rossouw fires a good throw adjacent to the stumps but in anxiety, de Kock fumbled and whipped the bails off without the ball. Elliott was well short despite a full length dive
NEW ZEALAND:40.2 Steyn to Elliott, 2 runs, nice hit, third man is very fine and Elliott guides it past backward point for a couple of runsDaniel Vettori, left handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:40.1 Steyn to Ronchi, out Caught by Rossouw!! What have you done Luke Ronchi? A nothing shot and it's a simple catch at deep square leg. He can't believe it! Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, a harmless ball in fact, Ronchi flicks but doesn't bother to keep it down, the fielder waits for the ball to come and swallows it easily. Maybe Ronchi was trying to go over mid-wicket. Anyway, Steyn has given a breakthrough for South Africa at a crucial time. Ronchi c Rossouw b Steyn 8(7) [4s-1]Steyn to Ronchi, THATS OUT!! Caught!!Dale Steyn [7.0-0-59-0] is back into the attack29 needed off 18. Remember, if it's a tie, New Zealand will go through to the final because they finished higher in the group stage.
NEW ZEALAND:39.6 Tahir to Ronchi, 1 run, low full toss outside off stump, Ronchi drives it down to long-off, the fielder makes a fine sliding save
NEW ZEALAND:39.5 Tahir to Ronchi, FOUR, what a shot! Just a flick of the wrists and away she went, someone would say! Flatter delivery on the leg stump, Ronchi flicks with a strong bottom hand grip and hits it over mid-wicket to pick up a much needed boundary
NEW ZEALAND:39.4 Tahir to Elliott, 1 run, 'caaaatch' is the cry from Tahir but it doesn't carry to the man, who was running to his left from deep square leg. Elliott pulled that off the back foot
NEW ZEALAND:39.3 Tahir to Elliott, no run, very full on the off stump, driven back to the bowler. This is a top over so far. Captain ABdV likes it
NEW ZEALAND:39.2 Tahir to Elliott, no run, on the leg stump, Elliott flicks it to mid-wicket
NEW ZEALAND:39.1 Tahir to Ronchi, 1 run, googly on the stumps, not sure if Ronchi picked it, but he's managed to tap it to pointImran Tahir [8.0-1-33-0] is back into the attack36 to get off 24 balls. Don't take your eyes off this!
NEW ZEALAND:38.6 de Villiers to Ronchi, 1 run, oh that is a great effort from ABdV! He flies to his right in no time after delivering the ball as Ronchi drove this uppishly to long-on, unfortunately for South Africa, Ronchi hit it hard enough to beat ABdV's acrobatic dive
NEW ZEALAND:38.5 de Villiers to Elliott, 1 run, slogs very hard but hits it straight to deep square leg. A couple yards either side of the fielder would have been more runs
NEW ZEALAND:38.4 de Villiers to Elliott, SIX, in the airrrr and all the way! Timely hit this from Elliott. Too short from de Villiers, no pace whatsoever to trouble the batsman, who rocks back and pulls it high over deep square leg
NEW ZEALAND:38.3 de Villiers to Ronchi, 1 run, driven nicely but Behardien is stationed very straight at long-on
NEW ZEALAND:38.2 de Villiers to Ronchi, no run, on the off stump, defended back to the bowler
NEW ZEALAND:38.1 de Villiers to Elliott, 1 run, full and outside off stump, Elliott drives it to long-offJamie, who's watching from the ground isn't sure if it hit the spidercam wire, but it went miles up in the air, Faf waited for an eternity before holding onLuke Ronchi, right handed bat, comes to the creaseAlright, 46 to get off 30 and South Africa have a new batsman to work with. What an over that was from Morkel. Just one run in it and the big wicket of Anderson.
NEW ZEALAND:37.6 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, out Caught by du Plessis!! Is there a twist in the tale? This is the just the breakthrough South Africa wanted at this stage. Slower delivery shortish and outside off stump, Anderson goes for the pull but gets a top edge, it goes high in the air, square leg settles under it and holds on to the skier. That was a very good catch from Faf, who had his hands outstretched in joy, while he was flat on the ground. Faf is pumped and he gets a pat from Steyn. Oh hang on! They are checking if the ball hit the spider cam. Anderson is waiting near the boundary. Not sure if the ball flicked the string on its way down. The third umpire says it's fine and Anderson has to go. Remember, if the ball had touched the wire, it would have been a dead ball. End of a terrific knock from the all-rounder. Corey Anderson c du Plessis b M Morkel 58(57) [4s-6 6s-2]M Morkel to Corey Anderson, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
NEW ZEALAND:37.5 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, no run, short and down the leg-side, big appeal for catch from de Kock as Anderson misses the hook, but umpire Gould wasn't keen. No bat or glove involved
NEW ZEALAND:37.4 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, no run, almost knocked the leg stump out! Anderson doesn't move his feet while trying to run it down to third man, the short of length delivery just nips back in and goes just over the stumps
NEW ZEALAND:37.3 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, no run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Anderson is cramped on the cut and he picks out point
NEW ZEALAND:37.2 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, no run, steeply rising short of length delivery on the stumps, Anderson hops and keeps it out
NEW ZEALAND:37.1 M Morkel to Elliott, 1 run, dabbed down to third man for an easy singleMorne Morkel [7.0-0-47-2] is back into the attack
NEW ZEALAND:36.6 de Villiers to Corey Anderson, FOUR, short and pulled in the air, more importantly pulled in the gap. Anderson wasn't impressed after playing the shot and shook his head as he knew it was airborne and not too far away from Amla, who moved to his left. Short and down the leg-side, Anderson sends it between backward square leg and short fine leg
NEW ZEALAND:36.5 de Villiers to Corey Anderson, 2 runs, slogged across the line, not great timing but it goes wide of long-on and it's good enough for a couple of runs. Good running from Elliott as he quickly raced back for the secondVernon Philander is off the park.
NEW ZEALAND:36.4 de Villiers to Elliott, 1 run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Elliott pulls it to deep square leg
NEW ZEALAND:36.3 de Villiers to Elliott, no run, huge shout for LBW, not given and South Africa don't have their review. Short of a length delivery just shaping back in, Elliott goes across the line and gets an inside edge onto pad
NEW ZEALAND:36.2 de Villiers to Corey Anderson, 1 run, short of a length delivery outside off stump, Anderson goes hard at it and ends up flat-batting it to long-off. The timing wasn't great though
NEW ZEALAND:36.2 de Villiers to Corey Anderson, 1 run, short of a length delivery outside off stump, Anderson goes hard at it
NEW ZEALAND:36.1 de Villiers to Corey Anderson, no run, very full, drilled back to the bowlerAB de Villiers [1.0-0-3-0] is back into the attackNew Zealand have scored 35 runs in the 4-over batting powerplay, but more importantly, have not lost a wicket. It's down to 55 off 42 now.
NEW ZEALAND:35.6 Tahir to Corey Anderson, 1 run, every single run is being cheered. South Africa are under serious pressure. Flighted from Tahir, driven to long-on
NEW ZEALAND:35.5 Tahir to Elliott, 1 run, on the leg stump, driven down to long-on
NEW ZEALAND:35.4 Tahir to Elliott, FOUR, excellent hit to bring up fifty. Flighted delivery outside off stump, Elliott doesn't try to over-hit the ball, just lofts it over extra-cover with the spin and gets four more. Big cheer from the capacity Eden Park crowd

NEW ZEALAND:35.2 Tahir to Corey Anderson, 1 run, a sensational fifty under pressure from the youngster. He's scored at a brisk pace as well. This is his 4th ODI fifty. Flighted delivery outside off stump, Anderson drives it to long-off and raises his bat to acknowledge the applause
NEW ZEALAND:35.1 Tahir to Corey Anderson, FOUR, short and outside off stump, cut very hard, Amla dives full length to his left but it's not good enough. Amla moved from cover-point but Anderson hit it in the gap

This is well within their reach. South Africa need a couple of quick wickets.More from Jamie as the match veers towards a tense finale: Crowd getting behind every ball. They can sense something special. But its a tricky situation. Loud boos after Morkel pulls up.
NEW ZEALAND:34.6 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, 1 run, driven to mid-off and he'll keep strike
NEW ZEALAND:34.5 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, FOUR, goes aerial, there is no one at long-off and it's a misfield as well. Fullish delivery outside off stump, Anderson goes for the loft, he was looking to go straight but the bat turned in his hands and it went wide of mid-off, AB gave chase from mid-off, he dived very early, the ball hit his elbow and then the knee pushed the ball to the rope. AB is very disappointedMorne stops as he was about to release the ball and the crowd boo him.
NEW ZEALAND:34.4 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Anderson dabs it to point, Rossouw makes a diving save to his right
NEW ZEALAND:34.3 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, no run, oops! Anderson gets hit on the box. He feels a bit of pain, but he's fine though. Short of a length delivery on the leg stump, Anderson tries to work it on the on-side, but gets an inside edge and gets hitMilne, Ronchi and Shane Bond have a bit of smile in the dressing room. Looks like that New Zealand change room is relaxed
NEW ZEALAND:34.2 M Morkel to Elliott, 1 run, fullish and outside off stump, Elliott flicks it to deep square leg
NEW ZEALAND:34.1 M Morkel to Elliott, SIX, has he hit that well enough? Yes, he has! Short of a length delivery just outside off stump, Elliott slogs across the line and sends it high over deep square leg, there is no one in the deep and that is a safe shot. Great start to the over for the Black Caps
NEW ZEALAND:33.6 Steyn to Elliott, 1 run, nice and full on the stump, Elliott drives it down to mid-on, ABdV flies to his left and makes a diving save, deflects the ball towards mid-off, he recovers and dives again but doesn't get there. Anyway, Tahir was there in position to stop the ball
NEW ZEALAND:33.5 Steyn to Elliott, 2 runs, in the airrrr but just wide of the fielder. Faf it was at cover, who was diving full length to his right. Full and outside off stump, Elliott doesn't control the drive on the rise and gets away with it. Tahir runs back from mid-off to save two
NEW ZEALAND:33.4 Steyn to Corey Anderson, 1 run, lets the length ball to come and and guides it late to third man, they think about the second run as the throw goes towards mid-wicket, but there was a man backing up
NEW ZEALAND:33.3 Steyn to Elliott, leg byes, 1 run, short of length delivery down the leg-side, Elliott fails to glance it away and it rolls off the thigh pad towards backward square leg
NEW ZEALAND:33.2 Steyn to Elliott, no run, attempts a lazy dab away from the body, but the outswing on this short of length delivery beats him all ends up
NEW ZEALAND:33.1 Steyn to Corey Anderson, 1 run, good length delivery on the off stump, Anderson dangerously guides the ball very late to third manComing back to that run-out miss, the throw came in on the half-volley, but AB, who was so excited to effect the run-out, broke the stumps with his hand without the ball. He fell over, but tried to run Anderson out on the second attempt, still couldn't uproot the stumps. Even while lying flat on the ground he tried to pull the stumps out, but couldn't. Is that the game? Dale Steyn, who had a good view, knew straightaway that they've missed a great opportunity.Jamie chirped in to say that there was a mellow rection from the crowd when AB came onto bowl, but there was a huge roar when he fluffed that run-out chance
NEW ZEALAND:32.6 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, 1 run, short of length delivery just outside off stump, dabbed to short third man

NEW ZEALAND:32.2 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, no run, oh he decides to take the bat away at the last moment to this good length delivery. He could have easily dragged that back onto the stumps
NEW ZEALAND:32.1 M Morkel to Corey Anderson, FOUR, smashed! Full and outside off stump, Anderson drives very hard, mid-off was very square and he had no chance. That was hit with immense powerMorne Morkel [5.0-0-30-2] is back into the attackNew Zealand have taken the batting powerplay. Remember, it's only for 4 overs. In fact, ABdV was coming in to bowl, but since they opted for the powerplay, he threw the ball to Morne.
NEW ZEALAND:31.6 Steyn to Elliott, FOUR, Morne Morkel can't stop it at third man. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Elliott guides it gently, the Giraffe runs to his right, tries to stop it with his right hand, but the pace on the ball was too much for him and he couldn't make a clean stop
NEW ZEALAND:31.5 Steyn to Elliott, no run, fullish and outside off stump, Elliott drives it to cover
NEW ZEALAND:31.4 Steyn to Elliott, no run, short delivery outside off stump, Elliott left alone
NEW ZEALAND:31.3 Steyn to Elliott, no run, what a moment! Surely an easy run-out but ABdV failed to hold his nerve under pressure. South Africa needed to break this stand. Fullish delivery outside off stump, Elliott defends it to point, Corey Anderson races for a run but Elliott sends him back, the throw comes in adjacent to the stumps, but de Villiers, who rushed in from mid-on, couldn't stop himself in time and his hand hit the stumps before grabbing the ball as he couldn't control the momentumRun-out check sent upstairs. This is a big moment in the game. Has ABdV broken the stumps without the ball? Anderson is the man in question. Oh no! Looks like he doesn't have the ball while disturbing the bails. "I need a closer angle," says umpire Llong. He gets a different angle. "Two bails are off and there is no ball involved, so it's not out," adds Llong.
NEW ZEALAND:31.2 Steyn to Corey Anderson, 1 run, driven along the ground but there is a man sweeping on the off-side
NEW ZEALAND:31.1 Steyn to Corey Anderson, no run, Anderson was late to defend this one but he manages to keep it out though. This good length delivery shaped back in and almost went through the gate

NEW ZEALAND:30.5 de Villiers to Corey Anderson, 1 run, good length delivery outside off stump, Anderson drives hard, de Villiers tries to grab the ball in his followthrough, but fumbles and it goes to mid-on
NEW ZEALAND:30.4 de Villiers to Elliott, leg byes, 1 run, full and down the leg-side, Elliott misses the flick and is hit on the pad, the ball rolls to square leg and Anderson takes a run. The ball was going down the leg-side and the umpire wasn't interested in the appeal for LBW

NEW ZEALAND:30.2 de Villiers to Elliott, 1 run, bit of inswing on this attempted yorker, Elliott whips it away through backward square leg. New Zealand bring up their 200, much to the delight of the capacity crowd at Eden Park
NEW ZEALAND:30.1 de Villiers to Elliott, no run, short of length delivery just outside off stump, defended back to the bowlerAB de Villiers, right-arm medium, comes into the attackWow! This is interesting, ABdV brings himself on. I think he's got a wicket every match he's bowled in the last 4-5 games.It was Corey Anderson, who decided to take the mantle of steering New Zealand to victory by thrashing a few boundaries. He then bludgeoned Philander for a six over deep square-leg and took full advantage of a full toss from Duminy by tonking it down the ground for another six. At the other end, Grant Elliott has played with composure.JP Duminy landed a crucial blow by getting the wicket of Ross Taylor, with Quinton de Kock showcasing sharp reflexes to take the catch down the leg side. Vernon Philander, on occasions, troubled the batsmen with subtle seam movement. With Philander, it feels like batsmen struggle to pick any hints from his wrist position and he hardly gets the ball to move in the air. It is only after pitching that he surprises the batsman with seam movement. Unfortunately, Philander also undid the good work by invariably bowling a loose delivery every over. If South Africa win this game, the credit has to go to Imran Tahir as he has bowled parsimoniously. New Zealand's batsmen have certainly not picked Tahir's googly.
NEW ZEALAND:29.6 Steyn to Corey Anderson, no run, oh! He's missed the pull shot and they appeal for a caught-behind. Not a convincing appeal though. Short of a length delivery just outside off stump, Anderson goes on the back foot and tries to pull, the ball skids on and probably kept a bit low as well and beat Anderson. Top over from Steyn, who went for 46 runs in his first four overs
NEW ZEALAND:29.5 Steyn to Corey Anderson, no run, wow! He wants a sighter. Full and outside off stump, left alone
NEW ZEALAND:29.4 Steyn to Elliott, 3 runs, driven nicely and in the gap as well at cover. ABdV races back from mid-off, the ball slows down and helps his cause as well, he puts in the slide and throws the ball back but Elliott quickly takes the third run and pushes his partner
NEW ZEALAND:29.3 Steyn to Elliott, no run, full and outside off stump, driven towards cover, where Miller is so swift to get to the ball and prevent a run
NEW ZEALAND:29.2 Steyn to Elliott, no run, a tentative poke away from the body and Elliott is beaten all ends up. Maybe just a bit of shape away from the right-hander on that occasion, Elliott looks to defend but gets away with it
NEW ZEALAND:29.1 Steyn to Elliott, no run, fullish and on the stumps, Elliott defends it towards mid-onDale Steyn [4.0-0-46-0] is back into the attackSteyn returns with one slip.
NEW ZEALAND:28.6 Duminy to Corey Anderson, SIX, he's lost it! A friendly full toss and Anderson is not going to miss out. South Africa will have to be very tight with the ball if they are to pull this off, can't offer freebies and Anderson has absolutely smashed this over long-off
NEW ZEALAND:28.5 Duminy to Corey Anderson, 2 runs, oh dear! That's a bad ball but he's got away with that as Amla tidies up in the deep. Slider down the leg-side, Anderson helps it past short fine leg, deep backward square leg runs to his left and saves two

NEW ZEALAND:27.5 Tahir to Corey Anderson, 1 run, Anderson goes on the back foot and tries to pull this short ball, but mistimes it to long-on. Maybe the ball kept a bit low on that occasion
NEW ZEALAND:27.4 Tahir to Elliott, 1 run, defends this googly off the front foot to backward point and gets off strike
NEW ZEALAND:27.3 Tahir to Corey Anderson, 1 run, the Giraffe (Morne) needed to do a better job. Googly outside off stump, Anderson cuts off the back foot, short third man dives to his left, but doesn't manage to stop the ball cleanly

NEW ZEALAND:26.5 Philander to Elliott, no run, beaten! This good length delivery just nips away off the deck and beats Elliott's attempted dab down to third man
NEW ZEALAND:26.4 Philander to Elliott, FOUR, full and in the slot, an excellent front foot drive and even a full length dive to the left by the fielder at cover wasn't good enough. Elliott didn't try to over hit the ball, just timed it to perfection and it raced away. Philander bowled three dots balls in the over, but all the good work has been undone
NEW ZEALAND:26.3 Philander to Elliott, no run, Philander keeps the good length close to the off stump, Elliott gently defends it into the off-side
NEW ZEALAND:26.2 Philander to Elliott, no run, pushes this with an angled bat towards point, Rossouw makes a diving save to his right and keeps the batsmen calm. Elliott was looking for a run there
NEW ZEALAND:26.1 Philander to Elliott, no run, fullish and outside off stump, Elliott defends it towards coverOne slip in place.South Africa are slighty ahead at the moment but that hasn't doused the enthusiasm in the crowd. They are still cheering the home team on, says JamieDrinks are on the field now. The game is still in the balance. The run rate is fine for New Zealand, wickets in hand will be the key. On the other hand, if South Africa are to travel to Melbourne, they need wickets and wickets at regular intervals. We are all set for a cracking finish!
NEW ZEALAND:25.6 Tahir to Corey Anderson, no run, googly again just outside off stump, cut to point this time

NEW ZEALAND:24.5 Philander to Corey Anderson, 2 runs, Philander drags the length back, Anderson is quick to go back and pull it in front of square, he didn't middle it, hence only the couple

Unfortunately from their perspective, Guptill was run out on the back of a terrible mix up with Taylor. Taylor isn't exactly known for his good judgment while taking singles. With dew factor coming into play, it may just help out the batting side.With New Zealand losing wickets in quick succession, AB de Villiers missed a trick by not utilising Imran Tahir's services when Ross Taylor first took strike. It was obvious that de Villiers wanted to get through the fifth bowler's quota, but it just allowed Martin Guptill and more importantly, Taylor to pick up useful runs. Guptill even clobbered JP Duminy for a six. Vernon Philander, who suffered at the hands of Brendon McCullum made a good comeback. He extracted subtle seam movement to occasionally trouble the batsmen.

NEW ZEALAND:1.6 Philander to Brendon McCullum, FOUR, poor first over from Philander. Baz has straightaway put pressure on him. Remember he is playing his first game after many days. Back of a length delivery, McCullum gets inside the line and whips it behind square leg, fine leg was inside the ring and that was easy pickings
NEW ZEALAND:1.5 Philander to Brendon McCullum, no run, another one that comes right off the middle, but a nice field set by ABD. He has stationed himself right on the edge of the 30-yard circle at mid-off, McCullum finds him with a crisp drive

NEW ZEALAND:0.4 Steyn to Brendon McCullum, SIX, what a way to get going. Shortish and sat up nicely for Baz outside off, McCullum stands up and forehands it over extra cover, short boundaries carry the ball all the way
NEW ZEALAND:0.3 Steyn to Brendon McCullum, no run, shortish and outside off, McCullum looks to flay it over point, but the extra bounce does him thereTakes a bit of time to put it on and in the meantime Guptill walks up and has a chat with him.
NEW ZEALAND:0.2 Steyn to Brendon McCullum, no run, what happened there? McCullum's right shoe comes off. Short of a length delivery, McCullum goes back to defend, he knocks it towards cover, loses his balance and falls over. That was because his shoe came off
NEW ZEALAND:0.1 Steyn to Guptill, 1 run, edged and just wide of the fielder. Graeme Smith on air was excited as Doull tells him to take it easy. Fullish and on off, Guptill brings his bat down at an angle, the outside edge flies to the left of backward point and down to third manGuptill and Brendon McCullum are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Steyn will open the attackThe South Africans are in a huddle. ABD is having a pep talk before they enter the field. Most of the Proteas have a towel with them to keep the ball dry. McCullum and Guptill are in the middle. The latter will take strike. This is going to be one heck of a chase if these two get going. Steyn has the new ball. He will start with two slips. Here we go...Boult: "Yeah, it is. Credit to the South African batsmen for pushing it to 280 odd. 40,000 people do that to you (referring to the nerves at the start of the innings). We are familiar with this wicket, it is all upto us now. Let's see what we can do."The deck is good for batting and with short boundaries in place, New Zealand still have a chance of chasing down this target. However, their batsmen need to handle the pressure of playing a knockout game. Earlier, Trent Boult produced a fine exhibition of swing bowling to give New Zealand a slight edge. Hashim Amla and de Kock couldn't make their mark as Boult snared their wickets. However, du Plessis and Rilee Rossouw soothed the tangle of nerves in the dressing room with a fine stand. Once Rossouw was dismissed on the back of a stunning catch taken by Martin Guptill at backward point, de Villiers burst forth with a wide range of versatile shots.de Villiers even showcased his ability to play strokes in a 360-degree arc by essaying delectable shots through the third man region. His deft touch echoed cheekiness in stroke-play. Their opponents, New Zealand, would rue the fact that Kane Williamson dropped a tough chance at the cover region. In fact, it wasn't a great day for New Zealand in the field as they missed a series of half chances. In a big game and against a formidable opponent, those chances need to be taken. du Plessis played with steady perfection and looked unfazed by the loss of early wickets. He mainly targeted straight boundaries. However, once du Plessis reached his fifty, he played with precise metre of timing to nonchalantly loft Matt Henry for a six. It was a quality knock from du Plessis. de Villiers too crafted a splendid innings. He cut, drove and pulled; unhurried and languid. de Villiers also effortlessly essayed strokes down the ground with a stamp of authority. It was in the 33rd over of the innings when de Villiers cracked a couple of boundaries off Henry to send warning signals to the opposition. He also took a heavy toll of some poor bowling by Corey Anderson to tonk him for 15 runs in the 36th over. The way de Villiers came down the track and pulled Anderson for a six, gave a glimpse of his shot-making ability. It continued to rain fours and sixes from de Villiers' bat as he bisected gaps in the field with customary ease. In the backdrop of a charged up atmosphere created by a raucous crowd, Faf du Plessis and AB de Villiers constructed marvellous knocks to take South Africa to a very good total. For a while rain stopped play and New Zealand now will chase down a D/L adjusted score. Once play resumed after a rain break, David Miller cracked power-packed shots to put them in a position of strength.So, South Africa finish on 281 in their 43 overs. Time to get the calculators out. The final D/L target for New Zealand would be somewhere close to 298. Let's just wait for the final confirmation. Alright, we have the revised target, New Zealand need 298 runs in 43 overs, just under 7 rpo.4

Umpire Gould even signalled it a wide. The front foot is good says the third umpire. Can you zoom in on the glove? Asks the TV umpire. He wants a much closer look on that. The RTS is coming up now. There is a spike on the Snicko. Ian, I have got clear evidence. You are on camera, you can change your decision. The finger is raised and Faf is walking back to the pavilion.

ABD and Faf make their way out to the middle. The former walks in practising a few swings with the bat. Anderson is on top of his run-up. Baz making the last minute field changes.18:30 Local Time, 05:30 GMT, 11:00 IST: South Africa were in the middle of the batting powerplay and had 2 more overs left, but that has been cancelled. New Zealand will have 9 overs of mandatory powerplay and 4 overs batting powerplay. Three bowlers can bowl 9 overs while 2 can bowl 8. So, Boult and Vettori have finished. Southee, Henry and the other (Anderson/Williamson/Elliott) bowler have to bowl the 5 overs.18:26 Local Time, 05:26 GMT, 10:56 IST: Play to start at 18:45 local time. The match has been reduced to 43-overs per side. Meaning, that South Africa have only 5 more overs to bat. We'll keep you updated on the revised playing conditions.18:14 Local Time, 05:14 GMT, 10:44 IST: Loud cheer from the crowd at Eden Park as the covers are being removed. The groundsmen are working on drying the outfield. The big rope is being used to clear the water. There is a lot of water gathered on the cover as well. So, it will take a few minutes before play resumes.18:06 Local Time, 05:06 GMT, 10:36 IST: Rain has stopped. It is clearing up and blue skies hover across the west side of the ground. Still no update on how many overs will be deducted. The BlackCaps just tweeted this a minute back, "The rain has stopped at Eden Park. No action from the groundsmen yet. A few of the punters are returning to the uncovered seats. #nzvsa"17:50 Local Time, 04:50 GMT, 10:20 IST: Well, it's been an hour since play was stopped. We'll start losing overs from now.17:40 Local Time, 04:40 GMT, 10:10 IST: We only start losing overs after play has been halted for an hour. Till now it has been only 50 minutes. And some good news from Eden Park as the covers are being peeled off. Strike all that. The covers are back on. It's that kind of a day. Jamie strolled out to check on the weather and that's when it started to drizzle again.17:32 Local Time, 04:32 GMT, 10:02 IST: Another update from Jamie, he says, the rain has slowed down. Hopefully, it is for the good this time. The rain has cleared in the background. Just waiting for it to completely stop.17:25 Local Time, 04:25 GMT, 09:55 IST: Oops! The rain has gone a bit heavier says Jamie. With the rain easing off, the umpires were expected to have a look at the conditions shortly, but for now, they will have to postpone their inspection.17:10 Local Time, 04:10 GMT, 09:40 IST: There is a reserve day, just to keep you informed, but the rain is not all that heavy and there is nothing threatening on the radar as well. As I type this, Jamie says that the rain is easing off.17:01 Local Time, 04:01 GMT, 09:31 IST: It is still raining out there. South Africa would hope that this is just a short delay as these two are looking solid to score at a brisk rate. If overs are lost and D/L comes into play, New Zealand could have a bit of an advantage, especially with shorter boundaries. A 12-minute delay was good enough to spoil South Africa's party 23 years ago. Fingers crossed.16:51 Local Time, 03:51 GMT, 09:21 IST: The rain has arrived and the umpires have called for the covers. It's not all that heavy though. The hessian comes on before the plastic sheets are put in place.

SOUTH AFRICA:30.2 Matt Henry to du Plessis, no run, back of a length outside off, not short to pull, but du Plessis goes through with the shot, right off the toe-end and the ball rolls to short coverWondering why a couple of paras of text have popped in? Then let me remind you that, we are detailing events that have happened every 10 overs. So that you don't miss out on anything. So that's why you will see text coming up after the end of every 10 overs. Just a heads up!
SOUTH AFRICA:30.1 Matt Henry to de Villiers, 1 run, back of a length outside off, de Villiers taps it to deep square legMatt Henry [5.0-2-9-0] is back into the attackOn occasions, Rilee Rossouw hasn't looked convincing against spin in his brief career. However, he too looked in fine touch when facing up to Daniel Vettori. Rossouw then tonked Grant Elliott for a six. At the other end of the spectrum, New Zealand's captain, Brendon McCullum, continued to look for wickets. He is known for trying out a part-timer and it shouldn't surprise anyone that he introduced Kane Williamson into the attack. Williamson could have produced the vital breakthrough by snaffling the wicket of du Plessis, but New Zealand didn't go for a review after the on-field umpire turned down an appeal for lbw. Just in the nick of time, it was Corey Anderson, who took the wicket of Rossouw as the raucous crowd came back to life. Anderson certainly has a habit of breaking partnerships. Credit also has to go to Martin Guptill for plucking a catch out of thin air at backward point. It was Faf du Plessis, who looked to shore up South Africa's innings. du Plessis believes in the old maxim of playing each ball on its merit. He used his feet to loft Tim Southee and then played a crisply timed shot down the ground to collect a couple of boundaries in the 21st over. du Plessis targeting straight boundaries just goes to show that he is a street-smart cricketer.

SOUTH AFRICA:26.1 Corey Anderson to Rossouw, out Caught by Guptill!! What.A.Catchhhhhh! The crowd come to life once again. Caught one-handed and Corey Anderson strikes. The golden arm of the Black Caps has done it again. Short of a length outside off, Rossouw opens the face of the bat and punches, it was flying to the right of point and swerving away from Gups, but he moved and stretched his long right-hand and voila it stuck. That was a screamer - one more added to Gups' ever-increasing collection of astounding catches. Rossouw c Guptill b Corey Anderson 39(53) [4s-2 6s-1]Corey Anderson to Rossouw, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

SOUTH AFRICA:23.1 Vettori to Rossouw, no run, bit of extra bounce for Vettori as Rossouw gets forward to defendComing back to that loud shout for lbw, all three reds on Hawk-Eye. But the umpire gave it as runs. If New Zealand had reviewed that, du Plessis would've have been gone. There was a loud appeal from KW but he didn't review. Will that prove costly?

Replays show that it had pitched in lineWilliamson stays around the wicket to du Plessis
SOUTH AFRICA:22.1 Williamson to Rossouw, 1 run, low full toss from round the wicket, Rossouw gets forward and drives it to long-onKane Williamson, right-arm off break, comes into the attackApologies for mentioning that Rossouw has come in ahead of AB. Thanks to my ever attentive colleagues who spotted that error. Except for one game in the tournament, AB has never come in at 4, ahead of Rossouw.

SOUTH AFRICA:20.1 Southee to du Plessis, no run, the gentle outswinger goes full and outside off stump, du Plessis drives and picks out the man at short cover"He [Henry] swings the ball late, has got a quick bouncer and he bowls wicket-taking deliveries," Peter Fulton, Canterbury's skipper, was quoted as saying by Stuff.co.nz. Interestingly, Henry has a history of being troubled by back problems. In 2012, he even had a major surgery on his lower back. Henry gave a good account of himself as well by keeping the opposition in check. Daniel Vettori, the wily slow left-arm orthodox, was also introduced into the attack. For South Africa, it was Rilee Rossouw, who looked to break the shackles with a fine shot down the ground off Boult. Faf du Plessis played with a calm head on his shoulders.With Brendon McCullum looking for wickets, Trent Boult was given a lengthy spell. To make it intriguing, Boult bowled with five fielders in the slip cordon. It was Matt Henry, who replaced Tim Southee at the other end. Henry doesn't just hit the bat hard, but can also generate swing with the new ball. It is always good to have a pacer, who hits the bat hard in the shorter forms of the game. He has been bowling with good rhythm too as Henry snared six wickets for Canterbury against Central Districts in Nelson just a few days ago.

SOUTH AFRICA:18.1 Southee to du Plessis, no run, walks across the stumps and defends the length ball back to SoutheeTim Southee [4.0-1-14-0] is back into the attackDidn't have the time to mention about Rossouw's promotion ahead of AB. Now is the time to apologise and mention it. The move has worked well so far. Boult vs AB was the battle everyone were expecting to see. But AB has pulled off a fast one over B Mac. Kept himself back for the late charge and could well prove to be a masterstroke. Will it turn out to be a match-winning one? Only time will tell. But AB has certainly caught New Zealand off-guard by that decision. New Zealand wouldn't have expected that

SOUTH AFRICA:16.1 Matt Henry to du Plessis, wide, short and down leg, wide calledMatt Henry was called in to replace Adam Milne and he leapfrogged Kyle Mills and Mitchell McClenaghan in the playing eleven. Must be nervous times indeed. But he has gone on to bowl 2 maiden overs on a trot. Jamie feels that the reception from the Auckland crowd must have eased him in. Here's more: 'Lovely atmosphere. The crowd chanting Henry's name was quite something. He must have fed off that. What a field to get from McCullum too. Fine spell from the World Cup debutant,' he says.Drinks are on the field now. That was some 70 minutes or so of action. Phew! The Eden Park is the place to be today. A fitting venue for a World Cup semi-final. Crowd at their raucuous best. Almost rowdy like. In a good and sporting way that is. Wanting their team to win. A dot is cheered loudly, while a boundary is met with pindrop silence. Thrilling stuff
SOUTH AFRICA:15.6 Vettori to du Plessis, 1 run, this drifts into du Plessis, who turns it to deep backward square leg for a single

SOUTH AFRICA:13.4 Boult to Rossouw, 1 run, dug in short, Rossouw pulls to deep backward square leg
SOUTH AFRICA:13.3 Boult to Rossouw, FOUR, too full from Boult and that's a perfect on-drive from Rossouw. Shows the full face of the bat and leaves mid-on on his knees. Driven to the long-on fence. Timing, class and all that jazz
SOUTH AFRICA:13.2 Boult to du Plessis, 3 runs, and again Dan is the man running after it. Short-arm pulled wide of him at mid-on and Eden Park egg him on as he chases. Dan has an easier job on that occasion and pulls it back well inside the rope. Still another three
SOUTH AFRICA:13.1 Boult to Rossouw, 3 runs, shortish on the stumps, Rossouw short-arm pulls through mid-wicket. 'Go Dan' says Graeme Smith on air as Daniel Vettori sprints and pulls it back with a slide, saves a run for his side. Terrific committment shown by Dan

SOUTH AFRICA:12.1 Matt Henry to du Plessis, no run, outswinger, outside off, left aloneJamie chirps in to say that the sun is out. The South African batsmen will surely welcome the warmer conditions.
SOUTH AFRICA:11.6 Boult to du Plessis, 1 run, short of length on the hips, tucked to deep backward square leg, for a single
SOUTH AFRICA:11.5 Boult to Rossouw, 3 runs, this is manic cricket. Inswinging yorker from Boult, dug out hard onto the pitch by Rossouw, it bounces over Boult and B Mac sprints and dives head-first to pull it back. Vettori backs up and nearly catches Rossouw short, with a throw that had the batsman diving to make it back. The throw misses and they take three. What action
SOUTH AFRICA:11.4 Boult to Rossouw, no run, wide of the crease and Rossouw finds Elliott at short cover-point. Boult applauds the effort by clapping. It was driven to the right of the fielder who stops it with one hand. KW, Guptill came up to Elliott to pat him too

SOUTH AFRICA:10.5 Matt Henry to du Plessis, no run, Elliott is all smiles. Ian Gould is all theatrics as he is a bit slow to move away from the line of that throw. Elliott dived full length to his left at mid-on and stopped a fierce drive, got up and unleashed a back-hander that missed the stumps. Saw Rossouw out of his crease and threw, but Rossouw was back by the time the throw came
SOUTH AFRICA:10.4 Matt Henry to du Plessis, no run, now swing for Matt Henry, outswinger, nice carry to Ronchi after du Plessis lets it go

SOUTH AFRICA:10.2 Matt Henry to du Plessis, no run, back of a length outside off, pushed to cover
SOUTH AFRICA:10.1 Matt Henry to du Plessis, no run, that bounced a bit. du Plessis was pushing forward to defend, was surprised by that and adjusted well. Takes his bottom hand off and jerks his head backBoult's effort paid rich dividends as Amla edged one onto the stumps. Boult looks for wickets by pitching the ball up with the new ball and Brendon McCullum backs him up with aggressive fields. On the other hand, when in good form, Amla with those magical wrists is able to bisect the minutest of gaps in the field. However, when up against a left-armer bowling from over the wicket, it is risky to drive on the up as the ball may carry on with the angle. Boult continued to bowl with good control and was rewarded with the wicket of de Kock. de Kock has a habit of using his feet to the pacers, but this time around, lost his wicket.With a heightened anticipation, fans made a beeline for entry into the Eden Park stadium for the mouth-watering semi-final clash between South Africa and New Zealand. The New Zealand swing duo of Trent Boult and Tim Southee started on a good note. Boult swung the ball prodigiously and produced the edge off Quinton de Kock's bat, but Luke Ronchi dropped the catch behind the stumps. Southee, who has a fine surprise bouncer up his sleeve, then induced a top-edge from Hashim Amla as he looked to hook him. Fortunately for Amla he survived.

SOUTH AFRICA:8.4 Matt Henry to Rossouw, no run, full and on the stumps, driven back to Matt Henry
SOUTH AFRICA:8.3 Matt Henry to du Plessis, 1 run, du Plessis for sure is nervy. He pushes this to mid-on and sets off. Doesn't realise that this is Eden Park and he has played that too well, has to dive and gets there as Elliott shoots sideways and misses. Would've been interesting had there been a direct hitThe reaction of the Eden Park crowd said it all after de Kock was out. They were up on their feet, roaring and fist-pumping. One man was seen pumping his fist so vigorously. Raw passion on display
SOUTH AFRICA:8.2 Matt Henry to Rossouw, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Rossouw hops and punches it to the left of point. Quick single taken

SOUTH AFRICA:7.6 Boult to Rossouw, no run, how do you play that? First up! Play that if you can Rossouw. All the slip fielders who are 5 in the cordon come up to the bowler and pat him on the back. Boult sticks his tongue out. This was on a good length and it holds its line, Rossouw actually did well to play inside the line and the ball missed the outside edge. Since Rossouw played inside the line, he survivedRilee Rossouw, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:7.5 Boult to de Kock, out Caught by Southee!! Boult is now the highest wicket-taker for New Zealand in World Cups. He has 21 to his name. de Kock is dragging himself off Eden Park. He doesn't want to leave. That was a poor stroke. Charged Boult, wanted to go over cover, but the late swing took the outside edge and landed safely in third man's hands. Southee didn't have to move an inch. Boult is all smiles as he is surrounded by his mates. de Kock c Southee b Boult 14(17) [4s-2]Boult to de Kock, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

SOUTH AFRICA:6.4 Southee to du Plessis, no run, short of length outside off, du Plessis pushes out away from his body, finds cover
SOUTH AFRICA:6.3 Southee to de Kock, 1 run, de Kock played that well, short outside off, de Kock rolled his wrists and kept it down to deep square leg. Was aware of the fielder there and wanted not to find the fielder
SOUTH AFRICA:6.2 Southee to de Kock, no run, full and inswing for Southee, late too, de Kock's bat turns and his clip can only find mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:6.2 Southee to de Kock, wide, double-bluff that. But Southee in attempting the yorker gets it wrong, the inswinger goes wrong, down legMcCullum is so pro-active as captain. He is changing the field constantly. Three slips and a man now on the hook at deep square
SOUTH AFRICA:6.1 Southee to de Kock, no run, short of length on off, de Kock wants to force that hard off the back foot but finds mid-wicket, as the inside half of the bat is found
SOUTH AFRICA:5.6 Boult to du Plessis, no run, angles it in, but this one is still not enough to make du Plessis play. Another testing over from Boult comes to an endBoult has decided to come round the wicket for the last delivery
SOUTH AFRICA:5.5 Boult to du Plessis, no run, pitched up outside off, du Plessis thought about the drive, crouched low to play and then decided against it as it was too far wide of off

SOUTH AFRICA:5.3 Boult to du Plessis, no run, very full and wide of off, du Plessis leaves once more

More for Boult than Southee. It's a sell-out at Auckland but the stadium isn't a full-house at the moment
SOUTH AFRICA:4.6 Southee to du Plessis, no run, another outswinger, but this one is on a short of length outside off, easy for du Plessis as he lets it go

SOUTH AFRICA:4.1 Southee to de Kock, no run, short of length on middle, de Kock tucks it to mid-wicket, calmly played
SOUTH AFRICA:3.6 Boult to du Plessis, FOUR, superbly played by du Plessis. It was the attempted yorker from Boult and he almost got it right out, but du Plessis flicked that past backward square leg, just the uncorking of the wrists at the right moment and the ball raced away
SOUTH AFRICA:3.5 Boult to du Plessis, no run, pushed across du Plessis on the left-armer's angle from over the wicket, du Plessis gets forward and shoulders armsFaf du Plessis, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:3.4 Boult to Amla, out Bowled!! Look at the Eden Park faithful roar. Boult is all smiles. He has knocked Amla over, albeit off an inside edge. It was full and wide outside off, was there for the drive, but Amla had been nervy all innings, the feet didn't move on the drive and the inside edge clattered back onto the stumps. Did the ball swing back in a bit? No. It went across with the angle. Amla b Boult 10(14) [4s-2]Boult to Amla, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!Phew just 21 balls into the innings and so much action. My fingers will go if this continues for the entire match
SOUTH AFRICA:3.3 Boult to Amla, no run, dug in short, Amla ducks under that
SOUTH AFRICA:3.2 Boult to de Kock, 1 run, too straight from Boult, de Kock flicks that to deep square leg, gets away to the other endThree slips and a gully in. Deep square in place
SOUTH AFRICA:3.1 Boult to de Kock, no run, Boult beats de Kock outside off, with a short of length delivery outside off, it pitched outside off and went away, de Kock was pushing out and did well not to go hard at that
SOUTH AFRICA:2.6 Southee to Amla, FOUR, and now on the pads, Amla won't miss out. Flicked wide of mid-wicket. Cleanly struck and that spoils the over
SOUTH AFRICA:2.5 Southee to Amla, FOUR, poor bowling. Southee loses his patience, drifts a half-volley outside leg, all it needed was bat and Amla flicked it away to the fine leg fence. Too easy
SOUTH AFRICA:2.4 Southee to Amla, no run, edged and doesn't carry to 2nd slip. All action in this over and in this game as well. Amla late in withdrawing the bat from that back of a length delivery outside off, the edge is found, but short of the slip cordon
SOUTH AFRICA:2.3 Southee to Amla, no run, outswinger, left alone
SOUTH AFRICA:2.2 Southee to Amla, 2 runs, in the air and just wide of the running and diving long leg fielder. The luck is with South Africa at the moment. Top-edged hook from Amla, he was not in control of the shot at all. Southee followed the path of the ball as long leg (Boult) ran to his left, but the fielder, despite diving full length didn't get even a finger on it
SOUTH AFRICA:2.1 Southee to Amla, no run, short of length outside off, defended comfortably off the back foot towards mid-off
SOUTH AFRICA:1.6 Boult to de Kock, no run, full on the stumps, de Kock gets his front foot across and plays around it. Flicked to mid-wicket. Dangerous that from de Kock. Excellent over from Boult
SOUTH AFRICA:1.5 Boult to de Kock, FOUR, dropped by Ronchi! Big moment. Brilliant delivery from Boult, full and late swing, on off, de Kock made the mistake of playing to leg, closed the bat face and the outside edge went to the left of the diving Ronchi, it was right in between Ronchi and first slip. Credit to Ronchi for going for it, went full length but could only palm it away to the third man fence. The left mitt got there, but only the edge of the mitt. Not the middle. de Kock gets away
SOUTH AFRICA:1.4 Boult to de Kock, 2 runs, half-volley outside off, Boult searching for swing and de Kock opens the face of the bat to drive wide of point, only a couple
SOUTH AFRICA:1.3 Boult to de Kock, no run, outswinger, but on a fuller length and outside off, de Kock sees it well and leaves
SOUTH AFRICA:1.2 Boult to de Kock, FOUR, edged and just wide of the third slip diving to his left. Boult brought de Kock forward and the defensive stroke found the edge, but it eluded the diving fielder's outstretched left-hand
SOUTH AFRICA:1.1 Boult to de Kock, no run, what a delivery first up! Short of a length and outside off, late movement away, de Kock spars at it and is lucky not to edge it. Very minimal footwork from de Kock as he didn't go across to play itFalse start for Boult. He runs in and just as he was about to deliver the ball, the ball popped out after hitting the thigh. Boult manages a smile on the way back. He has to start all over againTrent Boult, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:0.6 Southee to Amla, no run, a huge roar from the Eden Park faithful after Southee finishes with a maiden over. Amla gets back and across, before punching to point. That was a very good opening over from Southee
SOUTH AFRICA:0.5 Southee to Amla, no run, Amla shuffles across to defend and presents the full face to play it to mid-on. Southee has a wry smile on his face as Amla had lost his balance while playing that, stumbled forward awkwardly and did well to get the bat in front of the pad, although the bat came at an angle around the front pad
SOUTH AFRICA:0.4 Southee to Amla, no run, KW at point dives to his right and saves some runs. He gets a pat on his back from another fielder after that was stopped. It was on a fuller length outside off and Amla drove well, looked like a boundary until KW went across
SOUTH AFRICA:0.3 Southee to Amla, no run, and another delivery that swung, but only after the ball passed the batsman, close to a wide as it was well outside off, but the umpire reckons that it was fine
SOUTH AFRICA:0.2 Southee to Amla, no run, there is the first indication of swing for Southee, bowls it on a good length and it's an outswinger, Amla shoulders arms watchfullyIt will be interesting to see how much swing Southee and Boult get on this. They will swing, but how much?
SOUTH AFRICA:0.1 Southee to Amla, no run, short of length outside off, Amla gets back and across, is on the hop, but drops it to cover. Played that awkwardly, signs of nerves?Amla and de Kock are at the crease. Amla is on strike. Southee will open the attackA huge roar accompanies Southee as he runs in. The Eden Park crowd are already into itCloudy and grey at the moment. Southee has the new ball. Three slips in place. The countdown begins. Game on! And you bet ya! It is. Here we come then...National anthems time and cue for some raw passion from both the sides while singing it. AB amidst all that manages a smile. Fair play to him. What a man. Time for emotions, passion and all that to now be displayed on the pitch. That's where it all matters. The camera focusses on Matt Henry who wipes his sunglasses. Amla and de Kock walk out. Ross Taylor is seen egging on his mates.Pitch Report: "The sun is out. The ground looks an absolute picture. The teams should have a good understanding of the short boundaries. India chased down 280 against Zimbabwe here. There is a bit of grass covering, but there is no green tinge to it whatsoever. It's very hard. There should be some decent carry," reckons Shaun Pollock.Rain was expected in Auckland today but it has turned out to be a pleasant day. How's the mood at the ground and what are the conditions expected today? Jamie has more here: Playing field cleared. Both teams inside their dressing rooms. Drums playing to help set the mood. Many empty seats but the lines outside the ground indicate they will fill up fast. Clear skies, temperature at a pleasant 22 degrees. Superb day for a superb semi-final.Teams:New Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Trent BoultSouth Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Rilee Rossouw, David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran TahirSouth Africa have won the toss and have opted to batMcCullum: "It's a quick turnaround. A really good game for us in the quarter-final and we witnessed some special things. Our boys are really excited to be a part of the semi-final. Obviously we are up against a very good South African team and I am sure it will be a great contest. We would have batted first as well. But with the cloud coming over hopefully it will swing for us. The boys have been really good. We have drafted in Matt Henry into the squad and he's going to play in place of Adam Milne today. It's a huge opportunity for him. He's a wicket-taking option. We just felt that he was just the best guy to be there in that first-change position. We'll go in with an attacking mindset and hopefully good things will happen today. It's really tough on them (Mills and McClenaghan). They've both taken it in their stride as all the guys who haven't played a great deal in this tournament have. We just felt that with the extra pace that Matt (Henry) offers and he's a bit of a wicket-taker as well. We thought if in doubt go for the aggressive option and that's what we've gone for today. It's not going to be handed to us. We need to go and get it and the boys are certainly ready for it. We've had a great campaign so far. All the boys have loved the support that we have had all around the country and now it all comes down to one day and we are confident that we'll play well. Hey, if South Africa is good enough, then fair play, we think we'll play well as well."de Villiers: "It's been very good, we are hell of a lot excited to be here today. Eden Park, with all the tradition and history and all the great games in the past, it fires up a little bit more to play a good game of cricket today. We are going to have a bat first today. Looks a good wicket. We rate ourselves against their bowling attack and hopefully we will get a good foundation set and then cash in. We are not really focussed on the weather to be honest. We are just every excited to be out here and start really well. We've got one change, Vernon Philander comes in for Kyle Abbott. Everyone has been playing good cricket. Verny (Vernon Philander) is in great form, faced him in the nets a little bit and I am excited to see what he can achieve today. He (Abbott) was superb. He's a great team player for us and I am sure he understands and maybe he'll get a chance in the final if we come through today."Toss time folks!Our man Jamie is at the ground, he says "The ground is slowly starting to fill up with people milling their way through the turnstiles. Plenty of Black Cap jerseys on show. And Matt Henry has bowled a fair bit and might turn out to be the X factor."BBC's TMS have tweeted that Matt Henry is marking his run-up in the warm-ups. That would suggest he will come in, in place of Adam Milne. What a story that would be. Henry can bowl quick and is a like-for-like replacement for Milne. Can understand the logic.AB de Villiers: "There's a lot of confidence behind us. I feel the team is in a really good space at a really good time. We've got a lot of reason to be confident for tomorrow's game."Quotes: Brendon McCullum: "I'd expect that the team that is able to handle the crunch situations the best will come out on top, but I would expect that the margin won't be too far between both teams."Weather update: A maximum of 22C is predicted for the game. More from the Metservice.com website: "An improving story, still the risk of a few showers to start the innings but sunny spells returning for this afternoon. Light northeasterly winds."South Africa: South Africa in all likelihood will play the same side that crushed Sri Lanka in the quarter-final. Philander may come into contention for his extra batting skills, but still Abbott is likely to retain his spot.Pre-match team news, New Zealand: Adam Milne's injury means the Kiwis have to make a change. It will be interesting to see whether Matt Henry is rushed straight in or Mitchell McClenaghan is given another go, despite a poor game against Bangladesh. If both Henry and McClenaghan aren't considered then Kyle Mills - with all his experience - will get the nod. That should be the only change to an otherwise settled line-up.Head-to-head record between the two teams: In World Cups - both sides have played each other six times with New Zealand winning four, with the last encounter being the famous quarter-final win at Mirpur four years ago. In the last five meetings though, South Africa have won three in a row that included a 2-0 series win in New Zealand last October."On Tuesday at Eden Park, McCullum's New Zealand team - unbeaten in the World Cup - will face South Africa in the first semi-final in what looks a tantalising match. Will this great ground prove lucky for New Zealand, 23 years on from 1992? A packed house will be waiting for the answer.""It was here that England were beaten in 2002, South Africa in 2004 and India in 2014. It was here a few weeks ago that Brendon McCullum's team beat Australia by one wicket when chasing 152 in front of a packed house chanting "You're worse than England" to the opposition. However, Eden Park will always be tagged with the 1992 World Cup for four matches from New Zealand's memorable campaign - three for wins and one for heartbreak."How can we not mention the iconic Eden Park at all. We have focussed on so many things but Eden Park. Time to rectify that mistake. Our man in New Zealand, Jamie Alter has penned this special piece on Eden Park. He writes - "Eden Park holds a special place in New Zealand cricket history. It was here in 1956 that the team achieved its first Test victory in 26 years, bowling West Indies out for 77 on the final day. It was here in 1982 that they beat Australia for just the second time in Test cricket. It was here in 1986 that Jeremy Coney's team beat Allan Border's side to take the series. It was here in 1993 that Martin Crowe's team beat Australia to draw a three-Test series."Mike Hesson also mentioned that Matt Henry will be considered for selection along with the others for the semi-final. "We brought Matt up as cover yesterday so he was going to come and train with us. He was obviously excited to come up here," he said. "When he heard this morning that he was brought into the squad, he's obviously pretty excited. I did his washing from last night, as well, so I think he's pretty keen to get that back. He's going pretty good. If Matt ends up in the squad, he'll be considered along with the others."Brendon McCullum backed Hesson's words. "Adam has been outstanding for us in that third seamer role throughout the tournament. Injuries happen, though, and in the end we've got some good cover amongst the squad, as well," he said. "It's really disappointing for Adam but he'll remain part of the squad, which is good, because he's a good team man, as well, good fellow to have around, and it's disappointing his tournament as such has ended, but I'm sure we'll come up with a suitable replacement.""It's not that it wasn't worth it, it's to a point now where he's unable to bowl. If he's unable to bowl, he's in a lot of pain when he bowls, he's fine walking in a straight line, but unfortunately when he bowls it's become increasingly uncomfortable, to a point where he's unable to carry on," he said. "It's one of those injuries probably for two weeks he's had issues with it, but he was pain-free come the quarter-final and got through that okay, but post-quarterfinal it's flared up to a point where, as I said, it's unsustainable."Milne's injury has left New Zealand "gutted", according to the head coach Mike Hesson. "It's [the injury] serious enough to rule him out of the tournament from a playing perspective, so we've still got more tests to do in terms of the extent of it, but we're thinking more weeks rather than longer than that," Hesson told reporters at Eden Park. "Adam got told this morning. We looked at different options, but it just wasn't going to work. Obviously a lot of disappointment. It's a once in a lifetime - well, hopefully it's not a once in a lifetime opportunity for Adam, but look, he's gutted and all the players are gutted for him. He's a popular member of the group, and hopefully he'll be around."In a major blow to New Zealand, their fastest bowler, Adam Milne was ruled out of the tournament with a left heel injury. Milne, 22, felt discomfort in his left heel when on the field during the win over West Indies in the quarter-final. Later he underwent an MRI scan that showed significant swelling. Milne has been replaced by Matt Henry and the ICC has approved of Henry as Milne's replacement."Three years later, Williamson is now the best batsman in the New Zealand team and his consistency has been remarkable. He will be aware of the threat Morkel and Steyn possess and he will be ready for yet another showdown. South Africa's deadly duo will not shy away from roughing him up. This contest between New Zealand's best batsman and South Africa's best bowlers will be pivotal in this match."Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn vs Kane Williamson - "Date: 27 March 2012. Venue: Basin Reserve. Morne Morkel was ripping through the New Zealand top order while Dale Steyn was ferociously working up the batsmen. However, both could not dislodge Kane Williamson and he brought up a magnificent century to save the Test match. During the course of his knock, Williamson was hit on the body by Steyn and the bowler refused to apologize. The unbeaten century in Wellington signalled the coming of age of Williamson.""Amla, though, must be aware of the threat posed by Trent Boult. New Zealand's ace left-arm fast bowler is the leading wicket-taker in this tournament, with 19 wickets at an average of 14.63 and an economy rate of 4.21. His variations in length and his ability to generate late swing make him a potent threat. Boult featured in the two ODIs against South Africa in October 2014 and failed to get rid of Amla. However, on the big stage, Boult will be determined to take out South Africa's most consistent batsman early."Trent Boult vs Hashim Amla - "There is a calmness around Hashim Amla when he comes to bat. He is the quickest batsman to get to 5,000 runs in ODIs and his huge appetite for runs gives South Africa the advantage at the top. Amla's ability to bat right through the innings will help South Africa on the big day."Always in a big game, there will be some key battles that could decide and shape the way the game unfolds. Here are three of them that we have picked for you. Brendon McCullum vs AB de Villiers - "It is a battle between two freaks. One has brute power while the other is exceptionally innovative. Both are proactive and can change the course of the match quickly. As far as contests go, this is definitely one of the mouth-watering battles of the World Cup.""South Africa's de Villiers is another who has led by example, getting his team to respond with intensity and purpose. Morne Morkel, for instance, bowls from a reduced run up to ensure that de Villiers does not cop another fine and risk sitting out of a game. The Proteas' skipper has never hesitated in appreciating or being critical of his team-mates."Our man G Rajaraman focusses on the two captains - McCullum and AB de Villiers. He writes: "McCullum brings a bit of a gambler's touch to leading New Zealand, embracing an all-out attack policy. He has backed his instinct not only when at the crease but also in goading other batsmen to ensure that the team has large totals to defend or chases down targets ruthlessly. Their bowlers have been as aggressive and brilliant echoing their skipper's approach.""Interestingly, it will be a semi-final between two teams that have never reached a World Cup final. This time, one of New Zealand and South Africa will be a finalist. New Zealand look a better side on paper, they are in form, and they are playing at home with confidence. I'm not putting anyone ahead, it's still 50-50. But, I just get the feeling, as I said at the start of the World Cup, that this could be South Africa's tournament.""New Zealand have been in the semi-finals before, but have never won. In the 2011 edition, they lost to Sri Lanka in the semi-finals in Colombo, but now they are playing in their own backyard. It is a semi-final at home, so no one can say that there's no pressure on themselves. The expectations will always be high."Sourav Ganguly writing exclusively on our site says the semi-final is too close to call. He reckons New Zealand are the form team, but this could be South Africa's World Cup. "It's very difficult to keep any one of these two teams ahead. There was a feeling that at the start of the World Cup, South Africa would do something special. They have had a pretty up and down group stage, but they emphatically went past Sri Lanka in the quarter-finals at the SCG. And now they face New Zealand, who have been in great form in the tournament along with India. It's hard to differentiate between India and New Zealand, but for me New Zealand, right through the tournament, have not put a foot wrong.""There has been a lot of emphasis on our past and South Africa not doing well at World Cups. We don't mind that too much. I've gone through the whole package of feeling emotional about it, fighting against it, then accepting it, then fighting again," he said. "Honestly I'm not putting emphasis on that at this World Cup at all. I'm the guy who's got to answer those questions, and I don't mind doing that, but I know the squad is in a really good space, and once again I'm going to say that sentence of knowing that if we play a good game of cricket we'll come out on top. We're that confident in our abilities as a cricket team," he said."I trust my gut feel with that. I get a feeling of what the energy is like," he said at Eden Park on Monday. "It's pretty easy to pick up when you've spent a lot of time with the guys, spent a few years with them, so I know each player individually pretty well. I know what makes them tick, and I know what irritates them, as well. Sometimes it's important to irritate them, to get the best out of them, as well. It's a matter of reading the situation, trusting my gut, and I don't think I'll have to trust my gut too much tomorrow because I know the guys will be up for it."AB de Villiers may have seen and been part of many South African sides that failed to win a knockout game in ICC events, but also has the distinction of being the first man to lead his side to a knockout win in a World Cup game for South Africa. He knows they can do it again. He believes it, truly he does."It will be no different to every other game, I think. We talk a lot about this being the greatest time of our lives and the trip that we've been on so far has been one that we'll all remember. The game is meant to be fun, go out there, express yourself, enjoy the occasion, put our best foot forward, and we'll see where the cards fall after that," said McCullum.What is all the pre-match talk ahead of the big clash? Let's find out. Brendon McCullum may be the most marked man in New Zealand at the moment, but he is relaxed and cool going into the biggest match of his career. "I think I should be okay," he said with a smile. "I sort of find that being too stressed out doesn't help that much, so might as well just relax and look forward to the opportunity to go out there and represent your country again tomorrow in obviously a really big game. It's a great stage to be a part of. It's what you play the game for, all the trainings that you do all the time away from home, all the hard work and sacrifice that you make. This is what you do it for, so we've got that opportunity tomorrow, and yeah, I'm looking forward to it."A fairly straightforward chase was complete with Quinton de Kock leading the way. He came back to form with 78 and saw his side home with still 32 overs of the game remaining. It was one of the most one-sided knockout games in World Cup history and South Africa had written a new chapter. They now meant business and sounded out a warning note to the rest of the pack still left in the competition.Quarter-final: They faced Sri Lanka at the SCG - with a dry surface predicted. Many experts reckoned the toss would be a huge factor. Mathews won the toss and had a significant advantage already. He chose to bat first and many felt that South Africa would once again bow out of the World Cup without winning a knockout game. But with the ball, South Africa came out like a pack of hungry wolves and simply blew the Islanders away. 133 was all that Sri Lanka could manage against the all-out intensity that the Proteas displayed. Steyn's reaction after getting Dilshan summed up how much the game meant to his side. He celebrated the wicket with his veins throbbing and eyes nearly popping out as he let out an almighty roar.South Africa, Group stages: South Africa had a mixed group stage. While they were brilliant against West Indies and Ireland, they faltered against India and Pakistan. Those two losses came when they were chasing and once again raised doubts about their ability to handle pressure in crunch situations. But convincing wins against UAE and Zimbabwe earlier in the tournament ensured that they finished second in the group behind India.Quarter-final: Martin Guptill made the highest ever score by a batsman in a World Cup knockout game as his unbeaten 237 powered New Zealand to 393. West Indies went hell for leather and lost by 143 runs. Guptill who was dropped on 4 made the West Indies pay heavily for their mistake as the Wellington crowd were treated to his wide range of strokeplay. With the ball, Boult snared the first four wickets and set his side on their way.Group stages: New Zealand were the only side apart from India to have a clean slate in the group stages. Played 6. Won 6. Beat Sri Lanka comfortably. Edged past Scotland. Annihilated England. Won a thriller against Australia in the game of the tournament. Eased past Afghanistan and then held their nerve to beat Bangladesh.How have New Zealand and South Africa got to the semi-final? A look back at the road to the semis starting with New Zealand.No less inspirational has been McCullum's opposite number - AB de Villiers. South Africa hadn't won a knockout game coming into this tournament, but right from the opening day he has backed his boys and exuded a calm confidence that this is their time. AB has batted, bowled, fielded and led the side superbly to show that he is not an ordinary individual. Some are even comparing him to Superman. That is how tall he stands at the moment. He knows there is history to be rewritten, with past failures serving valuable lessons and acting as a spur to right the wrongs.This after a dismal 2009 IPL campaign where he captained the Kolkata franchise to 10 defeats out of the 14 games. Luck didn't seem to be with him as one of the close games he lost proves. Against the then Deccan franchise, his side had the game in the bag with 21 needed off the final over. But somehow Mashrafe Mortaza and his side contrived to lose the game. There were a few other close defeats as well in that campaign, but none more heart-breaking or gut-wrenching as this. Back then McCullum was a novice captain still finding his feet. How his captaincy has come of age from then!One man who can set that record straight and take his side to glory is Brendon McCullum - the Black Caps captain. Let us focus on him in larger detail. McCullum describes himself as 'brash' and he has been inspirational ever since he took over the mantle of leading the side. Ever since losing the series against South Africa in October 2014. New Zealand have beaten Pakistan 3-2 in Abu Dhabi. Won 4-2 against Sri Lanka at home. Then defeated Pakistan 2-0 and won all their seven matches in this World Cup. That's 9 ODI wins in a row and counting. A large part of the credit should go to McCullum. He has revitalised and rejuvenated New Zealand cricket with his brand of attacking captaincy.Six-time semi-finalists. Zero final appearances. That's New Zealand's record in World Cups. Is there a jinx that surrounds the Black Caps? One will never know. In 1992 on their own soil, at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand were heavy favorites to go through. But then misfortune struck at the most inopportune time. Their charismatic and influential captain, Martin Crowe didn't take the field due to a hamstring injury in the second innings of that semi-final and saw his side lose to an inspired Pakistan. That defeat still rankles Crowe to this day.A couple of memorable quotes from that game before we move forward and focus on other things. The then, South African coach, Mickey Arthur after the defeat - "The monkey's almost become a gorilla now." While Jacob Oram was at his humorous best here: "Thankfully, I am 6ft 6in, and I replaced Kane Williamson who, I think, is 4ft 6in," he said about the Kallis catch."They targeted me as a youngster, so that is the advice I would give guys going to this World Cup. Some teams target guys who are younger and less experienced. New Zealand are brilliant at that, the Aussies as well.""That moment taught me a lot about myself. I learnt a lot about international cricket. I had always thought I enjoyed a challenge, but after that day I knew that I enjoyed a challenge. When there's pressure or when it's tough I like to try and stand up for the team. I learnt a lot about myself when I didn't stand back to those guys."Four years later he wants to rectify that mistake. He has got what he has wanted. A semi-final date with New Zealand. "In my perfect world I would like to play New Zealand in the semi-final and have that same situation arise again. But this time it will be the other way around. We'll be the team that's on top, and we can do the same to them," du Plessis said at South Africa's World Cup squad announcement on January 7.One man who wasn't smiling that day was Faf du Plessis. Four years back he was just a youngster and the dismissal of Kallis brought him to the crease. The Kiwis knew here was a man for the taking. In a high-pressure situation. And it worked. After Faf had ran AB out, Kyle Mills - on as a substitute to serve some drinks - chirped away. Even the sober, Dan Vettori joined in. Scott Styris, Tim Southee and Jacob Oram chimed away as the verbals were directed at Faf. It worked. Faf had been mentally thrown off. Soon he got out and then the innings nose-dived. The turning point of the game was not Kallis' dismissal, but AB's run-out, caused by Faf.What made it even more painful for the South Africans that day was one of their own, being in the other camp. Allan Donald smiled and celebrated after every South African wicket. Why? Because he was New Zealand's bowling coach in the World Cup. After New Zealand won he hugged John Wright, the coach. Seeing those scenes must have hurt South Africa even more. But then Donald was just being a professional. Now he is back in the South African camp. Will we see him smile once again?Jacob Oram who took the catch to dismiss Kallis felt that was the turning point of the game. "My catch [was a turning point], and I'm not just pointing that out because it's me, but because it broke a partnership that looked like it was starting to build. And the second moment which galvanised us to another level, and put the skids on them, was Martin Guptill running out AB de Villiers. That just seemed to make us all grow a foot taller, and you could see them getting a little worried."Graeme Smith, the Proteas captain was a broken man after the defeat and he had no words to describe how his side had lost. He sat a stunned man and could barely speak. "It's hard to describe [how we feel] at such short notice. It's kind of disbelief; I felt that we certainly had what it took to win," Smith said. "We've trained hard, we worked on our skills and I cannot fault the way this team has played. When we go home there's going to be swords and daggers. We are not the only World Cup team that has not gone on to win."The infamous Choke: 25th March 2011. A World Cup quarter-final between these two same sides. New Zealand had made just 221. South Africa were well placed at 108/2. Kallis was taking his side home. But then Big Jacob Oram plucked a catch on the deep mid-wicket boundary and the match turned. AB de Villiers was run out. The Kiwis smelt blood. Sledging began. Faf was psyched out with verbals. The inevitable happened. South Africa crashed out of the World Cup with a 49-run defeat. The pressure got to them. On the big night, they failed. Once again. Graeme Smith, the captain was a broken man. Pain was seen in every South African's eye that day. South Africa had 'choked' previously in World Cups, but this was a 'choke' that surpassed all the others. It was the perfect meltdown under pressure against a decent Kiwi attack on a slow pitch. The demons once again had reared their head and South Africa had nowhere to hide.Have a look at this stat - the winner of today's clash between New Zealand and South Africa will reach the World Cup final for the first time! Astounding! Can you believe that? I can't! But that is a stat as well as a fact. New Zealand or South Africa haven't made it to the summit clash in the biggest tournament of all. That sets us up nicely for what should be a humdinger of a game. So hello then, to one and all as we welcome you to the first semi-final of the 2015 World Cup between New Zealand and South Africa being played at the iconic Eden Park in Auckland.Sir Richard Hadlee. Glenn Turner. Martin Crowe. Ken Rutherford. Ian Smith. Chris Cairns. Stephen Fleming. Nathan Astle. Craig McMillan. Shane Bond. Daniel Vettori. Brendon McCullum. Ross Taylor. Allan Donald. Shaun Pollock. Hansie Cronje. Gary Kirsten. Lance Klusener. Herschelle Gibbs. Graeme Smith. AB de Villiers. Dale Steyn. Morne Morkel. Hashim Amla. And the list can include another dozen players. What is common amongst all these players? There is a link and we won't keep you waiting for long. It's obvious and here is the answer. In the above paragraph.Destiny is the perfect word available in the English language to describe both New Zealand and South Africa at the moment.12:00 Local Time, 23:00 GMT, 04:30 IST: Destiny - 'A predetermined course of events considered as something beyond human power or control.'Preview by Jamie AlterThis is it. New Zealand versus South Africa at the semi-final stage of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup. Brendon McCullum against AB de Villiers. Potential versus performance. Hope against hope. Nerves against the nervous. Neither country has ever won a World Cup semi-final. One of them will go to the summit for the first time. Who will blink first?Behind McCullum's New Zealand is a nation that has backed this team from well before the tournament began, and whose anticipation and belief has increased with every win. Behind de Villiers' South Africa are passionate supporters who somewhere inside feel that this is their year. Not all of them will admit it, but they do feel something different about this team.New Zealand are, of course, unbeaten in the World Cup. In their last game, Saturday's quarter-final in Wellington, they had Martin Guptill score the second-highest individual score in ODI history. They are pumped, confident, brimming with positivity. Their captain's leadership is infectious; contagious even, as Stephen Fleming put it. Tim Southee and Trent Boult (the leading wicket-taker in the tournament) have been hailed as on course to be New Zealand's greatest new-ball pairing. Daniel Vettori, apart from the last match, has been economical, accurate and successful. And when he had an off day with the ball, he plucked the catch of the tournament.The team has been dented by the ruling out of tearaway quick Adam Milne, as McCullum and the coach Mike Hesson admitted on Monday, but the confidence remains high. The hunger has not diminished. McCullum believes his team can still keep rolling."I sort of find that being too stressed out doesn't help that much, so might as well just relax and look forward to the opportunity to go out there and represent your country again tomorrow in obviously a really big game," he said. "It's a great stage to be a part of. It's what you play the game for, all the trainings that you do all the time away from home, all the hard work and sacrifice that you make. This is what you do it for, so we've got that opportunity tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to it. The boys are pretty excited."South Africa are here after beating Sri Lanka - finalists in the last two World Cups - in a one-sided Sydney quarter-final. They lost to India and Pakistan in the league phase but hammered other sides to make the knockouts. Twice they have made 400. De Villiers has a ballistic century to his name. Hashim Amla has been consistent. The weak link, wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock, scored a breezy fifty in the last match. Dale Steyn has increased in potency, the legspinner Imran Tahir has a five-wicket haul to his credit and four in the quarter-final to fetch him the Man-of-the-Match award. Morne Morkel has quietly supplied energy to back Steyn's pace and Kyle Abbott's consistency.Ahead of what he termed "one of the most important games" of his career, de Villiers spoke of what it felt like to lead South Africa in a World Cup semi-final. "Every time I wear that shirt, I feel like it's the most important game of my life. I'm not going to put too much emphasis and importance on this game, even though we know what it's all about. I think the guys know enough. No need to motivate them too much and tell them the importance of tomorrow. We know how important it is. It's a huge occasion for us," he said."I've mentioned in a few pressers before, that I believe that if we play to our full potential that nobody is going to stop us in this tournament. It's more important for me to get the guys in a good space to make sure they're confident mentally, they're fresh physically, because I know at the end of the day, if we rock up and play a good game of cricket that we'll come out on top."De Villiers confirmed that there were no injury concerns and stated that Vernon Philander had trained well for a few days and looked in good shape. Should Philander return, Abbott will have to miss out, which would be unfortunate for him because he has bowled well as Philander's replacement."The whole squad is ready to go, and there are a few boys that have put up their hands in the World Cup, so it's difficult. It's really difficult, especially after a win like the last one," said de Villiers. "It's tough to change the squad and the team that played. But, we might have to have a look at a couple of combinations, a couple of possibilities that might strengthen our team. Ideally, I would have liked to have turned out our team before the game, but yeah, we're pretty confident with our thinking process at the moment."Milne's injury has opened up a fast bowler's slot for one of left-armer Mitchell McClenaghan, who played just one match in the tournament and failed to take a wicket, or late add-on, Matt Henry, who has impressed with his raw pace in the eight ODIs he has played. Neither McCullum nor Hesson commented affirmatively on who would play on Tuesday. If you had to pick on one, it would be McClenaghan because he has been with the squad all tournament. Henry, 23, is coming off five first-class games for Canterbury from which he has taken 20 wickets, and to suddenly have to switch onto one-day international mode, and in a World Cup semi-final, may be too much.The weather forecast for Auckland on Tuesday is not all that good, with showers predicted on a day that could have temperatures going as high as 23 degrees. Fans of both teams will hope that good weather persists, and that the bat and ball take care of the thunder and lightning.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Rilee Rossouw, David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Dale Steyn, Kyle Abbott, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Vernon Philander, Farhaan Behardien, Aaron Phangiso, Wayne ParnellNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Trent Boult, Kyle Mills, Nathan McCullum, Tom Latham, Mitchell McClenaghanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
