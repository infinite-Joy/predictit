PAKISTAN:17.1 Mathews to Hafeez, leg byes, 1 run, length delivery from Mathews that is straying down leg, Hafeez tries to flick and misses. They take a quick single.

Interestingly, Shehzad made an attempt to get back to the crease, but his back heel seemed to be on the line and in the end the third umpire decides he has to take the long walk back to the pavilion. The batsman isn't happy, but if your back heel is on the line, it is out. This was also his 50th ODI wicket. Ahmed Shehzad st Chandimal b Senanayake 18(23) [4s-2]Senanayake to Ahmed Shehzad, THATS OUT!! Stumped!!A decision has gone to the third umpire for a stumping. The front foot is fine, it looks like Shehzad's heel is in the air or just maybe on the line, as the keeper whips the bails off in a flash. This can be a touch and go decision. They are trying to zoom the replay to make it more conclusive. The umpire in the end gives it out. A brave decision in the end

Gamage will open the attackWelcome back.. Gamage with the new ball..For the visitors, their fielding, which has largely been on the money in this series, was below par today. Among the bowlers, only Shoaib Malik bowled with good control for them. Even their trump card, Yasir, struggled to make an impact. The deck is flat, but for the visitors to win this game and go 4-1 up in the series, they need the top-order to get big scores.Kusal Perera's marvellous century and the 164-run stand he strung together with Dilshan piloted the hosts to a massive total. Perera and Dilshan gave the home team a rousing start by checking in a series of fine shots. They even handled the spin threat of Yasir Shah with ease. Perera was the more aggressive of the two, but Dilshan, too, with drives and cuts essayed shots to all corners of the ground. He also became the fourth Sri Lankan to compile 10,000 ODI runs. In the slog overs then, Angelo Mathews and Milinda Siriwardana landed hefty blows to take them to a position of strength. In fact, the pair smashed the opposition ranks to smithereens and collected 70 runs in the last five overs. This monstrous score is also their highest total against Pakistan in ODIs.4

So, after what has been a disappointing performance by Sri Lanka, can the hosts pull one back in the final game? Or will Pakistan yet again emerge victorious and add another two points to their kitty in the ICC rankings?Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kusal Perera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal(w), Ashan Priyanjan, Milinda Siriwardana, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Lahiru Gamage, Suranga LakmalPakistan (Playing XI): Azhar Ali(c), Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shoaib Malik, Mohammad Rizwan, Imad Wasim, Anwar Ali, Yasir Shah, Rahat Ali, Mohammad IrfanAzhar Ali: 'The wicket looks good, I would have batted first as well. Will look to capitalize with the new ball. We are playing the same team. The guys are doing well and we would like to have continuity. This is another game and another opportunity to perform.'Mathews: 'We will bat first. Looks like a good batting surface, will not turn a lot. We have got 3 changes. Malinga, Pathirana and Pradeep (injured) are out. We have brought in Thisara Perera, Senanayake and Lahiru Gamage . We will give opportunities to guys who we think will take us forward.'Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: 'It is a hard surface and there will be bounce on offer for the bowlers. Dean Jones reckons it is a 270-280 surface, but the pitch looks excellent for batting.'For the home team, most of their bowlers have struggled to make an impact. Even Lasith Malinga, the spearhead of the attack for many years, has snaffled a mere four wickets and has been expensive. On the brighter side, Lahiru Thirimanne and Dinesh Chandimal have played with guts and gumption with the bat in hand. The weather looks fine and hopefully, we will be in for a cracker of a contest. Stay tuned for the toss and teams...In the past, the batting has turned out to be the Achilles heel for the visitors. In this series though, Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Azhar Ali and Shoaib Maik have been amongst the runs. To make it even better, Rahat Ali, Yasir Shah, Hafeez and Anwar Ali have taken wickets at regular intervals to keep the opposition on their toes.Going into the final game, Pakistan have already sealed the ODI series. However, the hosts will have pride at stake as they look to pull one back. In fact, it was a slick performance put up by the visitors that helped them to romp home with seven wickets in hand in the fourth match.
