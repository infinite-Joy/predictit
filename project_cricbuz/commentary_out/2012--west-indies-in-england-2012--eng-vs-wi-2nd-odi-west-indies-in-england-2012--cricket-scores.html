West Indies were thrashed in the first ODI and they will be raring to come back against the hosts. Stay tuned for the toss and pitch report.Preview by PradeepWest Indies turned a new leaf as far as the team for the shorter formats of the game was concerned. They had their barrage of players returning from the jamboree called IPL with many of them turning out to be stars for their respective franchises. On the other hand, England were thought to be considerably weakened after the retirement of Kevin Pietersen. The shorter format of the game was expected to be West Indies' best chance of breaking the duck on this tour. Instead, all that one saw was a fairly limp performance from the men from the Caribbean Islands as the hosts romped home in comfortable fashion at Southampton. The two teams move now to London where Kia Oval will host what should be the decider for either teams.England: The hosts have few things to worry about going into the Oval. The batting fired as an unit at Aeges Bowl and the bowlers gave a demonstration on how to defend a target. Ian Bell was talked about as the likely replacement for the retired Kevin Pietersen by coach Andy Flower and he proved his credentials with an innings that resembled the solidity that has been accustomed to Bell and the aggression of Pietersen. The other batsmen played around Bell to bolster England to a formidable score.The bowling unit has been a revelation. The all round abilities of Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann has allowed room for five specialist bowling options. With no problems on the injury front, England should be able to produce more of the sort of cricket that one witnessed at Southampton.West Indies: Notwithstanding the absence of Gayle, the tourists would have been very disappointed over the standard of their cricket at Southampton. The bowling was shoddy, the fielding was not up to standards and batsmen upon batsmen played shots that would have embarrassed the team management. They would need a huge change of character if they are to come out competing against what looks like a well oiled England team. Dwayne Smith was the surprise opening choice in Gayle's absence and he did make the most with a cracking half century. The unfortunate injury of Darren Bravo meant thatthe entire batting order went topsy turvy. Bravo did come in to bat at No. 9 but the fate of the match was settled by then. On a pitch which promises a lot of runs, they will hope for better tidings at the Oval.Injury news: There has been bitter sweet news for the visitors. Gayle has been declared fit and should be available for the second ODI while Darren Bravo, who suffered a groin injury, will be flying back home. The status on Andre Russell, who had a nasty fall during the first ODI, is unclear. The team management will await their reports before taking a final decision.Quotes: It means that, whenever I throw the ball to someone, he is a world-class bowler - Alastair Cook is delighted with the bowling options at his disposal.Looking back to 2007, we came over and lost the first ODI at Lords very badly but we came back and won the series 2-1 - Darren Sammy draws inspiration from the 2007 ODI series.Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Jonathan Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Tim Bresnan, Graeme Swann, James Anderson, Steven Finn, Ravi Bopara, Jade Dernbach, Craig Kieswetter(w), Eoin Morgan, Samit Patel, Chris WoakesWest Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Fidel Edwards, Denesh Ramdin(w), Ravi Rampaul, Marlon Samuels, Tino Best, Sunil Narine, Dwayne Bravo, Johnson Charles, Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Lendl Simmons, Dwayne SmithLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
