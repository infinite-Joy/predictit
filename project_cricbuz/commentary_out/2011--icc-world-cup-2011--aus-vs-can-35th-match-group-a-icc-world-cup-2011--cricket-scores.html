AUSTRALIA:14.6  Cheema to Watson, 1 run, gets forward and pushes it to long on to retain strike
AUSTRALIA:14.5  Cheema to Watson, FOUR!!, John Davison is looking and showing that he is touching 40 years, more than that, his running after the ball to stop the boundary was the most comical part, he ran like how Mahesh Babu - the Telugu actor ran in the mega-hit movie Pokiri, never looked like anywhere close to getting near the ball, and as the ball crosses the ropes at deep mid wicket, he has a chuckle to himself, a front-pull too from Watson and he did not time it all, it went ever so slowly

AUSTRALIA:11.6 Rao to Watson, FOUR!!, Rao is not happy with the youngest player in the competition for letting it go, Nitish Kumar seemed to suggest that he had lost it in the lights, but as Simon Doull on air says the lights here are very good and high too, it was pulled to his right at deep mid and as the ball went to him at a catchable height, he pulled his hands out of the ball's way, Rao isn't impressed at all, that was definitely catchable

AUSTRALIA:11.1  Rao to Watson, 1 run, a slip in place as a short delivery is pulled to deep mid wicketBalaji Rao, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackBagai has not taken the bowling PP, the third ump clarifies. Balaji Rao who was in the probables list of the Indian team for that iconic 2001 test series against Australia comes on. He was not selected as a host of spinners played during that 3 match series. Ian Chappell compared him to Arjuna Ranatunga when he was batting - for the similarities in the way they take a single.

AUSTRALIA:10.5  Osinde to Watson, no run, Watson looks to repeat the does and the bat face closes on impact, the ball rolls to mid on

AUSTRALIA:10.1  Osinde to Haddin, 1 run, a quick single taken to the right of mid on as it is tapped wide of that fielderHas Bagai forgotten to take the bowling PP? Seems like it. He has not informed Bowden and there are still 7 men inside the circle
AUSTRALIA:9.6  Baidwan to Watson, no run, A MAIDEN OVER!! as Watson lands one on a good length on off stump, tucking up Watson who pushes it back to mid off, good stuff from Baidwan this
AUSTRALIA:9.5  Baidwan to Watson, no run, mistimed front-pull to mid on, it came quicker than Watson expected
AUSTRALIA:9.4  Baidwan to Watson, no run, that one hit the splice off the bat, it stopped on Watson who was looking to come on the front-foot, he checked his shot and the ball landed well in front of short cover

AUSTRALIA:8.4  Osinde to Watson, 1 run, nudges it to square leg, takes a single
AUSTRALIA:8.3  Osinde to Watson, no run, a huge inside edge onto the pads as Watson tried to flick a leg stumpish ball, after not taking the review last over when it was clearly out, Bagai and Osinde take it and lose it too, what a waste of a review, Bowden should not have allowed it too, but he got carried away and allowed it even after the time limit had elapsedReview time: Confusion, chaos reigning supreme at the Chinnaswamy. Osinde and Bagai took an age to go for the review. Finally the original decision stands. There is a time limit to take the review. 15 seconds that is. And the third ump informed Bowden that it was 15 seconds. After that was up, some 4-5 seconds later Bagai took the review. And strangely Bowden allowed the review.
AUSTRALIA:8.2  Osinde to Watson, no run, short of length delivery outside off and rising too, Watson hops back and defends it
AUSTRALIA:8.1  Osinde to Watson, 2 runs, good running from Watson, he nudges it off the hips to fine leg and by the time the throw came in, Watson was in and he had to hare across for it too
AUSTRALIA:7.6  Baidwan to Haddin, no run, Oh! After a lengthy discussion between Baidwan and Bagai, they have decided not to review that, I find that strange, Canada only have a couple of reviews left, it would have been well worth the risk to take it, now the replays show that it was hitting the top of the stumps too, Haddin swung across the line to a straightish ball and missed, Baidwan immediately wanted the review, Bagai was not so convinced, in the end they don't take it, Saheba gave it not-out, the original decision would've been over-turned! Poor stuff from Canada!
AUSTRALIA:7.5  Baidwan to Haddin, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, punched off the backfoot to cover, straight to the fielder
AUSTRALIA:7.4  Baidwan to Haddin, no run, Haddin is raring to go after the bowlers, he is shuffling across too much, this time he moves outside leg and gets an inside edge onto the pads as he attempts a heave
AUSTRALIA:7.3  Baidwan to Watson, 1 run, nudged into the vacant spaces near mid wicket
AUSTRALIA:7.2  Baidwan to Watson, FOUR!!, that is just a punch, a mere full face of the bat and the ball was in the air, well wide of mid on, the ball speeds away to the fence
AUSTRALIA:7.1  Baidwan to Watson, no run, good length on the middle and leg, Watson tucks it to mid wicket
AUSTRALIA:6.6  Osinde to Haddin, no run, punched off the backfoot to backward point
AUSTRALIA:6.5  Osinde to Haddin, no run, Oh! The Ugandan born Osinde is so unlucky! He could have had both the openers in this opening spell of his, but he has had only misfortune, the bottom edged pull, hits the foot-marks and then gently loops over the stumps, Haddin was into the pull too early and nearly paid the price
AUSTRALIA:6.4  Osinde to Haddin, FOUR!!, Haddin was trying to do the same thing all night and he finally manages to get one away to the fence, it was right up in the slot too, full and on middle, Haddin makes room and carves that over cover, a couple of bounces and over the ropes
AUSTRALIA:6.3  Osinde to Haddin, no run, that one kept a tad low on off stump, Haddin crouches low to defend
AUSTRALIA:6.2  Osinde to Watson, 1 run, Watson had to hare to make it back to the other end, it was tapped to the left of mid wicket, he was taking it easy, then saw that a left-hander was swooping on the ball, he makes it even as the throw misses
AUSTRALIA:6.1  Osinde to Watson, no run, full and a hit of away movement, Watson bends his leg to drive to mid off
AUSTRALIA:5.6  Baidwan to Haddin, no run, Haddin is trying to hit them too hard, he is a sweet timer of the ball when he is playing well, today, he once again mistimes the punch to cover
AUSTRALIA:5.5  Baidwan to Watson, 1 run, worked wide of short mid for an easy single
AUSTRALIA:5.4  Baidwan to Watson, FOUR!!, when I saw that initially, it looked like an edge, but as Mark Nicholas on air was saying it was deliberately played by Watson, short and wide, Watson took it from the keeper's gloves and late cut it hard into the third man fence, he plays those shots off the front-foot and gets fine rewards for it, there is almost a 4th slip placed for him and Watson knew what he was doing
AUSTRALIA:5.3  Baidwan to Watson, no run, 'yes Singhy' shouts his skipper from behind the stumps as Baidwan lands one on splice jarring length and it hits the higher part of Watson's bat
AUSTRALIA:5.2  Baidwan to Watson, no run, length ball outside off, driven with no timing to cover
AUSTRALIA:5.1  Baidwan to Watson, no run, good length delivery on off stump, Watson bends his front knee - the left one that is to defend to off
AUSTRALIA:4.6  Osinde to Haddin, FOUR!!, all 6 balls in this over have been right on the money, superb stuff from Osinde, but he has to give away a boundary since there is no second slip, it pitched on off and with the tiny away movement, squared up Haddin and took the outer edge, if there was a second slip, he would have gobbled it up, instead it runs away to the fence and leaves Osinde disappointed
AUSTRALIA:4.5  Osinde to Haddin, no run, Osinde bangs it in hard into the pitch, it is moving away from Haddin who goes back to steer it to backward point
AUSTRALIA:4.4  Osinde to Haddin, no run, Osinde is bowling really well, tight back of a length delivery on off stump, Haddin gets right behind the line to block
AUSTRALIA:4.3  Osinde to Haddin, no run, short of length delivery and into the ribs, Haddin stands tall and dead bats it down the pitch
AUSTRALIA:4.2  Osinde to Haddin, no run, back of a length and it is outside off, Haddin can't force it away as he would've liked, rolls to cover
AUSTRALIA:4.1  Osinde to Haddin, no run, short of length and angling away outside off, Haddin pushes it to the cover man

AUSTRALIA:3.5  Baidwan to Haddin, no run, punched off the backfoot to cover, straight to the fielder
AUSTRALIA:3.4  Baidwan to Haddin, FOUR!!, slashed away past the lone slip, it was full and wide outside off, Haddin threw everything at it and the ball went down to the third man fence
AUSTRALIA:3.3  Baidwan to Haddin, no run, Bagai is standing up now to prevent Haddin from dancing down the wicket, Baidwan bowls a fine in-ducker that hits Haddin on the mid-riff, the ball rolls near his feet
AUSTRALIA:3.2  Baidwan to Haddin, no run, another mistimed pull, straight to the fielder at mid on - which is Cheema again
AUSTRALIA:3.1  Baidwan to Haddin, FOUR!!, Cheema is having a night-marish night, it was pulled to his right, and the timing is not great on that either, he gives chase and tries to pull it back with a slide, but he was in contact with the ropes when the ball was in his hand, poor effort from Cheema, that was just a couple at the max
AUSTRALIA:2.6  Osinde to Watson, no run, pitched up and moving away outside off, Watson gets forward and shoulders arms
AUSTRALIA:2.5  Osinde to Haddin, 1 run, Haddin ends up in a tangle and bottom edges the pull, the ball rolls wide of short mid wicket
AUSTRALIA:2.4  Osinde to Haddin, no run, Osinde does well to tuck up Haddin who was advancing down the wicket, in the end the ball thuds into Haddin's thigh pad
AUSTRALIA:2.3  Osinde to Haddin, FOUR!!, that's all timing from Haddin, advances down the wicket, then stays beside the line to steer it past a diving backward point, the man dived, but could not get a hand on it, superbly timed and placed by Haddin
AUSTRALIA:2.2  Osinde to Haddin, no run, short of length delivery on off and middle, attacking the stumps, Haddin defends compactly from the crease
AUSTRALIA:2.1  Osinde to Haddin, no run, full ball on off stump, Haddin gets forward and drives it to cover, straight to the fielder
AUSTRALIA:1.6  Baidwan to Watson, no run, close, again Watson has a nervy moment as the cover drive, takes the inside edge and rolls past his leg stump
AUSTRALIA:1.5  Baidwan to Watson, 2 runs, catch dropped!!, Cheema never looked liked catching that at mid on, Watson top edged the pull and it went miles up in the sky, Cheema moving back from mid on, got into an awkward tangle and as the ball came down he got both hands to it, and then went to ground, a let-off for Watson
AUSTRALIA:1.4  Baidwan to Watson, no run, back of a length delivery on middle, Watson gets right behind the line and then defends
AUSTRALIA:1.3  Baidwan to Haddin, 1 run, Haddin advances down the wicket and then steers the rising delivery outside off to third man

AUSTRALIA:0.6  Osinde to Haddin, no run, another corker of a delivery, this time banged in hard and into the pitch, Haddin is expecting the fuller length delivery and half leaves/half pokes at it, the ball flies through to the keeper, magnificent first over from Osinde
AUSTRALIA:0.5  Osinde to Haddin, no run, beautiful bowling from Osinde, full and drawing Haddin into the cover drive, it pitched outside off and Haddin was beaten by the swing as it moved away past the flashing blade of Haddin
AUSTRALIA:0.4  Osinde to Watson, 1 run, driven wide of mid off and a quick single is taken, Watson is off the mark with a fine single
AUSTRALIA:0.3  Osinde to Watson, no run, short delivery and rising outside off, Watson drops everything in the way and then lets it go
AUSTRALIA:0.2  Osinde to Watson, no run, back of a length outside off, Watson shoulders arms after seeing it well
AUSTRALIA:0.1  Osinde to Watson, no run, a ripper to start too from Osinde, short of length and with a bit of bounce, Watson is surprised by the bounce, is drawn into the forward defensive, the ball kicks off the deck and as Watson pushes at it, it leaves him, a real brute, so close to the edgeWatson and Haddin are at the crease. Watson is on strike. Osinde will open the attackA wonderful evening and a perfect sunset here in Bengaluru. The Aussie openers are out and we are all set to go. Do the Canadians have one last gasp effort in them to at least stretch the mighty Aussies? I highly doubt it. The Canadian side are in a huddle and and a couple of them are sporting a smile. Right, it is Srivathsa along with Realtime Thiru - who is on scoring, who will be bringing you the first 15 overs.Henry Osinde - who is being compared to the West Indian tear-away quickie of the seventies - Sylvester Clarke - for their bustling run-up and their similarities in their bowling run-ups. A couple of slips for him too.Tait: They started off really well and we did well to drag it back. I was a bit rusty early on, but when the ball started to reverse I came back strongly. The conditions in India are such that we have to bowl straight. Yeah, good figures in the end for Brett. We are peaking at the right time, we have had a couple of good practice sessions before this game. We are looking forward to the game against Pakistan. The hotels have been very good here at India and I'm enjoying my stay.Hansra disappointed too and Tait came back to pick up Surkari after knocking the wind out of him - by hitting him in the box. The last 15 overs of the Canadian innings was a crawl as Australia used their spinners to rush through their overs - as they were well behind the over-rate. Bagai looked good till he played a poor shot to get out and from then, their innings went into free-fall. It looks like an easy chase for the Aussies, but cricket has a funny way of biting back. We will be back shortly for the chase.Canada started off like a run-away train and then came to a grinding halt like a slow goods passenger. Hiral Patel, whom Sunil Gavaskar compared to Parthiv for their similarity in looks - played a blinder. Patel came out and played with no fear, belting Lee and Tait all over the park. A back-foot carve over deep point that went all the way was the shot of the tournament - according to Mark Nicholas. But he played one shot too many and got out. 4
CANADA:45.4  Lee to Whatham, out Bowled!! Lee cleans him up with a high full toss, it was angled in, Whatham was backing up looking to hit that over the infield, he misses and the leg stump has been uprooted.

CANADA:45.3  Lee to Whatham, no run, back of a length and Whatham goes back to defend it
CANADA:45.2  Lee to Osinde, 1 run, well Ponting has been grumpy all day and this won't help his cause, please get all the LCD TVs out of the dressing room, it was slapped to Clarke at cover and they decided to take a single, the throw came firing in to the bowler's end, Ponting was backing up, he drops the ball before whipping the bailsA run out chance, third umpire called for!The time is 6:00 PM local time, which is the scheduled close of the first innings, the Aussies have been very slow!

CANADA:43.5  Lee to Rao, no run, Rao chips a slower one towards short cover, landed just short of him, Ponting is not looking all that happy
CANADA:43.4  Lee to Rao, no run, fuller and angled in, Rao swings his bat at it, had that connected, by assuming the power of the big man, it might have as well landed outside the stadium, such a powerful swing but only meets thin air
CANADA:43.3  Lee to Rao, no run, short of a good length stuff angled in from wide of the crease, Rao was looking to steer it wide of the man at slip, he makes no contact yet again

CANADA:41.2  Krejza to Baidwan, out Caught by Ponting at mid off!! Well, that's the end of a little cameo from Baidwan, he came down the track and looked to sky that over deep mid wicket, was into the shot early, it was more of a leading edge, the ball went high up in the air, took ages to come down, Ponting at mid off and Steven Smith at mid on were after the ball, Ponting called 'Mine Mine' but Smith collides with Ponting after Ponting took the catch with his fingers pointing up. Ponting loses his cool, shows his emotions by throwing the ball hard on the ground, that's not what a captain should do on the field. Baidwan c Ponting b Krejza 17(14) [4s-3] Krejza to Baidwan, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
CANADA:41.1  Krejza to Baidwan, FOUR!!, that's poor bowling, too short, Baidwan swats it with flat bat, up and over extra cover, gets a boundaryI guess it's time they decide about the batting powerplay, there is not much batting to come after these two and also, the spinners are operating.

CANADA:40.1  Steven Smith to Whatham, no run, well tossed up, played back to the bowler off the frontfootSteven Smith, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackThe over rate has been horrible from the Aussies, they have 20 minutes left and they are ten overs behind. Ponting is getting the spinners to bowl looking to get some quick overs. But, isn't it better to get his quickies and rattle the tail?

CANADA:36.3  Johnson to Nitish Kumar, out Caught by Tait at mid off!!

CANADA:31.3  Lee to Cheema, out Bowled!! Canada are falling apart here, Cheema has been foxed by a slower delivery on the middle stump, good length delivery on the stumps, Cheema gave himself room as he looks to drive it, the slowness of the delivery beats him completely, he is too early into the stroke and sees his middle peg knocked out of the ground, a poor shot under the circumstances by Cheema.

With that, I, Sid V, will take a breather and it will be Pradeep to take you through.
CANADA:29.6  Krejza to Hansra, out Caught by Lee at long on!! That is a bad shot from Hansra! Krejza stays over the wicket, lands a loopy delivery outside off, spins into Hansra, he gets down on one knee and looks to thump it over widish long on, but the bat face closed when he hit that, does not get the desired elevation, Lee runs forward, slides and takes an easy catch, Canada are stuttering a bit here.

Patel is on strike. Tait will open the attackTime for the Anthems, we have listened to them for quite a few times now, the Canadian Anthem precedes the Aussie National Anthem. The Aussie supporters who have turned up at Bengaluru hold their national flag and sing the anthem with pride filled in their faces. Alright, as the anthems get over, it's time for business. This is Ajith, and I will be with you until the first drinks break.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, Michael Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Jason Krejza, Brett Lee, Shaun TaitCanada (Playing XI): Hiral Patel, John Davison, Zubin Surkari, Ashish Bagai(w/c), Jimmy Hansra, Rizwan Cheema, Nitish Kumar, Karl Whatham, Harvir Baidwan, Balaji Rao, Henry OsindeCanada have won the toss and elected to batPonting: Yeah Mr. Cricket has joined the squad and he played well in the previous game, good for us. We are going in with the same team.Bagai: We would like to bat first, the wicket looks a bit dry but I guess batting will be easier. This is our last game, and we are ready for it.Pitch report: The wicket has a drier look to it compared to the last few games, otherwise it is a very good track, there won't be much for the spinners. This is a kind of pitch that would stay good for 7-8 hours. Batting first will be easy, and Canada must look to do that feels Ravi Shastri.Hello folks! It's time for Australia to take on Canada at the Garden city, Bengaluru. Not many would put their money on Canada to cause an upset, and Australia's winning streak is not under any serious threat. It will be Davison's last game, an emotional moment for him and his teammates. Will Canada win the toss? Will Australia opt to bat first or will they bowl and look to finish the game as early as possible? This is Ajith, I will bring you all the action along with Pradeep, Sid V and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be right back.Preview by Gokul GopalWith the four quarter-finalists already decided from Group A, Australia's aim, as they take on Canada, would be only to register a facile win against the North-American team and storm to the top of the table.Head to Head: Both sides have faced off against each other only once. Their previous encounter was way back in 1979 World Cup, when Australia completed a comfortable 7-wicket win on June 16th in Birmingham.Team News:
Australia: Australia's unbeaten run in the World Cup was only slightly halted by the rain-marred game against Sri Lanka, which was eventually abandoned with both teams sharing a point each. But their winning run has continued since that, and they are the only team in the World Cup to have not lost a single game yet. However, it must be said that Australia, despite registering 3 wins in their 4 games, have looked rusty, particularly the spin department. While Brett Lee and Shaun Tait have kept the heat on with tremendous spells of bowling at the start, the spinners have not been able to take the momentum forward. Jason Krejza and Steve Smith have taken only three wickets between them so far despite the spin-friendly sub-continental tracks. The Kenyans made a spirited chase of Australia's 324-6, by putting up a gallant 264/6 and batting out the entire 50 overs. Smith and Krejza along with Michael Clarke, combined 19 wicketless overs in this match, which cost 93 runs. Ponting would be hoping that the spinners come good in the match against Canada and regain the much-needed confidence as the business end of the tournament is fast approaching.
While, Michael Hussey dream return to the Australia's scheme of things with a composed half-century, and Michael Clarke's return to form with his 93, are welcome signs for the Australian team, it has to be mentioned that lack of match practice between the Sri Lanka game and the one against Kenya, has led to rustiness for a few batsmen, as admitted by the skipper Ricky Ponting. The form of the Aussie captain and Cameron White has been patchy and the would look at the game against Canada as the ideal platform to hit form ahead of the important match against Pakistan.Canada: The North American team's progress has been slightly better in the latter stages of the first round after a woeful start to their World Cup campaign. Following a thumping at the hands of Sri Lanka in the first game, it was a meek surrender to Zimbabwe in Canada's second match. It was only in their third match that the Canadians made their presence felt in the tournament. They gave Pakistan a scare by bowling them out for 184, and looked on course towards the target before falling off the track. The Canadian middle order, which was to blame for the string of poor performances, finally came good when skipper Ashish Bagai and Jimmy Hansra scored half-centuries to power Canada's win against Kenya. Despite a loss in their next game against New Zealand, chasing a mammoth 359, the same pair of Bagai and Hansra ensured that they they did not surrender without a fight. The Canadian skipper missed out on a well-deserved hundred, falling on 84 while Hansrs scored an unbeaten 70 as the North American team played out the entire quota of overs.
In the game against Australia, which would be the North American team's final game of the 2011 World Cup, Canada would be desperately hoping for the openers to contribute to the team's cause and rely on the bowlers to deliver some key strikes. However, it is easier said than done because it will not be a walk in the park for them, going up against the might of the reigning World Cup champions.Quotes:A few of us were rusty and needed some time in the middle, as you would expect after 16 days with not much cricket. There was a bit of experimentation from the spinners but having said that I still would have liked to see them make some breakthroughs for us: Ricky Ponting, referring to the rustiness of the spinners and a few batsmen including himself.
It's pretty fitting that it is against Australia. I've lived all my life there. I was never quite good enough to get a game for them. It will be a great experience to play against them. There's some guys in the team who I've had a fair bit to do with, playing against or coaching. So it would be nice to have a good showing against them: John Davison, having announced his retirement, hopes for a fitting end.Teams:Australia (From): Shane Watson, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting(c), Michael Clarke, Cameron White, Michael Hussey, Steven Smith, Mitchell Johnson, Brett Lee, Jason Krejza, Shaun Tait, John Hastings, David Hussey, Tim Paine, Callum FergusonCanada (From): Hiral Patel, John Davison, Zubin Surkari, Ashish Bagai(w/c), Jimmy Hansra, Rizwan Cheema, Ruvindu Gunasekera, Harvir Baidwan, Khurram Chohan, Henry Osinde, Balaji Rao, Parth Desai, Tyson Gordon, Nitish Kumar, Karl Whatham, Hamza TariqLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
