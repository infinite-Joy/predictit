Shafiul to open the attack.Simmons and Barath are at the crease. Simmons is on strike. Shafiul Islam will open the attackPitch report: It is a hot and humid day but there is some breeze. The wicket is dry and has some cracks on it. The ball will come on to the bat nicely when the quicks are bowling but the slower bowlers will be effective too. It should remain the same throughout the game and will be a good wicket for an one day game.Ramdin: We would have bowled first as well. Sammy has a stomach problem and hopefully he will be back for the next game.Rahim: There may be some dew so we will bowl. Our 50 overs cricket needs a lift. Hopefully the boys are up to it and will deliver today.Teams:Bangladesh (Playing XI): Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Mohammad Ashraful, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w/c), Alok Kapali, Naeem Islam, Nasir Hossain, Abdur Razzak, Shafiul Islam, Rubel HossainWest Indies (Playing XI): Lendl Simmons, Adrian Barath, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Danza Hyatt, Denesh Ramdin(w/c), Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Devendra Bishoo, Ravi Rampaul, Kemar RoachDarren Sammy misses out for West Indies with an upset stomach. Pollard, Roach and Bishoo come in to the eleven. Martin and Brathwaite are the others to miss out along with Sammy. Ramdin will be the captain. Bangladesh remain unchanged.Bangladesh have won the toss and elected to fieldHello and welcome to the coverage of the first ODI between Bangladesh and West Indies. Bangladesh will be on a high after their thrilling win in the lone T20 game, but this is a completely different format. This will be the first ODI game to be played under the new ICC regulations, so it will be interesting to see how the teams adjust. Stay tuned for further updates..Preview by Ganesh CThe previous time these two sides met in an ODI in Bangladesh was in the World Cup earlier this year. Then, Bangladesh started off as favourites especially since it was played at home. Bangladesh had had an impressive run at home against the Kiwis just before the World Cup. The crowd was waiting in eager anticipation too but the West Indians spoiled their party then. Bangladesh failed to cope up with the intense pressure then and folded up for a paltry 58.West Indies chased it down with ease but the reaction after their emphatic win was something very sour. The team bus was stoned as it was returning back from the stadium by angry Bangladeshi fans. The home crowd has always been very encouraging despite the lacklustre performances in the past but the series win against New Zealand has increased the expectations by multifolds. Handling these expectations is going to be one of the biggest challenges for Rahim and Stuart Law, the new coach.Bangladesh:Bangladesh have got off to a very good start with a new combination leading them. Mushfiqur Rahim accepted the responsibility given to him in a gamely manner with a superb knock in the only T20 game. The spunky keeper has impressed before with the bat and behind the wickets before but it is just the start of what should be a long term as the captain of the Bangladeshi side and he has an ideal opportunity to step up their performances against West Indies. Their opposition is a team that is one that is in the bottom half of the ICC ODI rankings. The home advantage is something that Bangladesh will look to capitalise on. Their strategy of playing three spinners has worked with decent success before and they will look to improve upon the same.West Indies:The absence of Chris Gayle is something that West Indies are yet come to terms with. The powerful opener was the most influential figure in the team while he was there and WI are finding it difficult to replace the mercurial Jamaican. Adrian Barath and Lendl Simmons have been steady at the start but neither has been able to make their starts count on quite a few occasions. This series presents them with another opportunity to correct their shortcomings. The middle order is still an inexperienced one and they will face quite a stern test against the Bangla spinners. Marlon Samuels will look to pull his weight and take up the responsibility as the senior man in the middle order. The bowling bears a much better look. Ravi Rampaul has been a tireless performer and has managed to provide them the early strikes. The emergence of Devendra Bishoo gives Sammy an attacking option in the middle overs. Darren Sammy himself has shown remarkable composure under severe criticism but will look to enhance his reputation as a player alone to silence his doubters.Quotes:It was good to see the way Marlon performed. He is playing very well at the moment and is doing his bit with the bat and ball - Darren SammyToday we played well in all three departments, and we look forward to doing that in the one-dayers as well - Mushfiqur Rahim after the T20 win.
