SRI LANKA:24.5 24.5Charles to A Mendis, SIX, in the airrrrrr and that's gone all the way. Ajantha Mendis, you beauty! What a knock under pressure. Can't bowl length balls at this stage Charles, Mendis goes deep in the crease and across the stumps as well, throws everything at it and slogs really hard, the ball went high up in the air and cleared the long-on boundaryFree-hit coming up
SRI LANKA:24.5 Charles to A Mendis, no ball, 2 runs, dropped, but it won't count. First he bowled a wide and now he's overstepped the line. Slower delivery on the stumps, Mendis slogs, deep mid-wicket runs forward, dives and gets both hands to it, but it doesn't stick it
SRI LANKA:24.4 Charles to A Mendis, no run, slower delivery on the stumps, Mendis goes for an almighty slog, gets an under edge that rolls into the on-side

SRI LANKA:23.4 J Carter to Malinga, out Lbw!! What a turnaround this is! Carter is on a hat-trick now. Nothing but a good length delivery from Carter, Malinga missed the line completely, in fact he played outside the line as he tried to defend. The ball hit him in line with leg and it was crashing into the leg stump according to Hawk-Eye. The umpire immediately raised his finger, but Malinga reviewed, only for the on-field call to be proven right. Malinga lbw b J Carter 0(1)J Carter to Malinga, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!That should be out LBW and it's given. Malinga reviews after a thought. Surely, only an edge can save him. Looked pretty straightforward. Malinga took a while to review, so that's a sign that he didn't edge it. It has clearly missed the bat. Hawk-Eye confirms that the ball would crash into the leg stump and the on-field decision is upheld.So then, 11 runs needed with 2 wickets in hand.Lasith Malinga, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:23.3 J Carter to Senanayake, out Bowled!! That's gone through the gate. This is great bowling from Carter. Maiden ODI wicket for him. He shaped the previous one away from the right-hander and then shapes this back into him. Senanayake completely foxed. He was lazy in his attempted push down the ground and the ball took the inside edge before crashing into the middle stump. Captain Jason Holder is elated. Senanayake b J Carter 7(13) [4s-1]J Carter to Senanayake, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!

SRI LANKA:23.1 J Carter to Senanayake, FOUR, remember, this lad can bat. He's no mug with the bat. Full and in the slot, Senanayake doesn't try to over-hit the ball, just lofts it back over the bowler's head and it runs away for four
SRI LANKA:23.1 J Carter to Senanayake, wide, pacy bumper, Senanayake ducks under it, but the umpire doesn't like the height on that one. That was well above head heightHolder ends, 5-1-29-0. Narine, Holder and Carter have a chat and it's going to be Carter with the ball.
SRI LANKA:22.6 Holder to A Mendis, no run, beaten. Short of a length delivery on the off stump, Mendis backs away and thinks about the cut, decides against it at the last moment and the ball flies past the edge. A maiden over from Holder
SRI LANKA:22.5 Holder to A Mendis, no run, very full and on the leg stump, Mendis flicks it to mid-wicket. It's 5 dots in a row, but Sri Lanka won't mind

SRI LANKA:21.2 J Carter to A Mendis, 2 runs, that's driven nicely off the front foot, that gets the crowd dancing in the stands, this was a good shot off the front foot, but the slow outfield denies him a boundary. It was full and outside off stump, Mendis square-drove it nicely past pointSri Lanka need 21 runs off 29 balls.
SRI LANKA:21.1 J Carter to A Mendis, 2 runs, my word! He's playing some brave shots and this is looked very good indeed. The crowd are up on their feet cheering Mendis.

SRI LANKA:20.3 Narine to A Mendis, FOUR, top shot, big roar from the crowd, four crucial runs. Shortish and outside off stump, Mendis goes on the back foot and also makes room, cuts it away past point and it runs away for four
SRI LANKA:20.2 Narine to A Mendis, no run, beaten! Flighted delivery outside off stump, Mendis looks to defend, but the ball beats the edge
SRI LANKA:20.1 Narine to A Mendis, no run, what was Mendis doing? Firstly, it was an outrageous slog-sweep attempted, the ball rolled to the right of mid-wicket, then Mendis takes off blindly for a run, but his partner doesn't respond, the throw comes to the keeper and just before Ramdin whipped the bails off, Mendis made his way back to the crease. The third umpire had long look at it and was convinced that the bails weren't dislodged when Mendis' bat was on the lineRun-out check has been sent upstairs. Mendis is the man in question. Did the dive save him? Oh yes, just in!The equation now is 28 runs needed off 36 balls. Can Sri Lanka hold the nerve? Narine to bowl out.

SRI LANKA:18.6 Narine to Gunathilaka, out Bowled!! I told you Narine is a handy bowler to have when bowling to the lower-order. Sri Lanka's inexperience is hurting them badly. Once again the quicker delivery from Narine, Gunathilaka plays inside the line as he tries to defend, misses and the ball hits the off stump.

SRI LANKA:0.2 Jerome Taylor to K Perera, FOUR, that's just a punch down the ground, he jammed the bat hurriedly as this full ball swung back very late, mid-on was very square and even though it went uppishly, the ball safely escaped for fourA lone slip in place

WEST INDIES:21.2 Mathews to A Russell, out Caught by Gunathilaka!! I would have to say that this is a lucky wicket for Sri Lanka and Mathews. Normally, a full ball right in the slot would be deposited deep into the stands by Russell, but he's mistimed this loft completely. Long-off settles under it and takes a comfortable catch. A Russell c Gunathilaka b Mathews 41(24) [4s-3 6s-3]Mathews to A Russell, THAT'S OUT!!

WEST INDIES:4.5 Malinga to Darren Bravo, FOUR, cracking shot, long half-volley from Malinga, full and wide outside off, Bravo leans forward, presents the full face of the bat and caresses it wide of extra cover for a boundary
WEST INDIES:4.4 Malinga to Darren Bravo, no run, loud shout for LBW, but the angle was taking the ball down the leg-side. This was the inswinging yorker from Malinga, Bravo looks to flick and misses, gets struck on the pads, but the ball was sliding down
WEST INDIES:4.3 Malinga to Darren Bravo, no run, short of a length and well outside off, Bravo gets on top of the bounce and steers it straight to the fielder at backward point

WEST INDIES:3.4 Lakmal to Samuels, no run, short of length delivery wide outside off stump, left aloneMarlon Samuels, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:3.3 Lakmal to Andre Fletcher, out Caught by Dilshan!! This is poor, seriously poor cricket from Fletcher. That's catching practice and Dilshan has a very good pair of hands. Lakmal has two wickets in 9 balls now. Harmless short of length delivery outside off stump, lot of width on offer, Fletcher drives off the back foot and finds backward point to perfection. Both the openers are back in the hut. Andre Fletcher c Dilshan b Lakmal 3(15)Lakmal to Andre Fletcher, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
WEST INDIES:3.2 Lakmal to Andre Fletcher, no run, beaten! Lovely delivery from Lakmal. Slightly scrambled seam and on a good length, the ball nips away off the deck and opens up Fletcher as he tries to defend and it just missed the edge
WEST INDIES:3.1 Lakmal to Darren Bravo, 1 run, back of a length and on the leg stump, Bravo tucks it off the back foot to long leg

WEST INDIES:2.2 Malinga to Darren Bravo, 1 run, Malinga tries the yorker, but bowls a low full toss, driven gently to mid-off
WEST INDIES:2.1 Malinga to Darren Bravo, no run, huge shout for LBW, Malinga looks very confident and wants the captain to review it. To me thought it looked as if the impact was outside off stump. Anyway, let's go through the process. Legal ball as Malinga's front foot is fine. Oh dear! Looks like Sri Lanka are going to lose their only review. A bad review as the impact is well outside off. The third umpire wants to confirm if there was an edge before having a look at Hawk-Eye. You might wonder why they don't look at Hawk-Eye first in such cases, but there a process for DRS and the umpire has to first ensure that no bat was involved. No edge and Hawk-Eye says impact was way outside off stump. Sri Lanka lose their only review. Fullish delivery angled, Bravo tries to drive, missed and got hit on the front pad
WEST INDIES:2.1 Malinga to Darren Bravo, wide, oops! Malinga tries to angle one in, but bowls way down the leg-sideMalinga to come round the wicket for the left-hander

WEST INDIES:1.3 Lakmal to Charles, out Lbw!! Big shoutttt and the finger goes up. The appeal was a confident one from Lakmal and umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge took a while to make the call. Was it too high? Charles thought about the review, but then decided not to send it upstairs. Dream start for Lakmal and Sri Lanka. This good length delivery skids off the surface and thuds into Charles' pad as he fails to defend. He was beaten for pace more than anything else. The line wasn't a problem as it hit him in line with middle. The fact that it hit Charles on the back pad meant it didn't a lot of distance to travel and Hawk-Eye confirms that the ball would have crashed into the top of off stump. Charles lbw b Lakmal 1(2)Lakmal to Charles, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
WEST INDIES:1.2 Lakmal to Andre Fletcher, 1 run, length delivery on the off stump, Fletcher walks across the stumps and works it through backward square leg

Let's hope that we don't have any more delays.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Kusal Perera(w), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Danushka Gunathilaka, Angelo Mathews(c), Shehan Jayasuriya, Milinda Siriwardana, Sachithra Senanayake, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith MalingaWest Indies (Playing XI): Johnson Charles, Andre Fletcher, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Jonathan Carter, Denesh Ramdin(w), Jason Holder(c), Andre Russell, Carlos Brathwaite, Sunil Narine, Jerome TaylorHolder: "I would have probably bowled first as well. Narine is back, Carlos Brathwaite returns as well."Mathews: "We will bowl first. Ideally I would have batted first, but because of the weather we are bowling first. Good to have Malinga and Ajantha back. Anything under 250 would be good."Pitch Report: "279 is the average score batting first here. It is a good pitch. I don't think we will see a lot of sideways movement. With the rain around, chasing could be easier," reckons Russel Arnold.The floodlights have been switched on. All the covers are off. Although it is a bit of grey out there, the conditions are much better than earlier. Fingers crossed!15:31 Local Time, 10:01 GMT, 15:31 IST: The word is that no overs have been deducted. Play will begin at 15:50. The innings break has been reduced to 30 minutes.Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to field15:20 Local Time, 09:50 GMT, 15:20 IST: Looks like the toss has been pushed to 15:30. We are also hearing that it will be a 48-overs-per-side game. Still waiting for the official confirmation though.15:00 Local Time, 09:30 GMT, 15:00 IST: The drizzle has completely stopped now and the covers are coming off. Things have slightly brightened up as the sun makes an appearance. "The new time set for the start is 3
WEST INDIES:3.50  with the toss scheduled at 3.2
WEST INDIES:3.20 pm . Fingers crossed," tweets Roshan Abeysinghe.14:45 Local Time, 09:15 GMT, 14:45 IST: The drizzle has stopped and the covers are slowly coming off, but there are still a few dark clouds though. Ah! Scratch that update. Just as I finished typing the update, the rain returns. The pitch and the ground is being covered.14:30 Local Time, 09:00 GMT, 14:30 IST: drizzle rain is quite steady now and we might be in for a long delay. The groundsmen have covered the entire ground.14:10 Local Time, 08:40 GMT, 14:10 IST: Oopsy! The drizzle has returned and the covers are coming back on. The toss has been delayed further. "Bad news it's got dark and rain. The covers are coming back," is the latest tweet from Roshan Abeysinghe.14:00 Local Time, 08:30 GMT, 14:00 IST: The covers are being peeled off and the news is that if there is no more rain, the game will begin at 14:45 local time, with toss at 14:15. However, there are a few dark clouds in the background. Fingers crossed!13:55 Local Time, 08:25 GMT, 13:55 IST: Unfortunately, the weather isn't great today either. It was raining a little while ago and the covers haven't been fully removed. We are hearing that the toss will most certainly be delayed. Stay tuned for more updates.13:45 Local Time, 08:15 GMT, 13:45 IST: The visitors would be buoyed by the fact that they won the warm-up game against Sri Lanka Board President's XI a few days ago. In what was a rain-curtailed game, Andre Russell hit a breezy 89, while Carlos Brathwaite smashed his way to a 58-ball 113. However, West Indies would be worried about the fact that they were reduced to 109/7 at one stage, before Russell and Brathwaite staged a brilliant recovery.13:40 Local Time, 08:10 GMT, 13:40 IST: Sri Lanka on the other hand have played an ODI series in July, but they lost it 2-3 to Pakistan. Angelo Mathews' team is in a rebuilding phase and he would want his boys to perform to potential and quickly develop the side into a formidable unit. Sunil Narine will make a comeback to the ODI setup after tweaking his bowling action. Narine last played for West Indies in August, 2014. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Lasith Malinga too return for national duty.13:30 Local Time, 08:00 GMT, 13:30 IST: West Indies were completely outplayed in the Test series by Sri Lanka, but the men from the Caribbean are far more comfortable with white-ball cricket. However, they have not played any limited overs cricket post the 2015 World Cup, meaning they will be wearing the coloured clothing after a gap of almost 8 months. Hello and a warm welcome to the first ODI of the 3-match series. We are at the Premadasa Stadium in Colombo today to kick off the ODI series.Preview:A week after doing what has now become the norm - conceding a Test from a position of strength, West Indies return to white-ball cricket, for the first time since the World Cup, in the hope of an immediate reversal of fortunes. Even by their modest recent standards, West Indies cricket appears to have hit a new low in 2015.From the axing of a Test stalwart Shivnarine Chanderpaul to the suspension of Phil Simmons, the then head coach, the team has seen it all. The biggest setback of the year, however, was when the team failed to qualify for next year's Champions Trophy.With the 2019 World Cup said to be a ten-team event, the once mighty West Indies could miss direct qualification if they fail to make top eight of the rankings table by the cut-off date - September 30, 2017.Crucial ranking points are on offer in the three-match series against Sri Lanka and Jason Holder & Co. could ill afford a poor start. The good news for the visitors is that their limited-overs squad is infused with performers who can single-handedly turn games around, as illustrated in the warm-up game when Andre Russell and Carlos Braithwaite added a rapid 193 for the eighth wicket after West Indies were reduced to 109 for 7.Despite the absence of Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard, West Indies will be buoyed by the return of mystery spinner Sunil Narine. The Trinidadian was left out of the World Cup squad due to question marks surrounding the legality of his bowling action. Narine's return and the changes to the ODI fielding rules should come as a relief for Holder, whose side had made a habit of leaking runs at the death. Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher will be counted on to provide the blitz at the top of the order with Chris Gayle's ODI future in a cloud following a back surgery post the Caribbean Premier League.Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have problems of their own. They were propelled to the quarterfinals of the World Cup by a marauding Kumar Sangakkara, who scored four centuries, but produced a rather insipid performance in their first assignment post his retirement; one which resulted in a series loss at home to Pakistan.That prompted an influx of uncapped players - Shehan Jayasuriya, Jeffrey Vandersay and Danushka Gunathilaka - into the ODI squad for this three-match series. Tillakaratne Dilshan, now a member of Club 10,000, has the added responsibility of bringing stability to the top-order alongside the more hit-and-miss Kusal Perera. Dinesh Chandimal's good form holds the overly-reliant-on-Mathews middle-order in good stead.The bowling, however, remains a worry. The team management have been forced to go back to Ajantha Mendis and Nuwan Kulasekara for the lack of better alternatives. Sri Lanka's primary mode of attack - spin - at the Premadasa could be negated considering the amount of rainfall Colombo has received these past few days. Should the spinners be rendered ineffective, the spotlight will once again shift squarely to Lasith Malinga and the master bowler's ability to shrug off the the post-ankle surgery slump in form.The first ODI will be played at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday (November 1).Teams:West Indies (From): Johnson Charles, Andre Fletcher, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Andre Russell, Jason Holder(c), Carlos Brathwaite, Sunil Narine, Jerome Taylor, Ravi Rampaul, Jonathan Carter, Jason Mohammed, Jermaine Blackwood, Devendra BishooSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kusal Perera(w), Lahiru Thirimanne, Shehan Jayasuriya, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Milinda Siriwardana, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara, Sachithra Senanayake, Suranga Lakmal, Ajantha Mendis, Dushmantha Chameera, Danushka Gunathilaka, Jeffrey VandersayLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
