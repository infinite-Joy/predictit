T Afzal will open the attackUAE have done extremely well to bundle out Hong Kong for a paltry 157. The Hong Kong batsmen all got starts but none of them converted it into a big one. There was no application shown and some loose shots were played. The UAE bowlers were discplined and hit the right areas. Shahzad was the pick of the them as he scalped 4 wickets and was well supported by the rest. Their batters should fancy chasing down this target. Join us in a short while for the chase...4
