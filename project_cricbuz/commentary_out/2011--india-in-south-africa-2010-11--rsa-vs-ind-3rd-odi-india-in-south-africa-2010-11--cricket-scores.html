Rohit Sharma is on strike. Steyn will open the attackWelcome back, the Indian run chase is about to unfold.India will be delighted with this effort. After SA won the toss and batted first, Zaheer stepped up to the plate and troubled Graeme Smith with swing. He and Amla never looked comfortable and Zak snapped up Amla cheaply. India maintained the pressure and Harbhajan accounted for Ingram and Smith to leave the Proteas tottering at 90/4. Duminy and du Plessis steadied the innings by scoring half centuries. Their vital 110 run partnership helped SA get to a respectable total. du Plessis has staked his claim to a place in the South Africa World Cup squad with this knock. However, the batting power-play spelled trouble once again for South Africa. Another batting collapse, where they lost 6 wickets for 20 runs, has resulted in the Proteas managing only 220. It will be an interesting run chase considering the history of day-night matches at Newlands. In 20 day-night encounters, teams batting second have lost 16 times and Dhoni will be wanting to change that stat desperately today. Can India chase this target down and take a 2-1 lead in the series or will South Africa run through the Indian batting with swing? Join us in a short while for the run-chase.4

It was a tough decision batting at that time as we where three down. I and MS decided to bat sensibly and score runs steadily. The field was up and I was hoping Munaf would pitch it up. We thought Parnell would hit it in the air and luckily it came straight to me. Keeping in mind the conditions in India, we have selected a good team and we are on the right track in our preparations.Morne Morkel: The past couple of days wasn't all that special for us. We didn't do well in the last 20 overs of the game, we have learnt our lessons and we are ready to fight back. Bowling first change works for me, it is something different from what I am used to. Our main focus is to win the series, we have our preparations going on for the WC as well.Well, most of us believed that Ashwin/Chawla would get some match practice before the WC. But, Dhoni's intentions are clear, he says the first priority is to win the ODI series.Teams:India (Playing XI): Murali Vijay, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Yusuf Pathan, MS Dhoni(w/c), Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Munaf PatelSouth Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Colin Ingram, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Johan Botha, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo TsotsobeSouth Africa have won the toss and elected to batDhoni: We would have liked to bat first as well, but unfortunately, the toss didn't go our way. We need to start well with the ball. 190 odd wasn't a good score, we bowled well to come back into the game. The priority is to do well in the series. We have got Yusuf Pathan in the side, Rohit will open the innings.Smith: We would like to bat first, it is a decent wicket, it will get slower as the game progresses. Partnerships are key over here, we would like to play good cricket. It's easier said than done, we are aware of what happened at Jo'burg, we dominated for 75 overs and then lost it from there. du Plessis comes in place of Miller.Pitch report: It is always better to bowl second on this wicket, the ball will do a bit under the lights. There is a bit of grass on the wicket, but the grass is dry which may assist the spinners. Bat first and post a reasonable total feels Shaun Pollock.Munaf Patel: There will be a bit of bounce in the wicket in the South African conditions, line and length is the key with a couple of variations. Dhoni told be just before the start of the 2nd ODI that I would be given the new ball. It was a challenge, and glad that I bowled well.MS Dhoni at the press conference - 'Losing players like Sehwag, Gambhir and Tendulkar is a big blow. We haven't been able to field our best XI so far but it is a right opportunity for youngsters to prove their mettle'After a nail biting thriller at the Bullring, the two teams lock horns at Newlands, Cape town for the third ODI. With the series levelled at 1-1, none of the two teams would like their opposition to take a healthy lead in the series at this stage. It promises to be yet another enthralling contest, and with the Indian squad for the WC announced, Yusuf Pathan, Chawla/Ashwin may get a game in today. The Proteas on the other hand, would have had some time to reflect on how they let the second ODI slip out of their hands after dominating it for most parts. This is Ajith and I will take you through along with my colleagues Karthik, Pradeep and Sid V. Thiru will be on the scoring duties. Don't go away, we'll be right back with more.Preview by Sid VStunning is the only word that comes to mind when one wants to describe India's one run victory at Johannesburg. This victory has given them much needed confidence in this final series before the World Cup. For South Africa, the word 'Choke' may be coming back to haunt them. The victory at Johannesburg was India's first victory against South Africa in South Africa after 10 years and it was their fourth overall. The action now shifts to Cape Town where India would want to take a lead against a South African team with a fragile batting line-up.India arrive at a venue where they spectacularly snatched defeat from the jaws of victory five years ago. After South Africa won the toss and elected to bat, India ran through the top order and reduced them to 76/6. It all looked good until Justin Kemp ferociously took apart the Indian bowlers. He blasted seven sixes and made mincemeat of a lackluster attack to score his only ODI ton. His efforts helped South Africa reach 274/7 and India were thoroughly demoralized. They lost momentum and the match by 106 runs and from that point on, their tour went from bad to worse. Dhoni will be wanting to avoid a repeat and ensure India go all out for a win at Newlands.The pitch in Cape Town is expected to assist the spinners a little but it will assist the swing bowlers under lights. The venue has acquired a dubious distinction in day-night matches. Out of the 20 day night matches that have been played in Cape Town since 2000, teams batting second have lost 16 times. Looking at the numbers, Dhoni will want to bat first if he wins the toss. It will be interesting to see what MS does with his team composition. This ODI is been played a day after the announcement of India's final World Cup squad of 15. With injury ruling key players out for this series, Dhoni might be forced to continue his experimentation.The withdrawal of Tendulkar due to a hamstring injury has left the opener's slot vacant and Parthiv Patel might feature in this crucial match. With the exception of Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh, the middle order has looked brittle and Dhoni might be considering certain changes. Yusuf Pathan did not feature in the first two ODIs and he might be considered for selection. Rohit Sharma and Murali Vijay will want to end the tour on a high following their exclusion from the World Cup. However, the big worry remains Suresh Raina. He has failed on this tour and his batting look to be all over the place. Raina will be hoping to turn the corner in this game.With reports of Zaheer Khan carrying a slight niggle, Dhoni will be in two minds whether to rest him for the series or continue playing him. Ashish Nehra has not been in good form in this series. He has struggled to maintain consistency in his line and length and South Africa have duly punished him. Munaf Patel has been the star so far with a match winning 4/29 in the previous ODI. His McGrathesque line and length has troubled the South Africans and he will be the key man in the bowling department. Dhoni has had to bank on the part-timers like Raina, Rohit Sharma and Yuvraj Singh to bail the team out of trouble. Harbhajan has looked steady but hardly threatening. Depending upon the surface at Newlands, the Indian skipper may want to tweak the bowling line-up a bit. With the pitch probably assisting spin, Ashwin could partner Bhajji in the match. For South Africa, they will be glad that they are returning to their fortress. Out of the last 10 ODIs played here, South Africa have been undefeated. In Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe and Wayne Parnell, the possess an awesome pace bowling arsenal that can blow away any batting line-up. South Africa will be depending on these bowlers to trouble the Indian batsmen with some swing and bounce. Tsotsobe, in particular, has troubled the Indian batsmen regularly with his bounce and variations in pace. He will once again be the key man for the South Africans, along with big Morne Morkel.However, batting remains the major concern for the South Africans. In the absence of their talisman, Jacques Kallis, the middle order looks fragile. Smith, Amla, de Villiers and Duminy have contributed at vital times but one failure from either of the four has left the line-up vulnerable. Miller and Ingram have so far failed to impress in this series and that has put a lot of pressure on the other players. This long tail failed to wag in a crunch situation at Johannesburg and Smith will be worried about the composition of the batting line-up.The series is shaping up to be an absolute thriller. Both teams look equal on paper and the only thing that matters now is which team will hold their nerve in tight situations.
