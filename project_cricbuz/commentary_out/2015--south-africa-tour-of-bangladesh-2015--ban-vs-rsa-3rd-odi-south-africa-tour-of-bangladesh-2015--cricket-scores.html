Kyle Abbott will open the attackWelcome back. The Bangladeshi openers are walking out to the middle. Abbott will start the proceedings with the ball.After a rain break that lasted more than 2 hours, the match was reduced to 40 overs per side. Miller and Duminy came out with aggressive intent, especially Miller, who kept employing the sweep shot to score some quick runs. It was Sabbir Rahman's brilliant catch that ended Miller's knock and soon after that, Duminy took it upon himself to take South Africa to a competitive total. Despite wickets falling towards the end, South Africa managed to reach 168 in their 40 overs. Shakib was the pick of the bowlers, taking 3 wickets. Mustafizur and Rubel too chipped in with 2 wickets to their names. After Duckworth-Lewis calculations, the target for Bangladesh will be 170. Take a small 10-minute break and join us for the run-chase after that.South Africa once again got off to a poor start as de Kock fell in the 3rd over itself. With the pitch offering some assistance to the bowlers, the Proteas batsmen failed to get going. du Plessis, Amla and Rossouw too failed to get going and at one stage, South Africa were 50/4. Miller and Duminy then got together and stabilized the innings until the heavens opened up.South Africa will definitely be disappointed with the total on the board. However, without seeing the Bangladeshi batters, it is hard to comment whether Bangladesh have the upper hand right now. Remember, the target will be adjusted for Bangladesh according to Duckworth-Lewis.3

Stay tuned...Weather Report: There's some rain expected later in the day but hopefully, the rain gods will be kind and we will get a result today.In the second ODI, Hashim Amla won the toss and opted to bat. Similar to what happened in the first ODI, South Africa were bowled out for a paltry 162, with Nasir Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman, both picking up 3 wickets each. Bangladesh were struggling when they were 24/2 at one stage, but Soumya Sarkar and Mahmudullah played aggressively and took the attack to the visitors. Together, they put on 135 runs for the 3rd wicket, helping Bangladesh chase the total down in the 28th over itself and taking the series to a decider.Hello and welcome to the third and final ODI between Bangladesh and South Africa. In the first two ODIs, the team that won the toss ended up on the losing side. In the first game, Mashrafe Mortaza opted to bat and Bangladesh could only put on 160. South Africa eventually won the game by 8 wickets, with du Plessis and Rossouw putting together an unbeaten 99-run stand for the third wicket.First England in the World Cup, then Pakistan, after that India, and now South Africa as well, Bangladesh have managed to beat all these top sides in the last 5 months or so. Yes, the team that was consistently tagged as minnows/underdogs, have qualified for the next Champions Trophy, ahead of teams like Pakistan and West Indies. Bangladesh's rise in the last few months has been extraordinary and if they beat South Africa today, they will create history.PreviewHaving inflicted upon South Africa, a crushing series-levelling seven-wicket defeat in Mirpur on Sunday, Bangladesh head to Chittagong with a hope of adding South Africa to the list of high profile teams subjected to ODI series defeats in Bangladesh. To put the potential achievement in perspective, Bangladesh's win on Sunday was their first against the Proteas since the famous win at the Providence Stadium in the 2007 World Cup. A series win here will firmly establish their credentials as a top quality ODI nation. On Tuesday, however, Mashrafe Mortaza and Co. will have one less thing to worry about - qualification to the 2017 Champions Trophy - which has been set in stone now.South Africa could do no wrong on the tour, having run through the T20I series and the opening one-dayer. However, familiar problems resurfaced when Bangladeshi spinners exploited a surface that has been used extensively this season. Hashim Amla put the loss down to a 'bad day at the office' but will have realized that another off-colour batting performance could leave them red-faced. On the bright side, the pitch in Chittagong should be fairly fresh and play quicker than the one used at the Shere Bangla for the second game.Date: July 15, 2015Venue: Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium, ChittagongTime: 09:00 GMT, 14:30 ISTWeather: Humid day with a 50% chance of thunderstorms late in the eveningTeam News:BangladeshBangladesh will persist with the same combination that helped them draw level in the series. The return of star-batsman Mahmudullah from injury has added meat to the line-up. Moreover, Mahmudullah adds a crucial bowling option to the side. However, following another modest outing for Litton Das, there is a growing sense that Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib-al-Hasan are batting a position below their ideal slot in order to accommodate Litton at No 3. The bowling sports a fairly settled look to it and is enhanced by young Mustafizur Rahman's continued success.Probable XI: Soumya Sarkar, Tamim Iqbal, Litton Das, Mahmudullah, Shakib-al-Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza (c), Rubel Hossain, Mustafizur RahmanSouth AfricaSouth Africa are unlikely to change the composition of their side just because of one defeat. However, in the absence of AB de Villiers, the middle-order of JP Duminy, David Miller and Farhaan Behardien appears vulnerable to spin, especially in subcontinent conditions. Hashim Amla, despite toppping the ODI batting averages chart en-route his innings of 22 in the second one-dayer, is yet to get going in the series. Given the class of the man, expect a big innings from him in the decisive game. Meanwhile, in the wake of Kagiso Rabada's good performances, the bowling attack looks settled and potent.Probable XI: Quinton de Kock (wk), Hashim Amla (c), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, JP Duminy, David Miller, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada, Imran TahirStats & Trivia:- Before Sunday, South Africa were last bowled out for a total less than 200 batting first on November 29, 2009 against England in Port Elizabeth- Only Ryan Harris (17) had more wickets in ODIs after five games than Mustafizur does (16)Quotes:"Credit to Bangladesh for playing so well. The decider will be good for the crowd and everyone following it."- A magnanimous Hashim Amla was effusive in his praise for the Bangladesh side"A win is not always important, but the process is. We will try to get the win, but we will definitely get the process right."- Mashrafe Mortaza inisted his team do the processes without worrying about the end result.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla(c), Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Kyle Abbott, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Morne Morkel, Ryan McLaren, Eddie Leie, Wayne Parnell, Aaron PhangisoBangladesh (From): Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Litton Das, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Mustafizur Rahman, Anamul Haque, Jubair Hossain, Arafat SunnyLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
