Steyn will kick off proceedings with two slips in place.South Africa might have done enough to put Zimbabwe out of the tournament as the hosts need to chase this down within 25.2 overs. But, cricket is a funny game. Can the Zimbabwean batsmen achieve the impossible? Or will it be a stroll in the park for Steyn and Co.? Join us in a few minutes to find out...Zimbabwe spinners bowled well to keep the total down to 271, it would have been much less had they held their catches. They bowled 38 off the 50 overs. Williams and Waller were the most economical bowlers. Utseya and Nyumbu supported them well. The visitors got off to a bad start, lost QdK and Amla early. Faf and Rossouw added 70 runs for the third wicket, the latter was looking good before he got a sharp turner from Williams.

SOUTH AFRICA:0.1 Chatara to de Kock, no run, short of length delivery around off, de Kock stays back and defendsde Kock and Amla are at the crease. de Kock is on strike. Chatara will open the attackA moment of silence for Norman Gordon and umpire Quintin John Goosen, as they passed away a few days ago. Chatara will start proceedings. He has 2 slips to assist him. Here we go with the first ball....AB de Villiers: "Hopefully we will start well and take it from there. This is a nice and hard surface. Once we get off to a good start, we have a lot of fire-power in our middle-order and they will be able to boost the total later on. Tahir is out. And so is McLaren as he has a hairline fracture. Nothing serious, he will be fine in a couple of weeks. We are playing an extra batter today as it is important to get a good score. Rossouw and Parnell come in."Chigumbura: "We will bowl first. It is a good wicket today. If we can restrict South Africa to a low score, it will be easier for us. We are going for the bonus point. Sibanda and Madziva come in."Pitch Report: "It is bright and sunny. The wicket is very good. It is very dry. It is going to be quite abrasive. There will be turn for spinners. This is the same track on which South Africa chased 327 against Australia. Team winning the toss will want to field first," reckons Shaun Pollock.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Jean-Paul Duminy, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Aaron Phangiso, Morne MorkelZimbabwe (Playing XI): Vusi Sibanda, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w), Malcolm Waller, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura(c), Prosper Utseya, Neville Madziva, John Nyumbu, Tendai ChataraZimbabwe have won the toss and have opted to fieldWell, this is the scenario that will take Zimbabwe to the final:- If they bat first and score 250, they will have to win by a margin of at least 133 runs. And if South Africa bat first and score 200, Zimbabwe will have to win in 23.3 overs or less.Hello and welcome to the sixth ODI of the Triangular series. Toss and teams coming your way in a few minutes. Stay tuned...South Africa must be wondering what happened. Although they easily defeated Zimbabwe in the bilateral series last month as well as the previous ODI, they will not want to take any risks today. They would definitely play their full team and squash any hopes that Zimbabwe might have of easing through. They, however, will be forced to replace Ryan McLaren, who has a hairline fracture on his arm (thanks to a deadly Mitchell Johnson delivery).Owing to Australia's convincing win over South Africa couple of days ago, Zimbabwe's chances of making it to the final have got slightly harder. The hosts will have to defeat South Africa by a massive margin to boost their run rate and seal the finals spot. They have a strong spin attack which destroyed Australia just days before and their batsmen have at last shown some promise. They will now have to make sure they keep up their performance instead of meekly surrendering as usual.Preview by Bharath RamarajZimbabwe will take on the AB de Villiers-led South African unit in the sixth match of the tri-series at Harare Sports Club. Australia have already qualified for the final of the tri-series. However, there is still a chance that if South Africa lose to Zimbabwe by a massive margin, they may take an early flight back home. Zimbabwe also have a chance to show their wares and push the envelope to defeat the fancied South African setup.The Zimbabwean side must be full of confidence after causing ripples in the cricketing circles with a heart-warming victory against Australia in their last game. On the other hand, South Africa would look to get back to winning ways after losing to Australia.ZimbabweZimbabwe's win against Australia showed that cricket is a game full of glorious uncertainties. However, it is harder to repeat such a performance against another formidable foe and cause a gargantuan upset. On paper, it is clear that South Africa would start as favourities and for Zimbabwe to cause another upset, they have to again punch above their weight.One factor that can favour Zimbabwe is the fact that tracks at Harare have helped the spinners to showcase their bagful of tricks. The decks have offered turn off the track and there is variable bounce too. Zimbabwe do have a slew of spinners and they should play a major role in the game against South Africa.Prosper Utseya, the off-spinner, has kept it simple in the tournament and has reaped the rewards for it by taking seven wickets. John Nymubu, has extracted enough bounce to trouble the batsmen and Sean Williams, the slow left-arm orthodox, too has bowled with good control. The seamers have been a touch inconsistent. However, it is has to be said that the likes of Tendai Chatara and Donald Tiripano are raw and need to add more strings to their bow to do well in the demanding world of ODIs.To throw in a word of caution here, Zimbabwe's batting has only fired in fits and starts. Brendan Taylor, Hamilton Masakadza and Sikandar Raza have shown flashes of brilliance only to gift their wickets away on a platter. Williams has been their most consistent batsman in recent times. Captain, Elton Chigumbura, also gave a glimpse of his willpower to steer Zimbabwe past the finishing line in the game against Australia. His tendency to stand leg-side off the ball especially, against the left-arm pacer, Mitchell Starc, worked against Australia.South AfricaAs South Africa haven't yet assured their place in the tri-series final, they have no other choice but to play their best team. So, the likes of de Villiers, Hashim Amla, Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel are expected to play.South Africa will depend on both Aaron Phangiso and Imran Tahir to take advantage of a track that is offering assistance to spinners. In fact, Tahir, with his wrong 'un will always be a threat in the shorter forms of the game.In the batting department, it is an encouraging sign for South Africa that the mettlesome, Faf du Plessis, has been amassing truckload of runs. The South African think-tank would be happy with the fact that du Plessis has cemented his No.3 spot. He has that ability to change gears as and when required. South Africa would also be hoping for Amla to comeback to rip-roaring form. The ultra consistent batsman hasn't exactly fired on all cylinders in the tournament.Ground conditionsWith five matches being hosted at Harare Sports Club, spinners have come into play by doing well on some tired tracks. Zimbabwe bank upon their spinners to take wickets. The days of Eddo Brandes and the like taking the wind out of opposition's sails with their swing/seam bowling seem to be a thing of the past. The captain winning the toss likely will opt to bat first.QuotesWhen you look at that scorecard now, it looks like we didn't compete and that's the most disappointing thing. Marsh batted exceptionally well, congrats to him. I think we were found wanting in the last 10 overs. The batters are getting really dangerous these days with freedom. I am not worried about the middle-order, probably lost too many wickets. Just that we couldn't get a big partnership. Incredible knock by Faf [du Plessis], he has cemented the No. 3 spot and I am excited to see what he can do for us in the future: AB de Villiers after the game against AustraliaTriviaChigumbura is four short of taking 100 ODI wickets.Teams:South Africa (From): Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock(w), Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Ryan McLaren, Dale Steyn, Aaron Phangiso, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Mthokozisi Shezi, Kyle Abbott, Wayne Parnell, Rilee RossouwZimbabwe (From): Tino Mawoyo, Sikandar Raza, Hamilton Masakadza, Brendan Taylor(w), Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura(c), Malcolm Waller, Prosper Utseya, John Nyumbu, Tendai Chatara, Donald Tiripano, Luke Jongwe, Shingirai Masakadza, Tafadzwa Kamungozi, Brian Vitori, Vusi Sibanda, Neville Madziva, Timycen Maruma, Natsai Mushangwe, Curthbert MusokoLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
