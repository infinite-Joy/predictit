SRI LANKA:20.1 20.1Peterson to Dilhara Fernando, out Lbw!! That's all folks. Sri Lanka fold for their lowest score in ODI history. Peterson ends the fun with an arm ball, Fernando was late in bringing his bat down for the defensive stroke, got struck in front of middle stump and that would have gone on to hit middle and leg. A tame surrender by the Sri Lankans, South Africa go 1-0 up with a whopping 258 run victory. Dilhara Fernando lbw b Peterson 0(1) Peterson to Dilhara Fernando, THATS OUT!!

Morne Morkel will open the attackAn eventful afternoon at Paarl. Smith fell early but Kallis and Amla looked good until a run out ended Kallis' stay. In came skipper de Villiers to partner Amla and the duo didn't allow the momentum to dip. De Villiers fell after an aggressive half century but Amla carried on to reach yet another ton. South Africa looked good to post much more than 300, especially when Amla and Albie were batting, but a late collapse triggered by the death overs specialist - Malinga - kept them down to 301. This is still a good batting track, and Sri Lanka surely have the ability to chase it down. Let's hope for an entertaining evening, join us in a while for the chase.4
SOUTH AFRICA:49.6  Malinga to Morne Morkel, 1 run, there comes another yorker, this time Morne manages to jam it down towards cover for a single, South Africa end up with 301 but Sri Lanka will be happy with the way they finished.

There will be some bounce on the track and it should stay true throughout the game.Dilshan: After the return of Malinga and Kulasekara it is a good bowling unit. The batting unit is also experienced and we will look to bowl well to restrict them. It looks to be a very good ODI track.ABD: We're going to have a bat first. It looks like a nice wicket and hopefully we can put a good score on the board. Albie Morkel comes in at 7 and Robin Peterson at 8. Looking forward to the captaincy. I have to make some big calls and I'm up for it.South Africa won the toss and elected to bat firstHello and welcome to our coverage of the first ODI between Sri Lanka and South Africa. A new start for South Africa as AB de Villiers takes charge for the ODIs. Sri Lanka will be buoyed with the return of the talismanic Lasith Malinga. The Lankans have not played much cricket in South Africa and their batting will be heavily dependent on the likes of Sangakkara and Jayawardene. The toss could play an important part in the game so stay tuned to find out what happens there.Preview by Karthik LakshmananNot many in the cricketing world gave Sri Lanka a chance to win a Test match when they landed in South Africa last month. Despite the cynicism surrounding them, the visitors did manage to end their losing streak in the longer format with a memorable victory at Durban. South Africa bounced back to win the next match (and hence the series) at Cape Town, but the visitors will be silently confidentabout their chances in the ODI series, especially after their Durban win. The ODI series also poses contrasting challenges for the rival skippers; Sri Lanka's Dilshan has had a rough time ever since he took charge, while South Africa's AB de Villiers will look for a good start in his new role. Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka's ODI performances suffered a steep slide ever along with their Test performances, ever since they ended up as runners up in the World Cup in April, 2011. Sri Lanka, looking for a fresh start under new skipper Tillakaratne Dilshan, began by surrendering to the Australians in home conditions. If losing to Australia at home wasn't enough, the Lankans suffered an embarrassing 1-4 defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the UAE. If anything, the series in South Africa will pose a tougher challenge, but Sri Lanka will take some positives out of the recently concluded Test series. The batting line up wears a familiar look and is heavily dependent on the seniors - Sangakkara, Dilshan and Jayawardene. Lasith Malinga's presence in the ODI squad should bolster the pace attack, as he will enjoy the pacer friendly conditions in South Africa. The venue for the first ODI - Paarl - is known to be one of South Africa's slowest tracks, which could suit the visitors. The nature of the wicket could also make Sri Lanka play Ajantha Mendis, who did not feature in the Tests, along with left arm spinner Rangana Herath. Mendis and Herath were impressive in the tour game against Emerging Cape Cobras, picking up 3 wickets each to spin Sri Lanka to a victory. South Africa: South Africa's home ODI series against Sri Lanka will mark the birth of a new chapter in their limited overs cricket. Like their opponents, South Africa too seeked a change of guard post the World Cup and appointed a new skipper in AB de Villiers for the One Day Internationals. The Proteas did play a short series against the visiting Australians, but a hand injury kept de Villiers out of the squad, leaving the captaincy job to Hashim Amla. The task for the new captain became tougher on the day the squad was announced, as he was also selected as the wicket-keeper in place of out-of-form Mark Boucher. De Villiers has the luxury of a settled squad to assist him in his new innings, and even has former skipper Graeme Smith and senior players like Kallis to turn to. Contrary to the Sri Lankans, South Africa's ODI squad wears a different look compared to the team that played the Tests. Only six of the South Africans played the Tests, compared to the 10 in the Sri Lankan squad. Even Vernon Philander - the new sensation in the SA Test squad - failed to get a place in the limited overs version. Leg spinner Imran Tahir misses out as well, and ODI regulars Johan Botha and Robin Peterson are the two spinners in the squad. The injury to batsman Dean Elgar provides another chance to all rounder Albie Morkel, who hasn't featured in the national squad since September 2010. Pacer Rory Kleinveldt, who has appeared in Twenty20 internationals, is the only player in the squad who does not have an ODI cap, and might have to wait for his turn as South Africa already have enough pacers in Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Wayne Parnell. Quotes"They are a nation with a bit of a carefree spirit, if you like. They play with plenty of flair, and they've added a couple of one-day specialists now, like Lasith Malinga, (Nuwan) Kulasekara and the spinner (Ajantha) Mendis" Albie Morkel says South Africa will not be complacent against the Lankans."Only time will tell whether I'll get another chance to do that. I doubt whether I'll still be able to play for another 10 years, because no one has the right to play in South Africa. It's a privilege that you have to earn" Kallis says he will try and play till the 2015 World Cup.Teams:South Africa (From): AB de Villiers(w/c), Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Johan Botha, Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Rory Kleinveldt, Albie Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Lonwabo TsotsobeSri Lanka (From): Tillakaratne Dilshan(c), Kumar Sangakkara(w), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Dilhara Fernando, Rangana Herath, Mahela Jayawardene, Ajantha Mendis, Thissara Perera, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dhammika Prasad, Nuwan Kulasekara, Kosala Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Upul TharangaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
