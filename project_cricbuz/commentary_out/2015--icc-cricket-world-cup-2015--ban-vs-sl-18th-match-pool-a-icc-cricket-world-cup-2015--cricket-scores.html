They have generally bowled a touch fuller when compared to Bangladesh's bowlers. However, just like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka too have put up a below par performance in the field. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 20 overs: Bangladesh continued to flounder during the middle overs. Anamul Haque, who was dropped by Tillakaratne Dilshan in the second over of the innings, was eventually run out, with Angelo Mathews effecting a direct hit. Bangladesh's batsmen have clearly not shown good communication in terms of running between the wickets. Mahmudullah, known for his ability to come good when the chips are down, then was dismissed by Thisara Perera. To make it worse for them, just when Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim had stitched an enterprising partnership, Shakib's wicket was snared by Dilshan.

BANGLADESH:15.2 Herath to Mahmudullah, no run, tossed up and just outside off, defended towards coverThere was also a bit of controversy. Sri Lanka reviewed a caught behind decision, but Snickometer wasn't available for that particular ball and Mominul survived. However, Mominul was dismissed the next delivery and the review was re-instated. The outfield is lightning quick and the batsmen can hit through the line on this deck. But Bangladesh have lost the plot by losing too many wickets upfront. Malinga continued to terrorise Bangladesh's batsmen. In fact, with an in-swinging yorker, he hit Soumya Sarkar flush on his toes, but it was going down the leg side. Sarkar, then opened up his shoulders to crack sparkling shots through the off-side. It was his ability to get on top of the bounce that helped him to give Sri Lanka's seamers a fitting riposte. Unfortunately for Bangladesh, he tried to play one shot too many and Angelo Mathews snared his wicket with a slower one. With Mominul Haque too edging a delivery from Suranga Lakmal to Mahela Jayawardene at first slip to take a long walk back to the pavilion, Bangladesh found themselves in trouble. It has to be said that Lakmal bowled a fine spell. He can certainly surprise the batsman for a bit of pace. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 15 overs: Lasith Malinga bounded to the crease with intensity and vigour to trouble Bangladesh's batsmen with late swing. The battering ram of Sri Lanka's pace attack, who has struggled for form in this World Cup, gave them a perfect start by shattering the stumps of Tamim Iqbal. Iqbal, paid the price for showing poor judgement outside the off-stump by playing inside the line of the ball. It was crystal clear that Tamim wasn't expecting the ball to hold its line and knock over the off-stump.Drinks are on the field now
BANGLADESH:15.1 Herath to Mahmudullah, out Anamul Run Out!! That's disaster for Bangladesh, the running was always suspect between these two. This was tossed up and on the stumps, Mahmudullah worked it to the right of mid-wicket and took a step or two down the track. Anamul responded and was almost half-way down the pitch before being sent back. Mathews runs across, picks up the ball and hits the stumps at the bowler's end, Anamul was way short of his ground. The third umpire sends him on his way. Bangladesh have lost their fourth wicket. Anamul run out (Mathews) 29(43) [4s-1 6s-1]Herath to Mahmudullah, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Call for a run-out.

Anamul was watching the fielder who makes a tumbling stop. On seeing this, Mahmudullah runs back to his crease while Anamul sets off for the single.

Malinga will open the attackThe openers are out.. they need to give their team a solid start if they are to come anywhere close to 333. Two slips in place as Malinga steams in..Welcome back.. Bangladesh did a lap of honour after beating Afghanistan in their first WC match. They would deserve a standing ovation if they chase down this target set by Sri LankaSangakkara: "It was nice to get the hundred, it was nice to watch Dilshan bat as well from the other end, but I think it was set-up by that great opening partnership. In the morning all the boys were wishing me good luck for the 400th game, so it was nice to get a hundred. When the game evolves, you've got to evolve with it and I've just tried to stay with the pace of the younger guys coming in and innovating. It is a great pleasure to be able to still play ODI cricket. It is interesting as well, two new balls and then field restrictions, so there is always an opportunity for you to score. I wish (asked if he could play for 10 more years), what you see from the outside, my body from the inside will tell you that it is getting old. I think it is a really good wicket, we are pretty happy with the runs on the board, but we've really got to put in a great effort on the field. Whatever happens, whether they get it or we win easily, or we win a tight game, the real key is to play as well as we can, so when go off the field we know we've given it all."In the first over of the innings, Anamul Haque dropped a rather easy catch at widish first slip off Mortaza's bowling to give Lahiru Thirimanne a reprieve. Mushfiqur Rahim then, missed a stumping chance off Sabbir Rahman to give Thirimanne another reprieve. To make it worse for them, Taskin dropped a caught and bowled chance when Sangakkara was on 23. The deck is flat, but Bangladesh's batsmen need to play out of their skins to win the game from here. Earlier, Dilshan and Lahiru Thirimanne gave Sri Lanka a rousing start with a century stand for the first wicket. Thirimanne looked short of confidence, but took advantage of the missed chances to compile a fifty before he was dismissed by Rubel. On the other hand, Bangladesh were lacklustre. Barring, Mashrafe Mortaza, their bowlers struggled to hit good lengths. With a strong-shouldered action, Taskin, bowled with good pace, but struggled for consistency. Rubel too was below par. On a flat deck, their spinners were ineffective as well. To cap of a miserable day for Bangladesh, they missed a slew of chances. On the other hand, it was a trademark innings from Sangakkara. With quickness of hands and feet, he thwacked Bangladesh's bowlers to all parts of the ground. The way he picked a slower one from Rubel to smash the seamer down the ground, with precise metre of timing, illustrated Sangakkara's ability to pick the length quickly. He also used the depth of the crease to keep the spinners guessing. When Taskin pitched it up, Dilshan essayed sumptuous drives and when it was banged in short, he rocked back in a flash to play forceful pulls. In fact, in the 45th over of the innings, he clobbered Taskin for 16 runs in a single over. Dilshan also showed his ability to improvise by getting down on one knee to scoop Rubel Hossain for a boundary. He even used the switch-hit to smash Shakib Al Hasan for a four in the 48th over of the innings.Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara stitched a magnificent partnership to ruthlessly dismantle Bangladesh's attack and help Sri Lanka notch up a mammoth score on the board. Dilshan composed his 21st century and Sangakkara, playing in his 400th ODI, followed it up by essaying an awe-inspiring ton as well. Sangakkara got to his hundred in a mere 73 deliveries. It also turned out to be his fastest ODI hundred. Initially, Dilshan struggled for timing, but once he got set, produced a superb exhibition of batsmanship. It was Taskin Ahmed, who came in for harsh treatment, as Dilshan took advantage of the extra pace on offer to despatch him for a flurry of boundaries. All the Bangladeshi players came up to Dilshan and shook his hands.4

He has a shy at the non-striker's end as Sanga tries to take a run but there was no one backing up. Rubel was disappointed with the drop and did not bother going upto the stumps to collect the throw.

Sanga wants a chewing gum and the 12th man runs in to give him one.Dilshan's opening partner, Lahiru Thirimanne, looked short of confidence. After Thirimanne was dropped by Anamaul Haque in the first over of the innings, Mushfiqur Rahim gave the left-hander another reprieve by missing a stumping chance off Sabbir Rahman's bowling. It was Rubel Hossain, who finally dismissed Thirimanne. Kumar Sangakkara then, playing in his 400th ODI, made his intentions clear by guiding Rubel over the slips for a boundary. It has to be said that other than Mashrafe Mortaza, Bangladesh's pacers haven't been able to hit good lengths consistently. Even their fielding hasn't been up to the mark. Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the last 16 overs: During the middle part of the innings, Tillakaratne Dilshan upped the tempo by cracking a flurry of boundaries. He took a heavy toll on Taskin Ahmed's bowling. Dilshan used Taskin's extra pace to bisect the gaps in the field. When Taskin pitched the ball up, Dilshan essayed crunching drives and as soon as the pacer banged it short, he played forceful pull shots. Initially, Dilshan was closing the bat face and struggled for timing, but once he got set, produced a fine exhibition of stroke-play. On the other hand, Taskin, with a strong-shouldered action, generated a good burst of pace, but couldn't bowl with control. It's time for drinks!

However, Rubel Hossain struggled for consistency while bowling to Thirimanne. It also has to be said that the Sri Lankan batsmen have looked to shorten their back-lift while facing up to Rubel, as he is skiddy through the air. The ball is perhaps stopping a bit on the batsman, but it is still a good wicket for batting.Here is Bharath Ramaraj's analysis of the first 16 overs: After Sri Lanka won the toss and opted to bat, Mashrafe Mortaza bowled with verve and purpose to trouble the opposition ranks. Mortaza produced the edge off Lahiru Thirimanne's bat, but Anamul Haque dropped the catch at first slip. Thirimanne continued to flirt with danger by playing with an angled bat. Interestingly, Mortaza again induced Thirimanne to edge a fine delivery that shaped away from the left-hander, but luckily for him, it pierced the gap between the wicket-keeper and the widish first slip. For Sri Lanka, Tillakaratne Dilshan, after making a cautious start, stamped his authority on the proceedings by collecting a couple of boundaries in the 8th over of the innings.

SRI LANKA:0.5 Mortaza to Thirimanne, 1 run, length delivery outside off, Thirimanne gets forward to defend, gets a thick outside edge towards third man
SRI LANKA:0.4 Mortaza to Thirimanne, no run, dropped at first slip by Anamul Haque! Very poor cricket that from the fielder. This was shaping away from the batsman, Thirimanne goes fishing, gets a thick outside edge and the ball flies to the widish slip fielder, the ball pops out of his hands the first time and he keeps fumbling, juggles it thrice before dropping
SRI LANKA:0.3 Mortaza to Thirimanne, no run, on a good length and well away from the batsman, Thirimanne ends up playing a loose shot, goes chasing after it and is beaten comprehensively
SRI LANKA:0.2 Mortaza to Thirimanne, no run, pitched outside leg, Thirimanne looks to flick but it hits his pad and rolls down the wicket
SRI LANKA:0.1 Mortaza to Thirimanne, no run, length delivery on middle to start off, Thirimanne presents the full face of the bat and defends it backThirimanne and Dilshan are at the crease. Thirimanne is on strike. Mortaza will open the attackThe Bangladeshi players are in a huddle. They break up now and are taking the field. Openers Dilshan and Thirimanne are walking out to the middle. Mortaza will open the bowling attack for Bangladesh. A slip and a gully to assist him. Here we go...The players walking out for the national anthems. Alright, we are done. Just minutes away now from the start of the game.By the way, Kumar Sangakkara is playing his 400th ODI today. He is only the fourth player after Sachin Tendulkar, Sanath Jayasuriya and Mahela Jayawardene to get to this landmark.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dimuth Karunaratne, Mahela Jayawardene, Angelo Mathews(c), Dinesh Chandimal, Thisara Perera, Rangana Herath, Lasith Malinga, Suranga LakmalBangladesh (Playing XI): Anamul Haque, Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Sabbir Rahman, Mashrafe Mortaza(c), Rubel Hossain, Taskin AhmedMortaza: "We would have liked to bat first as well, but the wicket is not gonna change much, hopefully we will bowl well and restrict them to a good total. We've got no change, we are playing the same team."Mathews: "It has been a slow start for us, but we are slowly picking ourselves up. We have got the big names and the experience and I am sure they will peak at the right time. Of course he (Jeevan Mendis) is an all-rounder, he contributes, with both bat and ball but it's going to be a big loss but Upul Tharanga is also equally good so we hope for his best. We will bat first, it looks a really good wicket, it might skid a bit early on, but it will probably stay the same. We have got one change, Chandimal comes in for Jeevan Mendis."Sri Lanka have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "Always good having a look at the MCG pitch. There is a little bit of grass, there are some bare patches so there might be a little bit of inconsistent bounce, but I think the new ball will stay new, bit of swing and seam. But the batsmen should be able to score heavily. There is a bit of grass cover and it will help the new ball move around a bit. It could be a two-paced pitch, but still it is a hard surface, so there should be plenty of runs," reckon Damien Fleming and Sunil Gavaskar.Lasith Malinga is warming up nicely. The toss is not too far away. Stay tuned.Head-to-head: Sri Lanka have beaten Bangladesh in both their World Cup games so far. If Chaminda Vaas' record hat-trick blew Bangladesh away in 2003, four years later, Sri Lanka registered a massive 198-run win at Port of Spain.Weather update: It's a cloudy day at the MCG, but there are no showers expected. Southwesterly winds are blowing through, and that should make the playing conditions a lot better, when compared to the Sunday encounter between India and South AfricaSri LankaSri Lanka haven't been at their best so far in the tournament. In their inaugural match, fifties from Brendon McCullum, Kane Williamson and Corey Anderson helped New Zealand post a massive total. In reply, apart from Lahiru Thirimanne, the Sri Lankan batsmen could not handle the pressure of a run chase as a collective effort from the New Zealand bowlers helped them enjoy a 98-run victory.In their second match, Afghanistan ran Sri Lanka very closely, only to lose it at the fag end. Having been asked to bat first, Afghanistan rode on Asghar Stanikzai's fifty to post 232 on the board. In reply, Angelo Mathews and Co. were jolted very early as Thirimanne, Dilshan and Sangakkara were dismissed very cheaply. However, Mahela Jayawardene used all his experience, treated the bowling on merit and scored a magnificent hundred to help his side get closer to the victory. Captain Mathews too played a decent innings, but the Afghans came back strongly by dismissing both set batsmen in quick succession. A cameo then from Thisara Perera helped Sri Lanka get past the line with 10 balls to spare.Skipper Mathews admitted that his side has not played to its potential. "The game against Afghanistan was a close one, we need to improve our standards. What we need to learn is to dominate from ball one and stay in the game till the end. We have not played our best cricket yet. If we play the way we can, we can beat any team in the world. We have got to step up and set our goals high. Play every game as a final or a semi-final. The batters have to score runs and the bowlers have to take wickets."BangladeshMashrafe Mortaza and Co. had a good beginning to their World Cup campaign. Although the top-order did not justify the captain's call to bat first, experienced campaigners Mushfiqur Rahim and Shakib Al Hasan bailed the side out of trouble with a century stand. The bowlers then, led by the captain himself, rattled the Afghans and bowled them out for 162 to enjoy a comprehensive 105-run win.The fact that Bangladesh's second match against Australia was washed off puts them in a better space as that one point could prove crucial for their chances of making it to the last eight. Speaking ahead of the match, captain Mortaza had this to say: "We don't like backing our pace bowlers in Bangladesh, but we have good pace bowlers. After just one game, everyone is talking about Taskin and Rubel, that they can bowl well and with good pace. There is true bounce in these wickets so we have to play the extra pace bowler."13:15 Local Time, 02:15 GMT, 07:45 IST: Hello there! The action now shifts to the picturesque MCG for this Pool A encounter between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It is an important game for both the teams as a win here would put them in a better position to progress to the quarterfinals. Just a few days ago, we had a 300+ score on the board at this venue and the surface here is normally a good batting track. So what's in store for us in this contest between the two Asian teams? We'll find out as the day progresses.PreviewFirst a 98-run thrashing against New Zealand, then a by-the-skin-of-teeth win against Afghanistan. It's easy to observe that Sri Lanka's ICC World Cup campaign hasn't been up to the mark and now they face a buoyant Bangladesh, a team that has collected three points from two matches in Pool A following a win against Afghanistan and a washout against Australia.With the washout at Brisbane, Bangladesh can now fancy themselves for the quarter-finals and that possibility may just give them extra springs when they play their subcontinental neighbours on Thursday. The way they celebrated their win against Afghanistan is indicative of how desperate they are to do well and Sri Lanka, the runners-up in 2011, need to improve their performance a few notches to get the better of Mashrafe Mortaza's spirited men.Venue: Melbourne Cricket GroundStart: 9 am ISTWeather: It will be mostly sunny with the temperatures vacillating between 14 and 25 degrees Celsius.Team News:BangladeshThey are likely to field the same XI they used against Afghanistan. They batted deep in that match, and against Sri Lanka, they will do well not to tinker with the winning composition.Probable XI 1 Tamim Iqbal, 2 Anamul Haque, 3 Soumya Sarkar, 4 Mahmudullah, 5 Shakib Al Hasan, 6 Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), 7 Sabbir Rahman, 8 Mominul Haque, 9 Mashrafe Mortaza (c), 10 Taskin Ahmed, 11 Rubel HossainSri LankaUpul Tharanga has replaced Jeevan Mendis whose tournament is over following a hamstring injury, but it's highly unlikely that Tharanga will be drafted into the XI straight away. Instead, medium pacer Dushmantha Chameera looks like the favourite to get a game.Probable XI 1 Lahiru Thirimanne, 2 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (wk), 4 Dimuth Karunaratne, 5 Mahela Jayawardene, 6 Angelo Mathews (c), 7 Thisara Perera, 8 Dushmantha Chameera, 9 Rangana Herath, 10 Lasith Malinga, 11 Suranga LakmalPlayers to watch out for:With the captaincy load not bogging him down any longer, Mushfiqur Rahim is the man Bangladesh are heavily dependent on in the batting department. Expect him to play his grafter role to perfection. As to Sri Lanka, it could be Tillakaratne Dilshan's time to turn the corner. He has been sub-standard so far and it could be his day tomorrow.Quotes:The game against Afghanistan was a close one, we need to improve our standards.
