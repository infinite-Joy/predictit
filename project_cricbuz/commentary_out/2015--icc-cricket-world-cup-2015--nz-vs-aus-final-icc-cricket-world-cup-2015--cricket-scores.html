AUSTRALIA:33.1 33.1Matt Henry to S Smith, FOUR, Australia win the World Cup for the fifth time. 1987 - Eden Gardens, 1999 - Lord's, 2003 - Wanderers, 2007 - Kensington Oval, but winning at the MCG at home must be really special. India did it four years ago chasing at the Wankhede in a final and today, Australia have done it at the MCG. Michael Clarke's won a World Cup in his first attempt as captain and what a way to end your ODI career. Shortish slower delivery just outside off stump, Smith rocks back and pulls it behind square on the on-side, the ball runs away to the fence.

Brendon McCullum runs up to Clarke and congratulates him. Tim Southee joins in as well. Clarke raises his bat to the crowd and gets a bit emotional as well. Now he points the bat up towards the sky, probably in remembrance of Phil Hughes.

AUSTRALIA:20.1 Matt Henry to Clarke, no run, starts the over with a yorker, right on the base of off-stump, Clarke brings his bat down and jams it in front of coverIt was the Australian skipper, Michael Clarke, playing in his last ODI, who replaced Warner at the crease. Clarke, definitely would look to sign off from ODI cricket in style by playing a fine hand. From New Zealand's perspective, Henry could have banged it short from around the wicket and tested Clarke's defence.Trent Boult continued to swing the ball, but it was Matt Henry, who provided the crucial breakthrough by dismissing David Warner. Henry has that uncanny ability to surprise the batsman for a bit of pace. After Warner pulled Henry for a crunching boundary, he came back well by hitting the bat hard to take the prized scalp. Henry could have also taken the wicket of Steven Smith, but an inside edge rolled onto the stumps and the bails didn't come off. It isn't the first time that it has happened in this World Cup.

It also resulted in Brendon McCullum pushing the field back and Warner edged through the vacant second slip for a boundary. New Zealand can win this game only by bowling out Australia, so they need to look for wickets. McCullum also introduced Daniel Vettori into the attack, but he was struggling to pivot his left leg and the troublesome Achilles tendon seemed to be affecting him. Trent Boult bowled it full and swung the new ball to trouble the openers up front. Boult was rewarded for his effort with the wicket of Aaron Finch. The Kookaburra doesn't swing for long and from New Zealand's perspective, they made good use of the new ball for the first few overs

Southee will open the attackTwo slips and a gully in place as Southee steams inThe players are out in the middle.. Australia are on the cusp of their fifth World Cup title. Only an inspired burst from New Zealand's bowlers can stop them..Welcome back.. New Zealand dismissed Australia for 151 during their league phase match in Auckland. But that was a match with very little pressure, not so today. Can Boult & Co. repeat their pyrotechnics at the MCG? They need early wickets, else this will be all over in a hurryFaulkner: "Obviously pretty good start by the boys. It's in our hands to chase the runs and if we start well there is no reason why we can't (chase this down). Pretty good MCG wicket really. I thought it was a little bit slow than we are used to, but pretty good all-round wicket. One aspect we have been working hard on is our fielding, another strong performance and hopefully like I said we can start well with the bat and chase this total down. The outfield is pretty standard, maybe a little bit quicker than normal, but the ground is in fantastic condition. It is in our hands now."It has never been easy to chase down targets at the MCG under lights as it tends to zip through the wicket. However, New Zealand have to play out of their skins to lift the glittering trophy from here.The battle-hardened cricketer, Elliott continued to play with a singular aim to succeed before he eventually got out for a tenacious innings of 83. For Australia, it wasn't just about the trio of Starc, Johnson and Hazlewood, who shone brightly. Faulkner too teased and tempted the batsmen to their downfall with his variations and picked up three crucial wickets.It was left to Elliott and Taylor to stand up to the trial by fire. Both the batsmen farmed the strike in a clinical manner. Initially, they found runs hard to come by, but Elliott frustrated Australia with cheeky shots through the third man region. Elliott certainly played with unhurried swagger at the crease. Taylor struggled to find gaps with needlepoint precision, but he showed the resolve to forge a century stand with Elliott. It was in the 36th over when the game turned on its head. It was James Faulkner, who landed decisive blows by picking up the scalps of Taylor and Corey Anderson. With Luke Ronchi too losing his wicket, Australia just took a vice-like on the proceedings.Earlier, with 91,112 fans at the stadium, it drummed up an electric atmosphere. It was Mitchell Starc, who breathed fire by generating swing to knock over the dangerman, Brendon McCullum, in the first over of the innings. Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Johnson backed it up by bristling with energy and untiring discipline. After playing with poise and balance against the pacers, Martin Guptill threw his wicket away by getting out to the part-timer, Glenn Maxwell. Kane Williamson, known for his ice-cool temperament, then lobbed it back to Johnson. The Australian bowlers put up a thoroughly professional show to bundle out the opposition for a below par total. In fact, after losing early wickets, Ross Taylor and Grant Elliott soothed the jangling nerves in the New Zealand camp with confident strides and the pair looked set to take them to a competitive total. However, they lost a slew of wickets in the slog overs and ended up with a modest score.What a performance by Australia. Thoroughly professional and come the big day - in a World Cup final, they are a different beast. A powerful beast that runs over all opposition. We have seen that in 1999. In 2003. In 2007 and again now in 2015. Just need to finish it off with the bat. Wouldn't be surprised if they chase this down in 35 overs, trying to make a statement. Wouldn't put it past Australia to do anything in a World Cup final. Truly great sides come to the party when the heat is on and the Aussies are the best in doing that. Coming back to the final dismissal, Clarke gave a big beaming smile and seemed quite happy as well as stunned with that athletic effort from Maxi.4
NEW ZEALAND:44.6 Johnson to Boult, out Southee Run Out!! Fab from Maxi and he has just produced a spark from nowhere to extinguish this innings. It was pushed to him at a short mid-wicket position, he fielded and realised that Southee was out of his crease, rifled in a throw and hit direct. Southee was trying to get the bat in, then tried with his foot, both failed as Maxi was too quick. Maxi knew it as soon as he hit, the third umpire was needed as the fielder was very quick. No way the umpire would've known. Southee run out (Maxwell) 11(11) [6s-1]Johnson to Boult, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!Has Big Show run Southee out? Southee didn't get the bat down. He was trying to. But replays show that he is gone. The big screen confirms the same. Loud cheer greets the fall of that wicket.

NEW ZEALAND:44.5 Johnson to Matt Henry, out Caught by Starc!! Low full toss outside off, Matt Henry has somehow sliced that to cover-point. A very soft dismissal that. Johnson pumps his fist.

Caught!!Now round the wicket. Four in on the off-side

NEW ZEALAND:42.4 Johnson to Matt Henry, no run, too quick and too fast for Matt Henry, he tries to back away and pull, misses the short ball by a long way. That short delivery had some gas from Johnson

NEW ZEALAND:42.1 Johnson to Southee, SIX, Southee welcomes Johnson with a six over long-on. Made room and cleared his front leg, before lofting it into the crowd. Connected it off the middle of the bat and is a bit surprised by his hit. Punches gloves with Matt Henry

NEW ZEALAND:41.5 Faulkner to Elliott, out Caught by Haddin!! Faulkner and Haddin give Elliott a send-off. Not needed I guess. Elliott looks at them and doesn't respond at all. Just keeps walking back. Before he goes off, raises the bat and goes in. It was a brilliantly disguised back of the hand slower delivery, Elliott early into the leg-side swipe and the thick outside edge looped to Haddin. He did all he could, but his lack of partners at the other end meant he had to go for it. Elliott c Haddin b Faulkner 83(82) [4s-7 6s-1]Faulkner to Elliott, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
NEW ZEALAND:41.4 Faulkner to Elliott, no run, looked like the slower delivery, Elliott is on the front foot and drives straight to the fielder at cover. No timing on that at all

Strong wrists from Elliott on displayTim Southee, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:40.6 Johnson to Vettori, out Bowled!! Johnson yorks Vettori. Well almost as replays show that the attempted yorker was a foot short. Full and sliding down, but tail involved, Vettori as is his wont, looks to clip to leg, all the time, this time the ball brushes the pad and goes onto hit the stumps. Vettori nods in appreciation at that delivery from Johnson and walks off head bowed. Johnson roars in delight. The last batting stint for Vettori in New Zealand colors. Vettori b Johnson 9(21) [4s-1]Johnson to Vettori, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

NEW ZEALAND:40.3 Johnson to Elliott, no run, and he fields that to his right at slip after Elliott opens the face of the bat and guides it. Elliott has been playing that shot really well and getting runs, not that time. Clarke has a smile at the end of it allClarke has kept himself at slip for Elliott
NEW ZEALAND:40.2 Johnson to Vettori, 1 run, shuffles across and works the back of a length delivery in front of mid-on, quick single taken
NEW ZEALAND:40.1 Johnson to Vettori, no run, Vettori has failed to connect with the late dab. He rarely fails to do so, but did there. The width was there but he couldn't lay bat on ballMitchell Johnson [6.0-0-19-1] is back into the attackNew Zealand have scored just 15 off the batting powerplay and lost three wickets. Not a good one for themIt is a big game, but for New Zealand to put the opposition under any kind of pressure, they need a score of around 240-250. On their part, Australia stuck to the basics of not giving any room for the batsmen and that paid them rich dividends.With Ross Taylor and Grant Elliott stitching a century stand, it seemed like they had laid the platform for New Zealand to notch up a competitive total. Elliott's ability to open the bat face and play cheeky shots through the third man region frustrated the opposition. However, just in the nick of time, James Faulkner struck twice in one over and Mitchell Starc dismissed Luke Ronchi to leave New Zealand in trouble. 
NEW ZEALAND:39.6 Faulkner to Vettori, 1 run, Vettori gets forward and pushes it to mid-on, calls for the quick single and gets it

NEW ZEALAND:39.1 Faulkner to Elliott, no run, nips back in and catches Elliott on the back thigh, wasn't forward and missed the defensive shot. Clarke relcuctantly went for a review, he was forced to by Haddin and Faulkner. It was umpire's call as it was just clippingAustralia are going for a lbw review against Elliott. Not-out was the original call. 'Fair delivery, spin vision, front on and then RTS to follow. Just rock and roll that for me please. No bat involved. Ball-tracking if you have it ready. Ball-tracking coming now. Pitching outside. Impact in-line. It's umpire's call and you can stay with your decision. You are on camera now, you can make your decision, thank you.' Elliott survives!

NEW ZEALAND:37.3 Faulkner to Vettori, no run, full and on the stumps, clipped straight to the fielder at mid-wicket
NEW ZEALAND:37.2 Faulkner to Vettori, no run, Vettori plays all around a back of a length delivery outside off and completely plays down the wrong line, the ball misses the inside edgeVettori stops Faulkner midway as he isn't happy with movement behind the bowler's arm. Faulkner goes up and sorts things out near the sightscreen. A beach ball is the issue, distracting Vettori. 'It had to be yellow' chirps Ian Smith on air, who is on fire today - after seeing the color of the beach ballSachin is seen at the 'G'. All suited and booted. Mark Waugh on air reckons he looks like a rockstar after initially pretending not to know him
NEW ZEALAND:37.1 Faulkner to Elliott, leg byes, 1 run, nips back in and catches Elliott on the pad, it was going over and Vettori pushes Elliott through for the leg bye. No real appeal for lbw as the Aussies knew it was going over

NEW ZEALAND:36.2 Starc to Ronchi, out Caught by Clarke!! Ronchi goes for a duck. Good catch at slip to his left by Clarke. He catches and then throws the ball up in the air in delight.

NEW ZEALAND:35.3 Faulkner to Corey Anderson, out Bowled!! Look at that roar from Faulkner. He has knocked over Corey Anderson. Full fast and straight on middle, Corey Anderson like McCullum was slow in bringing the bat down. Was he expecting a short one? The weight was on the back foot, the feet didn't move, the bat came down slow and the ball found its way through. Australia come storming back after a hundred run stand. Corey Anderson b Faulkner 0(2)Faulkner to Corey Anderson, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
NEW ZEALAND:35.2 Faulkner to Corey Anderson, no run, full and on the stumps, wristed straight to the fielder at mid-onCorey Anderson, left handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:35.1 Faulkner to Ross Taylor, out Caught by Haddin!! If he had left that, would've been close to a wide. But Ross Taylor reached out and jammed at the fuller length back of the hand slower delivery, it wasn't a bump ball, went straight off the edge and Haddin diving took it one-handed to his right. The ball got stuck in the webbing and he was sure initially, that he took it, but then seemed unsure. Strange. It was referred and the third umpire made the right decision. Ross Taylor c Haddin b Faulkner 40(72) [4s-2]Faulkner to Ross Taylor, THATS OUT!! Caught!!James Faulkner [4.0-0-18-0] is back into the attackHaddin and Faulkner are going up for a caught behind appeal. Dharma and Kettleborough are conferring. They go upstairs. 'We are checking for bump ball first and then clean catch' says Erasmus. 'It's not a bump ball, so we are checking for the catch. Just rock and roll that from me please, maybe one from square on the off-side, you can zoom that as well for me please. Excellent, can you rock and roll that. To the big screen, please put out. Thank you!' Ross Taylor is gone. That is a huge wicket off the first ball of the batting powerplay

NEW ZEALAND:34.4 Watson to Ross Taylor, 1 run, good length outside off, wristed to mid-on, for a quick single
NEW ZEALAND:34.3 Watson to Ross Taylor, no run, Smith is brilliant at point. He goes acrobatically to his right to keep the shot down, recovers and then shies at Elliott's end. Elliott makes it back again. The shot was hit hard by Ross Taylor, but Smith is so good that he anticipated it well

NEW ZEALAND:34.1 Watson to Ross Taylor, wide, full and down leg, wide called

Controlled shot thatJosh Hazlewood [7.0-2-22-0] is back into the attackAnother drinks break. This final has followed an eerily similar script to the 92 one. These two are doing a Miandad and Imran. Just need a Wasim Akram with the bat and the ball. Who will be New Zealand's Wasim Akram with bat? Corey Anderson? With ball? Trent Boult? Let's see.

NEW ZEALAND:30.6 Johnson to Elliott, 1 run, pitched up outside off, Elliott plays a drive in the air but where a cover-point would've beenSo many strokes have gone through that gully, point and backward point region in the air.

NEW ZEALAND:30.1 Johnson to Elliott, 1 run, dug in short on the stumps, Elliott rolls his wrists and pulls it through mid-wicket, for a singleMitchell Starc bowled a slew of yorkers, but Elliott seemed to have shortened his back-lift a touch to face up to Starc and dug out those yorkers quite well. Elliott then played a fine inside-out shot off James Faulkner in the 24th over for a boundary. Elliott is certainly good at essaying lofted shots through the off-side. More importantly for New Zealand, Taylor and Elliott farmed the strike well and eventually, Elliott reached a well-measured fifty. For Australia, their fielders have backed up the bowlers superbly.After losing early wickets, Grant Elliott and Ross Taylor shored up New Zealand's innings. Elliott was given out lbw off Glenn Maxwell, but he went for the review and the decision was overturned as it was missing. Australian bowlers though, kept up the intensity by bowling with good control.

NEW ZEALAND:29.4 Maxwell to Elliott, 1 run, very full on off, driven to long-off

NEW ZEALAND:27.6 Maxwell to Elliott, 1 run, the Kiwis in the crowd are up on their feet, applauding that fifty from Elliott. Who would've thought that it would be Elliott who would play the match-winning innings in a semi and now in a final get a fifty. I didn't see that coming, honestly. Gets there with a mistimed loft, was early into the shot and luckily for him it landed in front of the fielder at long-off. Elliott has a wry smile after reaching the other end

NEW ZEALAND:26.6 Watson to Elliott, 2 runs, 'oh Australia you have been brilliant in the deep' says Ian Smith with that lovely voice of his. Can't agree more. This was four all the way as Elliott slashed and got a thick outside edge, Hazlewood ran to his left from third man and dived, stopped it with one hand and kept it to two. Watson has a puzzled look on his face but that is more in frustration at how the over has gone, rather than anything else

NEW ZEALAND:26.5 Watson to Ross Taylor, wide, dug in very short and called a wide

NEW ZEALAND:24.6 Watson to Elliott, 2 runs, shortish outside off, Elliott delays the cut and sends it over the leaping Smith. Smith was airborne at backward point but the shot had too much power and he didn't even get a finger on it. Two it is as third man comes around

NEW ZEALAND:23.5 Faulkner to Elliott, 1 run, on a good length and outside off, Elliott opens the face of the bat and runs it down to third manElliott looks so calm as well. A good sign for New Zealand
NEW ZEALAND:23.4 Faulkner to Elliott, FOUR, Elliott is a confident man. Picks the slower delivery and goes over mid-off. Lofted cleanly and beats the man inside the ring. The width was there and he used it beautifully

NEW ZEALAND:22.6 Starc to Elliott, no run, on a good length and outside off, going with the angle, left alone
NEW ZEALAND:22.5 Starc to Elliott, no run, was there any words spoken there? Looked like it as Elliott dug out the yorker, pinpoint yorker from Starc, on off, Elliott dug it out and wanted to help the Aussies by picking up the ball near his feet, Warner and the man from cover race forward and pick the ball themselves. A word or two said as Elliott has a look at Warner

NEW ZEALAND:22.3 Starc to Elliott, no run, the attempted yorker on off, dug out to mid-off. The bat came down straight from Elliott that time
NEW ZEALAND:22.2 Starc to Elliott, no run, Haddin does magnificently well. Clarke pats him on the back for that effort. A bottom-edge from Elliott and Haddin, who was wrong-footed went acrobatically to his left and snaffled the take on the bounce, one-handed. That is a photographer's delight to see Haddin airborne. Anyone remember him catching Salman Butt down leg-side at Sydney in a Test?
NEW ZEALAND:22.1 Starc to Elliott, no run, short of length on off, defended with an open face to point

NEW ZEALAND:20.1 Starc to Ross Taylor, no run, short of length on the stumps, defendedMitchell Starc [4.0-0-8-1] is back into the attackIf we turn back the pages, in the 1996 World Cup Quarter-Final played in Chennai, New Zealand had found themselves in a similar position against Australia at 44 for 3, with Glenn McGrath, Damien Fleming and Paul Reiffel working well in tandem. However, Chris Harris' awe-inspiring innings of 130 lifted their sagging spirits. They certainly need someone to stand up to the challenge today too. In short, Ross Taylor has to perform on the big stage from New Zealand's perspective. After looking assured against the pacers, Martin Guptill lost his concentration and Glenn Maxwell picked up his wicket. It just shows that a part-timer can always provide a crucial breakthrough or two. Mitchell Johnson, on the other hand, bowled cross-seam. He has been successful, especially in the shorter forms of the game by using the cross-seam delivery. To make it a perfect start for Australia, Kane Williamson then just lobbed it back to the bowler, Johnson. New Zealand's batsmen seem to have been hit by a bout of nerves.
NEW ZEALAND:19.6 Maxwell to Elliott, no run, Elliott knelt down to sweep and was struck in line, missed the sweep and the ball struck him pretty low down. Dharmasena thought about it for a while and lifted his finger. Elliott and Ross Taylor had a chat and the former went for it. Reviews show that it was missing. After the decision came, Elliott and Ross Taylor punched gloves. A big moment in the gameElliott has reviewed that. He has been given out lbw by Dharmasena. Did Elliott get outside the line of off? 'Getting spin vision now Kumar. Can I get the RTS? Front on there looks like no bat Kumar. Just rock and roll that please. Keep rock and rolling it for me. No bat. Can I have the ball-tracking please? Kumar, it is missing. I will tell you to reverse this decision Kumar. I will tell you when you are on screen.' Elliott survives!

NEW ZEALAND:12.2 Johnson to Williamson, out Caught&Bowled!! Now Williamson chips one back to Johnson. Johnson points at someone in the dressing room and pumps his fist. The Aussies surround the bowler. Was it a cutter? Looked like it, on a length and on middle and off, Williamson was early into the flick and lobbed a dolly back to Mitch. He won't drop those and the nervy Williamson walks back. Australia well on top at the 'G'. Williamson c and b Johnson 12(33) [4s-1]Johnson to Williamson, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!
NEW ZEALAND:12.1 Johnson to Ross Taylor, 1 run, short of length on the hips, Ross Taylor gets inside the line to clip to fine legAfter having done all the hard work against Starc, Johnson and Hazlewood and surviving, Guptill has fallen to Maxi.

NEW ZEALAND:10.3 Johnson to Williamson, no run, that is a beauty. Rolled his fingers across the ball and the ball spits off the surface, Williamson covered the line and did all the could to defend that, but it just moved away a fraction to beat the outside edge. Johnson has a stare at Kane. Clarke has his hands on his head
NEW ZEALAND:10.2 Johnson to Williamson, no run, pushed softly to square leg
NEW ZEALAND:10.1 Johnson to Williamson, no run, dug in short down leg, Williamson got inside the line to pull and then realised he was better off not playing, pulls out of the strokeSo far this match has gone the 1992 World Cup final route. Sedate start as the bowlers are on top. Played at the same ground too. Let's see if the rest of the innings follows a similar patternHistorically, McCullum has had his problems against left-arm pacers, who have swung it with the new ball due to his lack of footwork. For instance, Zaheer Khan has dismissed him six times in ODIs. Interestingly, he has been dismissed three times lbw and once bowled by Zaheer. However, the credit has to go to Starc for bowling it full and generating enough swing to castle the dangerous McCullum. It was Martin Guptill, who soothed the nerves in the New Zealand camp with a fine cover-drive. Guptill, who has worked hard on his footwork with his mentor Martin Crowe, seems to have improved his game. New Zealand certainly need Guptill and Kane Williamson to steer them to safety.As the summit clash between Trans-Tasman rivals, Australia and New Zealand got underway, the fans were buzzing with excitement in anticipation of a riveting contest. Mitchell Starc started on a great note by swinging it in the air to knock over Brendon McCullum for a duck in the first over.

NEW ZEALAND:8.1 Johnson to Guptill, no run, Johnson comes on and hits Guptill on the glove. Dug in short and had Guptill on the hop, the ball hit glove and fell safely. Nasty first delivery from JohnsonMitchell Johnson, comes into the attack
NEW ZEALAND:7.6 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, a fine maiden over from Hazlewood, gets this to nip back in and catches Williamson on the thigh pad. The batsman failing to work it away. Practices the shot after missing
NEW ZEALAND:7.5 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, pitched up on off, Williamson gets forward and pushes it to mid-off
NEW ZEALAND:7.4 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, that is a rip-snorter from Hazlewood, Williamson was in the air as he swayed back, looking to leave, the bat was hung up like a periscope but managed to leave that in the end
NEW ZEALAND:7.3 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, now Faulkner at mid-on, dives to his right and saves some runs. It was clipped nicely by Williamson, but Faulkner was there
NEW ZEALAND:7.2 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, that one kept a bit low, on off stump, Williamson defends to cover. Adjusted well to the low bounce
NEW ZEALAND:7.1 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, Williamson doesn't look confident. Another tentative poke at a short of length delivery outside off, played outside the line and missed by a long way. Was late in covering the line too
NEW ZEALAND:6.6 Starc to Guptill, no run, very high bouncer and Haddin had to leap acrobatically to gather that. Did well as he gloved the ball. Was a bit too high but the umpires were happy with the height on that oneGuptill has gone past Sanga to move into the top of the run-getter's list in this World Cup. Starc now has 21 wickets and is joint level with Boult for the most wickets.
NEW ZEALAND:6.5 Starc to Guptill, no run, short of length outside off, Guptill lets it go
NEW ZEALAND:6.4 Starc to Guptill, no run, Mitch at mid-on does well, dives to his right and stops the flick from Guptill, saved a couple at least
NEW ZEALAND:6.3 Starc to Guptill, no run, third delivery that Starc has pushed it across Guptill, is that a set-up? Could well be. Guptill lifts his bat and lets it go as the ball was well outside off
NEW ZEALAND:6.2 Starc to Guptill, no run, another of those tempters from Starc, but this time Guptill gets forward and shoulders arms
NEW ZEALAND:6.1 Starc to Guptill, no run, that's the variation. Starc beats Guptill with a full delivery outside off, he didn't try to swing it back in, pushed it with the angle. Guptill fell for it and was lucky that he didn't edge it
NEW ZEALAND:6.1 Starc to Guptill, wide, dug in very short, Guptill sits under it and called wide
NEW ZEALAND:5.6 Hazlewood to Williamson, 2 runs, full on the pads, even though Williamson has played slightly around the front pad, he flicks it wide of Maxi at square leg, for a couple
NEW ZEALAND:5.5 Hazlewood to Guptill, 1 run, back of a length on the stumps, Guptill looks to punch and gets a thick outside edge to third man
NEW ZEALAND:5.4 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, short of length on the stumps, Guptill defends to the right of Maxi at square leg and the first call was 'wait'
NEW ZEALAND:5.3 Hazlewood to Williamson, 1 run, short of length outside off, Williamson looks to defend and gets a thick outside edge to third man, went to ground quickly
NEW ZEALAND:5.2 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, nips back in and raps Williamson on the pads. He was trying to flick and missed. The ball would've gone over as it hit Williamson high on the pad
NEW ZEALAND:5.1 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, well outside off, left alone
NEW ZEALAND:4.6 Starc to Williamson, 1 run, Williamson is off the mark, in a streaky fashion. Gets forward to drive and the square drive produces a thick outside edge, but it doesn't carry straight to the fielder at point. Wide of that fielder, Starc has a wry smile
NEW ZEALAND:4.5 Starc to Williamson, no run, that's much better. Sees the short delivery outside off and gets down quickly and then sways out of the line
NEW ZEALAND:4.4 Starc to Williamson, no run, now Starc beats with one that is close to off, Williamson pushes out with feet stuck and is beaten. Tried to pull the bat inside the line, but the ball had already gone past the edge by then
NEW ZEALAND:4.3 Starc to Williamson, no run, Williamson isn't off the mark and plays a nervy shot outside off. It was on a back of a length and outside off, rising, Williamson looked to punch with a horizontal bat and the ball flew over the edge. Was a half-hearted attempt to play which meant he was always going to miss
NEW ZEALAND:4.2 Starc to Williamson, no run, on middle and leg, pushed in front of mid-on. Played with soft hands
NEW ZEALAND:4.1 Starc to Williamson, no run, back of a length outside off, pushed wide of cover, mid-off is there too
NEW ZEALAND:3.6 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, short of length on the stumps, Guptill is early into the flick, closes the face of the bat too early and the leading edge rolls to cover. Was in the air for a while, but died down very quickly
NEW ZEALAND:3.5 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, on a good length and outside off, left alone
NEW ZEALAND:3.4 Hazlewood to Guptill, SIX, Haddin running back signals six. It was dug in short and Guptill top-edges the pull, it was a big top edge too and it carried all the way. These aren't short boundaries at the 'G' and to have carried for six shows how thick the edges of the bat are
NEW ZEALAND:3.3 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, nips back in a tad and Guptill is forward to defend, gets it off the inside half to mid-wicket
NEW ZEALAND:3.2 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, almost a collision at point between Warner and Smith. Both went for the ball in trying to field and eventually they manage to get out of each other's way. Warner manages a smile. It was short and wide outside off, Guptill mistimed the cut
NEW ZEALAND:3.1 Hazlewood to Guptill, no run, in the channel outside off, lifting too, Guptill shoulders arms. Haddin collectsJamie chirps in from the ground: The match has been sold out, but it's not a full-house as of now. Big queues outside the gates and there are some vacant spaces in the stands - as of now.
NEW ZEALAND:2.6 Starc to Guptill, 1 run, on the hips, nudged to fine leg, to retain strike
NEW ZEALAND:2.5 Starc to Guptill, no run, well played again. Dug in short at 149.4kph. Guptill sways back and then gets out of the line of that delivery. Johnson liked that and claps
NEW ZEALAND:2.4 Starc to Guptill, FOUR, Guptill will get a lot of confidence from that shot. Very full and outside off, with the angle, Guptill bends his knee a little and laces a drive to sweeper cover, two fielders give chase, but the ball wins the race
NEW ZEALAND:2.3 Starc to Guptill, no run, back of a length on the stumps, solidly defended that time to mid-off
NEW ZEALAND:2.2 Starc to Guptill, no run, short of length on the hips, Guptill rises tall and keeps it down near his legs
NEW ZEALAND:2.1 Starc to Guptill, no run, Australia ponder a review. Clarke and Haddin have a chat, decide against it. They thought it was pad first, but replays show that it was an inside edge onto the pads. The bat first as Guptill played around his front pad, in trying to flick. Shape for Starc as he brought this back in. No short leg too. Starc shook his head as he knew it was bat first
NEW ZEALAND:1.6 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, Hazlewood is getting swing early on, but Williamson is content to leave that outswinger early on. Saw it early and left it without any trouble
NEW ZEALAND:1.5 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, pitched up outside off, Williamson is solidly forward and defends to cover
NEW ZEALAND:1.4 Hazlewood to Williamson, leg byes, FOUR, second time that Hazlewood has drifted down leg this over. Williamson doesn't get bat, but gets thigh pad and it runs away to the fine leg fence
NEW ZEALAND:1.3 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, dug in short outside off, Williamson wants to spar at it and then pulls his bat inside the line, just in time. Did well not to thrust the gloves out at thatReplays show that Baz played slightly outside the line as he tried to drive. The ball was too quick and it had a nice shape back in as well. Brilliant bowling from Starc. On the big day, he has come to the party
NEW ZEALAND:1.2 Hazlewood to Williamson, no run, lovely outswinger, just inside the guideline, Williamson shoulders arms
NEW ZEALAND:1.1 Hazlewood to Guptill, 1 run, down leg, Guptill nurdles a single to fine legJosh Hazlewood, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
NEW ZEALAND:0.6 Starc to Williamson, no run, swinging down leg, Williamson fails to flick. A token appeal for lbw, but that was comfortably going downKane Williamson, right handed bat, comes to the crease
NEW ZEALAND:0.5 Starc to Brendon McCullum, out Bowled!! Gone! Got 'im! Starc has the early wicket and that too of Brendon McCullum. Superb bowling this from the left-armer. The 'G' stand up and applaud the Aussie. Starc runs with his finger pointed upwards. Inswinging fuller length delivery, nearly a yorker, but just a few inches short of that length, Brendon McCullum stood rooted to the crease and was beaten for pace. The ball cannonned into the base of off after the batsman couldn't bring his bat down in time. What a start that is for Australia. Disaster for New Zealand. Brendon McCullum b Starc 0(3)Starc to Brendon McCullum, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!
NEW ZEALAND:0.4 Starc to Brendon McCullum, no run, hello, hello! Brendon McCullum charges Starc and misses. The bowler followed McCullum as he came out of the track, but the ball went in between drive and the legs, missed leg. Good take by Haddin too. McCullum nervy early on
NEW ZEALAND:0.3 Starc to Brendon McCullum, no run, ohhh! That was so close to the off stump. Look at the cheek of Brendon McCullum, he has a wry smile at Starc who has his hands on his head. It nipped in from a fuller length and went through the drive of McCullum, the batsman was forward to play an ambitious drive and the ball nearly shaved off. A coat of paint!Right, it is Brendon McCullum vs Starc. What a battle this is! Two slips and two men right at point, close to each other. What will Baz do first up?
NEW ZEALAND:0.2 Starc to Guptill, 1 run, short of length outside off, Guptill softly dabs that wide of the diving backward point fielder, single and off the mark with that run
NEW ZEALAND:0.1 Starc to Guptill, no run, nice shape and carry through to Haddin, Guptill gets forward and sees the good length delivery outside off, it holds its line and he shoulders armsGuptill and Brendon McCullum are at the crease. Guptill is on strike. Starc will open the attackThe Aussies are out there first. McCullum and Guptill do a bit of stretching before they walk out together. The countdown begins and we are all ready to go. Game on! The biggest game of the year! Starc has the new ball. Two slips in place. Let's go then...The players are making their way out for the anthems. Oops! Just as the teams were getting ready for the anthems, an intruder ran onto the field. The security guards get rid of him quickly. New Zealand's anthem is followed by Australia's "Advance Australia Fair."Pitch report by Shane Warne: Average score here is 290. Whoever wins the toss will definitely bat first. At night the grass stands up and the quick bowlers get it to zip through. Few little cracks but it is absolutely rock-hard. Someone like a Dan Vettori may get a bit of spin.Teams:Australia (Playing XI): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, Michael Clarke(c), Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin(w), James Faulkner, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Josh HazlewoodNew Zealand (Playing XI): Brendon McCullum(c), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), Daniel Vettori, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Trent BoultNew Zealand have won the toss and have opted to batMcCullum: "It (the build-up) has been great, tremendous semi-final and it's been a great World Cup for us so far. We've earned the right now to play against the Australians in their own backyard in the final. It's going to be a great game and sure both teams will play outstanding cricket. It's a shame that one team will have to win and one team will have to lose I guess. We are going to have bat first. The wicket looks outstanding, I think give ourselves great opportunity to put the runs on the board. We've got the same team. The guys were outstanding against a very good South African team. So we've given the opportunity in the final as well. We are really happy with the way the guys are. We know we will play well today, but it doesn't guarantee us success. But we know that we will be tough to beat. We have worked on this for a long time. We know that the game has its ups and downs, so we need to remain pretty stable emotionally. The guys are excited about today and certainly not fearful. We will go out there and display our skills the best we can and hopefully they will be good enough come the end of the day. We've been very fortunate to have a lot of support from back home. Reading some of the articles, we had support from all around the world for us as well. It's going to be a great final. We are very privileged to be here and we just can't wait to get out and get amongst it."Clarke: "It's a special game. I think for both Brendon (McCullum) and I and for both the teams it is special to have made the finals. I know the Australian boys are extremely excited. It's an honour to be here and have this opportunity to try and win it. I would have batted first as well. The wicket looks fantastic so I don't think it (toss) matters too much. Same XI for us. Continue to play consistent cricket. We haven't done too much over the last couple of days. It was about recovery, making sure everybody was as fresh as possible for today. I said after the semi-final that the boys were mentally ready to go. Physically we've been able to get ourselves right and we are looking forward to today. It (support) is great. The Australian public have been so supportive. Even in the semi-final there was a lot of Indians there but the Aussies turned up and I know there are plenty at home watching on TV as well. Hopefully we can play some really good entertaining cricket for them today."It's toss time folks!Our man, Jamie at the ground has this update: "There are many fans lining up, buying souvenirs, merchandise, getting faces painted, eating snacks and such. And a lot of fans in Black Caps jerseys with New Zealand flags."The whole of New Zealand would be hoping that McCullum and Co. do it for Marty! Do it for Marty, Baz!"He seems to have really found peace with himself and the game as well, and he's been instrumental in helping some of our guys on the team peel back their games and really focus on being able to develop individually but also buy into the team collectively. So he's been a really big asset, and there are many others as well who have assisted guys individually which has helped the team collectively. So it was really sad what he's going through, and we just hope that he's able to find some peace in the time that he's got left."Asked by a reporter if he had read Crowe's letter, McCullum on Friday replied in the affirmative before speaking from the heart. "I read the article. I think he's a fantastic writer," he said. "I think what he's going through at the moment is incredibly difficult. We had him involved in the group, and not long ago as well, he came and spent time with the team and it was great."In his letter, the New Zealand great paid a touching tribute to two particular members of the Black Caps squad, terming Ross Taylor and Martin Guptill as "the two sons I never had".A pretty poignant moment on TV as Martin Crowe is seen chatting to Brendon McCullum. Just then, Martin Guptill walks in and shakes Crowe's hand. Crowe gives him a hug and suddenly becomes emotional. Crowe earlier had written a heartfelt letter to the Black Caps. Ian Smith hopes that it isn't Crowe's last game that he watches live. We all hope the same. For the uninitiated Crowe is battling with lymphoma and his health is deteriorating.Michael Clarke: "You know, tomorrow will be exactly the same as it's been every single time I've walked out onto the field to play cricket for Australia. Extremely special."Quotes: McCullum: "It's been a great ride so far. I guess this is the ultimate game for us to be able to play in everyone's theory."Weather update: No rain is predicted for today. It is a warm and sunny day and it will stay that way. So a perfect day and a perfect forecast for the World Cup final.Pre-match team news, Australia: They are likely to go in unchanged. New Zealand: Same as Australia. They too are most likely to not make any changes to their winning XIHead-to-head record: Australia lead that stat in World Cups, winning 6 and losing 3. But they lost the last game, in this World Cup at Eden Park. New Zealand haven't played at the MCG since 2012, but they won the last encounter they played against Australia in 2009. Australia, meanwhile haven't lost at the MCG since 2012, winning all their last six games."It's an exciting side. Lehmann has been working on this side for two years and put together a really good squad. When you look at the depth in this side, both with our bowling and batting, and with the allrounders, it is a strong unit. Full credit to Lehmann for that, for fostering that sort of environment and spotting talent," said the 56-year-old.In an exclusive interview former Aussie opener, Geoff Marsh believes the influence of coach Darren Lehmann has been huge in the Australian cricket team's resurgence. "From the time that Lehmann took over, the team has become a real family again," he said. "He's gone out of the way to make sure of that. He's picked the right players and they are playing for the right reason. Lehmann has brought it all together. Along with Michael, and now Smith, they've made sure that there is a terrific atmosphere in the team and that everybody has been able to relax. I think that Boof (Lehmann) has also been very big on family, making sure that players are not away for a long period of time without support. He's just been able to make players relax and enjoy their cricket, and that is massive for a coach.""I've got a wonderful group of talented and gifted players, but more importantly, I've got a team of 15 guys that have an amazing attitude and want to have success. That's what drives you every day to get out of bed and try and become better. I hope we can train well today and then go and get that reward we're after tomorrow."Michael Clarke had already said his team would have to play its best cricket to beat New Zealand, the form team of the competition. "Once we walk out onto that field, we know it's going to be an extremely tough battle and we're going to be up for that, but off the field, both teams get on really well," he said. "I think there's always that great rivalry between Australia and New Zealand. There's a great mutual respect between both teams.""Even though deep within I know that Australia start as favourites, they are a good team backed by a 90,000-strong MCG ground backing their team. Brendon McCullum has urged New Zealand fans to chime in and they are doing their bit to salvage whatever tickets that remain, but my question remains, can New Zealand win it? I can tell you this much: I will be happy if Australia win, but I will be happier if New Zealand win it."Sourav Ganguly writing exclusively on our site doesn't agree with the fact that since New Zealand are playing for the first time in Australia in the tournament, they will find it difficult. He writes: "Everyone here is saying Australia will win, and the reason they say is because New Zealand haven't played in Australia so far, which I don't agree with. They say the ball swung in New Zealand and it won't in Australia - I don't believe that either. The quality of Tim Southee and Trent Boult is much more than just conditions, and I think if they bowl in the right areas, they will get some swing and movement against Australia at the MCG. Don't forget though, that if the ball comes back into Aaron Finch and Steven Smith, who has been in outstanding form, they have been in trouble and Boult will look to do exactly that."Southee said New Zealand were not too worried about having to play at the large MCG. "We've got guys who have played a lot of cricket around the world, on big grounds, on small grounds, we've got enough experience on big grounds. A lot of the grounds in New Zealand are small but Hagley Oval is reasonably big. A lot of the guys have played in front of big crowds in India. It's going to be a great occasion, the guys are excited and we'll embrace the occasion," he said."I think that's been a strength of ours, the level-headedness that comes in the team. We don't get ahead of ourselves and we stay in the moment and just worry about the job at hand. The occasion is bigger but I'm sure the lead-up, the way we train, the way we go about it, it doesn't change from any other game," Southee said.New Zealand bowling spearhead Tim Southee reckons that the Black Caps will not be overawed by the occasion when they play Australia in the final. "We (Black Caps) would have no issues with any potential hangover from Tuesday's epic semifinal win against South Africa in Auckland. The guys enjoyed and celebrated the success and we've had to park that and move onto Sunday, and we have," he told the media.One thing is for sure, McCullum is a very clever man and also the Indian fan would surely be pleased to have received an offer from the Kiwi captain and will be certainly rooting for them after the Aussies knocked the Indians out in the semi-final. The Indians certainly don't warm up to the Aussies as much as they would do for the Kiwis. McCullum can definitely expect a lot of support from the Indians who would come to the 'G' on Sunday."I think, it's probably no secret that most of the other teams around the world would probably want New Zealand to win against Australia. So hopefully, we'll get a good smattering of support tomorrow, and I'm sure the Indian guys will certainly be rooting for us."McCullum also reached out to a billion Indian fans for support ahead of the final against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In a heart-warming letter addressed to 'every cricket fan in India', McCullum said he'd already seen a wave of support from the Indian fans already and requested their support through every ball in the final."No, we're not intimidated, I don't think," he said. "We're excited. I guess right through the week there's been a healthy sort of chat about those things externally. But from our point of view we're just going about our work in the same way. We know if we play well we'll be tough to beat, and, yeah, that's pretty much our preparation. I reckon we might have the home crowd tomorrow actually. I think it's probably no secret that most of the other teams around the world would probably fair New Zealand to win in Australia. So hopefully we'll get a good smattering of support tomorrow, and I'm sure the Indian guys will certainly be rooting for us."The MCG will test them, maybe even taunt them, never mind that McCullum, a day before the final, exuded confidence and hoped that there would be a sizeable dosage of support for his Black Caps.However, Vettori said his potential retirement should not be a distraction for New Zealand in their quest of winning their first World Cup. "It's not what I'm thinking about. It's just about having some fun and enjoying the game and enjoying the buildup to a World Cup final. No-one else in New Zealand cricket history has been able to experience that before so it's pretty exciting to experience a grand final week. The chance to play a World Cup final regardless of where you are in your career is something everyone dreams about," he stated."He's been an outstanding contributor for us. He's played for New Zealand for half his life. (A win) would be a great way to potentially send him off. I guess it was potentially his last game on home soil and for him to be out there at the end and be as instrumental and as calm as he was under pressure, it was superb. He was struggling a bit with his back, too. He's played a lot of his career with bumps and bruises and niggles and strains. He's a tough customer and he's been an amazing servant," McCullum stated.Vettori has said that Sunday's final will be his last for New Zealand. The curtains will draw for one last time. McCullum said the team would be working hard to ensure Vettori ends his career with a win.It's not only Australia who have a player playing his last ODI, New Zealand have too. The bespectacled genius. The left-arm spinner. With boyish looks. Of Italian descent. Harry Potter-esque he resembles they say. Debuted at 18. Battled injuries. Retired. Came back. Trained like hell to be fit for this. To play this World Cup. Was even coach of an Indian T20 League side. Couldn't run on the field. Didn't play for a while. Trained. Trained and trained. For one final appearance in a home World Cup. The name is Daniel Luca Vettori. And he is playing his final game on Sunday.So Australia have one more reason to be motivated come the day of the final. They would be wanting to do it for Pup. To give him the perfect send-off. With a World Cup win."I'm extremely thankful and grateful - I've just found out that tomorrow will be my 245th one-day game - it's been an honour and a privilege to represent my country for that amount of games. I'm grateful to every player I have been lucky enough to play with and this team is no exception to that. I think it is the right time for me and the Australian team. I was very fortunate four years ago to get the opportunity to captain this one-day team. That was really good preparation for me leading up to this World Cup, I think the next Australian captain deserves the same opportunity. I don't think it is realistic that I'll be fit and healthy and available to play the next World Cup so I believe it is the right time.""Tomorrow will be my last ODI game for Australia. I've just spoken to my team-mates, spoken to James Sutherland and Rod Marsh and Darren Lehmann and informed them that tomorrow will be my last ODI game for Australia."Clarke said that he made the decision after leaving the SCG on Thursday, where Australia beat India in the second semi-final by 95 runs, and told his wife Kyly upon reaching home. He hoped that retiring from ODI cricket would prolong his Test career.Lots of buildup ahead of the game. Let's focus on that now. 244 games. Debut in 2003. 7907 runs. Average 44.42. Eight hundreds. 57 fifties. One World Cup title. Still in with a chance to make it two. Countless injuries. Taken painkillers to get ready for this tournament. So many fitness issues. He battled them all for this. Just to be ready for the World Cup. The whole country fretted on his fitness. It was front-page news everywhere. Michael Clarke's stats before the big game. But he is giving up the ODI game for good. Why you may ask?Elliott was the unlikely hero as the devastated South Africans went home. Tears flowed and grown men cried. It was sport at its finest and certainly brought Eden Park to life. The 1992 heartbreak was forgotten and forgiven and the ghosts of that day laid to rest.McCullum came out a man possessed and proceeded to tear Dale Steyn apart. Steyn went for 25 in one over and New Zealand were flying. Morkel got McCullum out and that brought sanity to the proceedings. There were more twists and turns in the game until Grant Elliott - a South African by birth - nailed the final blow, hitting a six off the penultimate ball to spark unseen scenes at Eden Park.Semi-final: In the game of the tournament, New Zealand won a cliffhanger against South Africa to move into the final. South Africa were placed for the final assault after 38 overs with AB in a devastating mood. But once again rain came in to spoil their party and the game was reduced to a 43-overs per side match. South Africa made 281 and the D/L adjusted target was 298 for New Zealand.Quarter-final: Martin Guptill made the highest ever score by a batsman in a World Cup knockout game as his unbeaten 237 powered New Zealand to 393. West Indies went hell for leather and lost by 143 runs. Guptill who was dropped on 4 made the West Indies pay heavily for their mistake as the Wellington crowd were treated to his wide range of strokeplay. With the ball, Boult snared the first four wickets and set his side on their way.New Zealand: New Zealand were the only side apart from India to have a clean slate in the group stages. Played 6. Won 6. Beat Sri Lanka comfortably. Edged past Scotland. Annihilated England. Won a thriller against Australia in the game of the tournament. Eased past Afghanistan and then held their nerve to beat Bangladesh.Semi-final: Australia faced India and won a crucial toss to bat first. Warner went early but Smith and Finch rebuilt the innings. The former brought up a hundred and continued his tormenting of India. India fought back well after Smith was dismissed but a late cameo from Johnson took Australia to 329. With the runs on the board, the Aussies withstood an initial onslaught from Dhawan before taking wickets at regular intervals. Eventually they reached their seventh World Cup final with a comfortable 95-run win.Quarter-final: Pakistan were expected to be tricky opposition in the quarters but except for the tremendous spell from Wahab Riaz which had them on the ropes for a while, Australia were always in command. Once they survived Riaz's spell, Australia cantered home to victory to set up a semi-final date with India at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Road to the final, Australia: Australia began with a bang thumping England. Then there was a washout against Bangladesh before losing a thriller against New Zealand. The no-result and the loss to New Zealand meant they couldn't finish top of the group. Australia smashed Afghanistan then won a high-scoring game against Sri Lanka before having it easy against Scotland.The MCG has also played host to the 1956 Summer Olympics, the 2006 Commonwealth Games and a few of the FIFA World Cup qualifier games as well. For more about this magnificent venue, why not head over here and read this brilliant venue description: http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-series/2223/icc-cricket-world-cup-2015/venues/87/melbourne-cricket-groundThe venue for today's final is the iconic MCG. It would only be apt and fitting that the final is being played at this great venue. It can fit 100,000 and is one of the great cricketing venues in the world. The MCG is referred to as the 'Spiritual Home of Australian Sport'.As a result of this incident, the International Cricket Council (then International Cricket Conference), amended the Laws of Cricket and deemed underarm deliveries illegal. Even though this entire fiasco took place 34 years back, it galvanised a Trans-Tasman cricket rivalry, which will be at its apex today.Doing commentary for Channel 9 at that time, Richie Benaud, the legendary Australian captain, described it as disgraceful and one of the worst things that he has seen on the cricket field. To add to that, Ian Chappell, former Australian captain himself and the older brother of Greg and Trevor, was not too pleased with his brother's action either. He was heard saying, "No, Greg, no, you can't do that" in the commentary box.Greg Chappell's step created a lot of furore and was condemned all over. Bowling underarm was legal at that point of time, but was considered against the spirit of the game. The incident drew widespread criticism from all quarters, including the then Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and New Zealand's Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, who described the incident as "the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket".The Trans-Tasman rivalry took on a whole new meaning after the 1981 Benson and Hedges World Series Cup, third final at the MCG. New Zealand needed 6 off the final ball to tie the game. Trevor Chappell was the bowler. What happened next became one of the biggest controversies in cricket's history. Greg Chappell, the Australian captain and Trevor's older brother, instructs his bowler/brother, to roll the final delivery under-arm.The term Trans-Tasman is used for the inter-relations between both Australia and New Zealand, since the two countries are geographically separated by the Tasman Sea.Since Australia and New Zealand are playing, it will only be apt to focus on the Trans-Tasman rivalry a bit. It may not be competing with the likes of India-Pakistan or Australia-England, but the Trans-Tasman rivalry has a history and a past attached to it as well. So, why is it known as the Trans-Tasman rivalry?Drumroll please! A great day to everyone tuning in here. We welcome you all for one final time in this World Cup. One final effort. One final coverage. One prize and the grandest of them all is up for grabs. So sit back and enjoy the fun ride. We are just getting started and there is still a long way to go. Make yourself comfortable as we dig in deep to bring you Australia vs New Zealand - battling for the World Cup at the 'G'.Six semi-final heartbreaks before this edition. A country of just 4.5 million. The widely held view and it's a joke - there are more sheep than people in the country. Heck, New Zealand's population is well less than that of Bangalore - a city in India. Still they punch above their weight in every cricketing contest. There was heartbreak in 1992 in front of their own crowd at Eden Park. The time has come to rewrite history. Now is the time. It will be the "greatest time of their lives" if McCullum and Co. can pull it off.The big brother vs small brother. The little brother from across the ditch. Australia vs New Zealand. One has won four World Cups. The other none. One an all-time great World Cup outfit. The other trying to carve their own name on the trophy. Australia the favorites always against their kid brothers. So many perceptions. So many subplots. So many stories. So many sidelights. You can add your own stuff here....West Indies and Clive Lloyd. West Indies and Clive Lloyd. India and Kapil Dev. Australia and Allan Border. Pakistan and Imran Khan. Sri Lanka and Arjuna Ranatunga. Australia and Steve Waugh. Australia and Ricky Ponting. Australia and Ricky Ponting. India and MS Dhoni. Will it be Australia and Michael Clarke or New Zealand and Brendon McCullum who will be added to that list on Sunday?This is the "greatest time of our lives" as Brendon McCullum put it. The greatest time of their lives for the 22 players who will step out onto the 'G' on Sunday. The greatest time for the rest of their contingent as well. The greatest occasion. The greatest prize on offer. The chance to become great for ever. Greatness beckons. Greatness to be taken in and packed home for posterity. Greatness is available and for sale when 22 players walk out to play the final.A chance for 22 players from both countries to give it their very best and emerge victorious. Only 11 will be happy. The other 11 will be distraught. 11 will rejoice. 11 will be heart-broken. 11 will hope that tomorrow never comes. 11 will want tomorrow to come like no other day. 11 will be in dreamland. 11 will be in despair. 11 will be heroes for life. 11 will be left villains at least for a day.It doesn't get bigger or better or grander or greater than this. This is the greatest moment for some. And for some more as well.This is it! This is the World Cup final!Australia's power vs New Zealand's intelligence. Home advantage vs Red-hot streak. 5-match winning streak vs 10-match unbeaten run. Clash of styles. Clash of different strategies. The audacity of Maxwell vs the guile of Vettori. The daredevilry of McCullum vs the calmness of Smith. The serenity of Kane vs the class of Clarke. Left-armer vs Left-armer. The swing of Southee vs the talent of Hazlewood. Australia's fielding vs New Zealand's fielding. No quarter asked for. None given. The winner takes it all. The last man standing. It's on. Game on!Brendon McCullum vs Michael Clarke. Both inspirational leaders. Both pro-active skippers. Both lead from the front. Both set an example to others. Both put their team above themselves. Both are two of the finest captains in the World at the moment. Both extrovert characters. Both looking to crown themselves in glory.Centuries - check. Double-centuries - check. Four-fors - check. Five-fors - check. Hat-tricks - check. Dropped catches - check. Sitters - check. Astounding catches - check. Stunning grabs - check. Passion - check. Nerves - check. Great clashes - check. One-sided thrashings - check. Greatness - check. Mediocrity - check. Nerveless endings - check. Retirements - check. Legends taking a bow - check. We've seen it all. There is just one more final hurrah left. One last game. The final frontier. The last chance saloon. I say, lets bring it on!12:00 Local Time, 01:00 GMT, 06:30 IST: This is it! 14 teams. 44 days. 210 players. Coaching staff. Physical trainers. Data analysts. Computer analysts. Nutrition consultants. Mentors. Motivational speakers. So forth and so on. Everything comes to a stop here. This is what one plays for. This is the ultimate. This is the grandest prize. This is what everyone yearns for. This is the dream. This is the crowning glory. A sportsperson's greatest moment.Preview by G RajaramanJust another game? Australia and New Zealand may get to the park on Sunday with preparation to suggest that they would be approaching their newest battle as just another game. But they need no reminding that this time, unlike in any of their 126 ODI earlier meetings, there is a little reward that awaits the winners ? the ICC Cricket World Cup, no less.On Saturday, the co-hosts prepared for the big day like they would for any other game, not wanting the occasion or the venue to leave them awe-struck. New Zealand paid attention to detail with bowling coach Shane Bond spending time surveying the expansive outfield from a bowler's perspective. Australia turned up in full force on a day of optional practice.The absence of needle, with the teams not being at loggerheads, and the presence of enormous respect for one another's combative skills should not be misconstrued as a lack of intent on either side. They are both capable of launching spectacular assaults, with their captains unwilling to take their feet off the pedal.The teams are equally hungry. They are blessed with explosive batsmen and others who can ensure that the power hitters come in at the appropriate times; they have quality fast bowlers and are terrific fielding sides; New Zealand have cricket's shrewdest left-arm spinner, Daniel Vettori to support pace bowlers while Australia rely on Glenn Maxwell to fill up as fifth bowler.Given that, it will be tempting to sit on the wall and say that the team which plays the better cricket on Sunday will emerge the winner of the World Cup. But while one should not write off McCullum's New Zealand ? especially because of his sharp captaincy ? they will find it tough to slip past the home team.Of course, New Zealand are the only unbeaten squad in the World Cup so far, playing an attacking brand of cricket. What's more, they are the only side that has inflicted a defeat on the world's top ODI team in the World Cup, a thrilling one-wicket victory in a Group A league game in Auckland. But that match was all about great bowling, swing, seam and fast.The MCG deck is the sort which demands great discipline from the batsmen and greater discipline from the bowlers. Australia, who have constantly summoned World Cup winning legends like Steve Waugh and Adam Gilchrist to chat with the team, can be expected to use their knowledge of MCG to keep their nose ahead of the Black Caps.New Zealand have not an ODI played in Australia in five years but they will remember that the last time a Black Caps team beat the home side, the game had been played at MCG. As many as seven players in the current squad were part of that team that made light of the fact they were playing on a larger ground than any in their own nation.Yet, if Australia have been installed as favourites and New Zealand been labelled the underdogs, it is only because the Black Caps have played all their eight World Cup games so far at home. It is the first time they have flown into Australia. How well they adapt to that challenge will determine if they can continue punching like they have done so far.For all that, if the teams dish out a high quality contest in keeping with the stature of the World Cup final, fans around the globe will add more memories to add to the rich collection from limited-over cricket's biggest event. Australia and New Zealand have the potential to ensure that fans do not remember the game as just another ODI game.Umpires: Kumar Dharmasena (Sri Lanka) and Richard Kettleborough (England).
