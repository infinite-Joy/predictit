Gambhir is on strike. Mills will open the attackWill the young Indian team chase this mighty total? Or will the Kiwi bowlers get the better of the batsmen? The players are walking out, welcome back.NZ have finally had an excellent day with the bat after struggling for most parts of this series. Brendon McCullum and Guptill got the team off to a flier as they maintained a very healthy run rate. However, the Indian spinners kept things tight in the middle overs, but NZ upped the ante in the Batting PP as they scored runs at will. Franklin was extremely unlucky to miss out on a well deserved century and finished up on an unbeaten 98. Thanks to his efforts, NZ finished up on a mammoth 315/7. The Indian batting order will be finally tested and it will be interesting to see how they respond. Join us at 06:40 PM IST for the Indian run chase...4

Brendon has great memories of this wicket and Ross knows a thing or two about the conditions here. The guys have worked hard and hope the result goes our way today. Jamie How comes back, Williamson and Hopkins miss out.Gambhir: We have been chasing pretty well and the bowlers have been doing good, so we would like to go out there and get everything right. We have got 3 changes. Parthiv, Saurabh and Praveen Kumar are playing today. Vijay, Ravindra Jadeja and Munaf miss out.India have won the toss and elected to fieldIt was the 18th of April 2008, the first game of the 1st season of the IPL and one man, Brendon McCullum, took the bowlers apart with a blistering knock of 158. With Baz opening for the Kiwis today, will we see some fireworks from him?Pitch report: There was some nice green grass cover on this wicket which has been shaved today. There is slightly humid, the ball will swing around. The Kiwis will take some early wickets if they bowl first. As far as the Indians are concerned, they would bat first looking at the average scores on this ground. The outfield looks nice and fast, we are in for a good game feels Simon Doull.Simon Doull: McCullum will keep wickets today, Southee will come back. Williamson and Hopkins won't play. The Kiwis will hope that the changes work in their favour. They would look to win the toss and bat first, the wicket looks good, it might have a little more pace on it than the previous games. Ross Taylor has played a lot of games here, he plays for the Royal Challengers Bangalore, and he can't ask for a better place to get back to scoring ways. The Kiwis are down in confidence, and may be the inspiration is Ross Taylor.Ross Taylor plays for the Royal Challengers Bangalore and it won't be wrong to say, he'll be playing in his home ground. And knowing the Bangalore crowd, Ross Taylor is sure to get some support from the 40,000 odd people at the Chinnaswamy Stadium.# Virat Kohli needs 66 more runs to become the highest run scorer in this calender year.Hello and welcome to all the cricket lovers. We are in the Garden City, Bengaluru, for the 4th ODI of this five match series. The Indians have been impeccable thus far; with key players rested and with the youngsters stepping up, the Indians are undoubtedly on cloud nine. The Kiwis, on the other hand, have a lot to play for, they need to get their confidence back and show the world that they are more than capable of competing with a side like India.The Indians have a made a couple of changes to their squad for the next two ODIs. Parthiv Patel, is playing an ODI after more than 6 years while Saurabh Tiwary may get an eye in after sitting on the bench for the first three ODIs. Talking about the weather, there are scattered clouds but no threats of thunderstorms.This is Ajith and I will take you through the day along with Shashank and Sid V. Stay tuned, we'll be back with more updates...by Vishaal LoganathanThe series so far has turned out to be a grossly mismatched affair with India coming out victors in all three matches. The result may not be surprising to many, but the manner in which the New Zealand team succumbed to defeats in the ODIs may well be.India lead 3-0 and have already got their hands on the trophy, it will be an ideal time for them to put to test the many youngsters they have brought in for this tourney; while New Zealand will want to get a win under their belt and look forward to the next ODI and the home series against Pakistan.IndiaWith the important tour to South Africa and the World Cup coming up, the form of the Indian team couldn't be more refreshing. Team India's performance even without most of their match winners bodes well for the team and they will ensure they do not take their foot off the pedal and put NZ to the sword with another efficient performance.The form of the top order looks superb, with both Gambhir and Virat Kohli looking rock steady at the top. Gautam Gambhir has two unbeaten centuries to his name in the tournament whereas Kohli has scored more than 50 in all 3 matches. They will be looking to kick off from where they stopped in the last match.Murali Vijay has disappointed with sub-par scores but he has forged a good opening partnership with Gambhir and has held fort at one end to help India off to good starts so far in the series. The middle order hasn't had much to do in the series considering the stellar form of the two Delhi batsmen up front, so a reshuffle in the battling line up is likely to give the likes of Yuvraj Singh and Yusuf Pathan a hit in the middle.India's bowling has been good in this series and the return of spearhead Zaheer Khan has given the team a massive boost. R Ashwin too has impressed with his variety and ability to keep the batsmen locked down in the powerplay overs.New ZealandNew Zealand's tour started off on a bright note when they almost pulled off a stunning win in the first Test. The rest of the tour since then has started to steadily decline for them. They were saved in the second Test thanks to a brilliant double hundred by Brendon McCullum and have tasted defeat 4 times since (the 3rd Test and the 3 ODIs).The Kiwis will have to turn up a more determined unit and look to kick their losing habit. Their ODI form has taken a battering and they will want to give their camp something to smile about in the last 2 ODIs before returning home.Their batting has been woeful through the ODI series and much will depend upon Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor if they are to put up a fight and entertain thoughts of clinching a win. James Franklin has a good outing with the bat in the last ODI, and he will be hoping to continue in the same way as NZ desperately look for an all-rounder to replace the injured Jacob Oram.Their bowling has been nothing to write home about either with Andy McKay the only bowler to have gotten amongst the wickets. Vettori is once again expected to play a key role in restricting the Indian batsmen in the middle overs.India definitely look favourites to clinch the match in Bangalore and extend their dominance over the surprisingly lack-lustre New Zealand team, while New Zealand will desperately look to draw inspiration from somewhere to bring more respectability to their form and the series score line. They have the firepower with the likes of Dan Vettori, Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor in the line up, but the team has to ensure they play out of their skins to win against the rampaging Indian team.Teams:India (From): Gautam Gambhir(c), Parthiv Patel(w), Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Saurabh Tiwary, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Murali Vijay, Ravindra Jadeja, Ashish NehraNew Zealand (From): Brendon McCullum(w), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Kane Williamson, Scott Styris, Grant Elliott, James Franklin, Daniel Vettori(c), Nathan McCullum, Kyle Mills, Andy McKay, Tim Southee, Gareth Hopkins, Jamie HowLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
