AUSTRALIA:5.2 Finn to Forrest, out Lbw!! Another plumb lbw and Australia slip. This was pitched on a length outside off and nips back in slightly, Forrest was caught in his crease as he looked to defend and was rapped on the back-pad in front of off, the ball was going on to crash into middle. Forrest had a word or two with Watson before trudging off. Finn has 2 in 2. Forrest lbw b Finn 0(1) Finn to Forrest, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Forrest has been given out LBW, will he review? No, he is a gonerPeter Forrest, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:5.1  Finn to Warner, out Lbw!! This was as plumb as it gets. Finn bowled this one full and on the middle, Warner was looking to tuck it towards the onside and misses, the ball struck him low on the pads in front of middle and would have crashed into the middle of middle. Llong has to change his decision, Warner's miserable stay ends. Warner lbw b Finn 2(19) Finn to Warner, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Loud appeal for LBW, will England ask for a review? Yes, a review called. It looks very close to the naked eye, does not look like Warner got any bat on that. 3 REDS, Warner is OUT

Shane Watson is on strike. Anderson will open the attackWe're set for the start. The conditions are a bit overcast and it's no surprise that England asked Australia to bat first.

The hosts lead the series 2-0 (the 3rd match was washed out) and will look to seal the series today. Australia, on the other hand, battle for survival (which doesn't happen too often). Stay tuned for the toss and other updates..Match PreviewAustralia have been outplayed by the hosts England in the ODI series so far. The visitors might have harbored hopes of making a winning start, but the 3rd ODI was rained off. The best they can do is to square the series, but it looks difficult against a compact England side. Knowing Australia's hunger and ability to bounce back, the 4th ODI at Chester-Le-Street should be an interesting one. EnglandEngland have played excellent cricket right from the start of the season. They gave practically nothing away to the West Indies in the 2-0 series victory and they seem to be continuing in the same vein against Australia. The bowlers have done a brilliant job, restricting the strong-on-paper Australian batting to par or below par scores in the first 2 ODIs. The batting has looked solid as well, with the top order trio of Alastair Cook, Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott in good form. The team management will be happy with Ravi Bopara after he scored a match-winning half century in the second ODI. Eoin Morgan displayed his finishing skills at Lords and announced his return to form. Although Graeme Swann has been ruled out of the last 2 ODIs, the team will not miss him that much as the fast bowlers seem to be doing a great job. The pick among the bowlers have been Tim Bresnan and Stuart Broad. Expect nothing short of a strong showing once again in the 4th ODI as well. AustraliaComing off a long break after the tour to West Indies, the Australians have looked rusty. Though the batting has clicked to an extent, the middle order clearly misses the towering and calming presence of a certain Michael Hussey. David Warner, George Bailey and skipper Michael Clarke have shown glimpses of good strokeplay, but it has not been enough to make the England bowlers uncomfortable. David Hussey's failure to play the dasher's role in the batting powerplay and finishing overs has cost them a few runs which has ultimately led to a collapse in the later overs. As far as the bowlers are concerned, they have lacked the penetration against a quality England batting line-up. It will be a true test of Clarke's captaincy to see how he can motivate this side to at least square the series.
