PAKISTAN:20.5 20.5 Roach to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, Pakistan are through to the semi-finals. Mark Nicholas sums it up beautifully: A devastating performance from Pakistan and one of the great World Cup wins of all time. As Kamran Akmal has done all evening, he stands tall and crashes into the gap past cover, it races away, Kamran Akmal and Hafeez hug each other and all the beautiful Bongs in the crowd who are supporting Pakistan clear their throats. Revenge for that game they lost against West Indies? Eh? Whatever it is, only one team arrived here and they will now travel to India (Mohali) for the first time in this World Cup to face the winner of India v Australia tomorrow in the semis.

PAKISTAN:19.6  Rampaul to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, Kamran Akmal is clearly chuffed after playing that shot, a short arm jabbed pull, got inside the line of that leg stumpish delivery and pulled it away in style, deep fine leg had no chance, Kamran Akmal grins from ear to ear, showing all his teeth which are shining under the Mirpur flood-lights

PAKISTAN:18.4  Roach to Kamran Akmal, no run, that has pinged Kamran Akmal on the elbow, he was early on the pull, it was the slower bouncer, Sammy likes it, Kamran Akmal is in pain, but he isn't going anywhere, he wants to be there when they win this

PAKISTAN:18.1  Roach to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, a top edged pull, the pacy short of length delivery caught Kamran Akmal by surprise, but the extra pace of Roach meant that it took the top edge and went over the keeper's head, a boundary to Kamran Akmal and Pakistan need just 14 moreTime for Drinks. Meanwhile, here Realtime Thiru has joined me. He is bracing up for the big one tomorrow - India v Australia. The first quarter-final has been a big let-down. Only one side have turned up both physically and mentally for this game. Pakistan have absolutely devastated the Windies with a brilliant performance. Realtime's prediction for tomorrow: A Sachin ton, his 100th international ton and a victory for the Indians. He says that India will chase and win against Australia. We will see whether his prediction comes true. Meanwhile, we have the small matter of finishing this game off. The players are back on the field and we are all set to continue.

Here is another gem: As Kamran Akmal played that shot, he says this:' a backfoot push off the back.'

Akmal is on strike. Roach will open the attackAlright, more on the state of West Indies' cricket for another day. We are all set for the Pakistani chase despite a floodlight issue which has been sorted out in time - otherwise we might have had to come and complete the game tomorrow. A huddle from the West Indies, a small one too. The Pakistani openers are out there. Roach with the new ball. 2 slips await in anticipation. If West Indies are to have any chance, Roach needs to bowl the spell of his life.Sunny G and Tony Greig in the post innings show were lamenting about the fact that how the mighty Windies have fallen. Though it is sad to see them playing so badly, to be honest they are in steep decline. For some players, a lucrative career in T20Is all around the world means so much rather than playing for the West Indies. That's how it is and that's how it will remain for a while, unless a strong personality like a Clive Lloyd or a Sir Viv Richards takes over there.A funny placard with lots of spelling errors in the crowd after Afridi took his 4th wicket and ended the West Indian innings: 'Bhoom Bhoom Afradi, welcome to Bangladesh!' Terrific performance from the Pakistanis though it must be said. Mesmeric bowling, inspirational captaincy and most importantly playing as a team after a long time. It's all the more sweet for this performance has come on their National Day - which is today. Lots of support in the crowd for Pakistan, and once again I reiterate this - the Bangladeshis are firmly rooting for them and they have every reason to after seeing their side crash to one of their shocking losses in ODIs to the men from the Caribbean.History repeating itself?: Shiv Chanderpaul must have felt a sense of deja-vu for he was the only one who played in the game against Kenya in the 1996 World Cup when he top-scored with 19 as his side slumped to 93 all-out en-route to a shocking loss against the amateurs Kenya. Here he is again top-scoring and remaining unbeaten on 44 as all the others around him left in a tame fashion.Afridi's variations were deceptive, while Ajmal's doosras were a mystery to the West Indians who could not pick either. Only Chanderpaul put in stoic resistance and that too he was brought in only for this game. Roach's batting should prove to be a lesson to the other members in the side (especially for someone like a Pollard who considers playing T20Is all over the world as the holy grail), he presented the full face of the bat and knuckled down to add some useful runs along with Chanderpaul to get them past their lowest score in World Cups - which was 93 against Kenya in 1996.Mark Nicholas put it in the best way possible when he described Pakistan's performance today; here are his exact words: "For a nation that does not play test cricket at home, for a nation that has been beset by so many problems, to see this has been absolutely mesmeric". One can't put it more brilliantly and succinctly than that. Right from the time, Gayle's thumping drive couldn't clear mid off, it was Pakistan all the way. They had the West Indies in all sorts of trouble and once Sarwan got out, just when he was beginning to look good, the flood-gates opened.Hafeez: The plan was made yesterday, I was asked to bowl nice and straight with the new ball and not give any width to Gayle. The management gave me the plan and showed the confidence in me. The coach and the team management are working hard and it is paying off. We wanted to get them out as quickly as possible, now that we have done that, we would want to chase it down quickly.4
WEST INDIES:43.3  Afridi to Rampaul, out Bowled!! It is THE END for the West Indies batsmen and I'm afraid, it may be the end of their World Cup campaign too, wonderfully bowled googly from Afridi, landed it outside leg, Rampaul was looking to paddle it fine, turns across and finds the leg stump, 'Well bowled' says umpire Steve Davies to the Pakistani captain, he has taken 4 wickets, the 4th time he has done so in this World Cup.

WEST INDIES:16.3  Afridi to Sarwan, no run, Sarwan charged down the track, Afridi spots it and fires in the quicker delivery, it skids straight on, Sarwan gets the bat close to the pad, the ball hits the pad first, Afridi went up for the review, but the impact was just outside the line of off stump, the ball would have hit middle and off and the batsman was more than 2.5 meters out of his crease when he jumped out.Afridi has opted for the review here. He appealed for an LBW and Sarwan charged down the track, to the naked eye, it looked not out, but you never know.
WEST INDIES:16.2  Afridi to Sarwan, no run, looped up, straightens a bit on the off stump, Sarwan defends it to the off side
WEST INDIES:16.1  Afridi to Sarwan, no run, starts off with a flatter delivery, but he strays it on the middle and leg stump, Sarwan tries to tuck it to the leg side, but the ball hits him high on the thigh guardShahid Afridi, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackTime for me (Srivathsa) to take a breather.

WEST INDIES:15.1  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, Chanderpaul comes down the track and works it to short mid wicketDrinks are on the field now Sir Ian has this interesting snippet about the free-hit on air: Nick Knight once left a free hit alone. Tony Cozier responds wittily: Then maybe it is a non free-hitTime for drinks as well on a hot and humid day. The Pakistanis have choked the West Indian innings. Superb bowling from Hafeez who has been quite a revelation bowling with the new ball. Good support from Gul and Riaz so far. Both the Guyanese boys - Sarwan and Chanderpaul are at the crease. They are the ideal men from a West Indian view-point to be batting at the crease. Both will take their time and then slowly rebuild. Still the power-hitters in Pollard, Sammy and Co. to come. So West Indies need some rebuilding to do.
WEST INDIES:14.6  Riaz to Sarwan, no run, nice looking drive from Sarwan, off drive, but finds Afridi at mid off

WEST INDIES:14.5  Riaz to Sarwan, wide, way outside off and a wide called
WEST INDIES:14.4  Riaz to Chanderpaul, 1 run, Chanderpaul backs away too early, moved to leg to crash it through the off side, Riaz saw that and fired it full and wide outside off, in the end, Chanderpaul had to reach out and the toe ender could only bring him a single
WEST INDIES:14.4  Riaz to Sarwan, no ball, 1 run, the first no-ball of the game and a big no-ball too, Riaz is striving for extra pace, the ball had pace on that, it thudded into Sarwan's bat and the inside nick hit the pads and went down to third man, free hit time, Sarwan and Chanderpaul have a chat, Afridi and Co. make some field changes, remember that the field can change for the strike rotated
WEST INDIES:14.3  Riaz to Sarwan, no run, short of length and on middle, Sarwan taps it near his feet
WEST INDIES:14.2  Riaz to Sarwan, no run, full ball and coming back in with the angle from round the wicket, Sarwan tries to drive with a closed face, but no timing and the ball dribbles to mid on

WEST INDIES:13.2  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, gets forward and pushes it softly
WEST INDIES:13.1  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, Chanderpaul was initially looking to come forward and play it through cover, then went back and defends

WEST INDIES:12.6  Riaz to Sarwan, wide, comes round the wicket and slips down leg, wide called
WEST INDIES:12.5  Riaz to Sarwan, FOUR!!, genuine Sarwan says Tony Cozier and I agree, not a half volley, but angled across Sarwan on a fuller length outside off, Sarwan leant on it and drove it beautifully with sweet timing past cover, went racing away on the slow outfield, that should help Sarwan's confidence
WEST INDIES:12.4  Riaz to Sarwan, no run, full ball on off, Sarwan gets forward and drives it straight to the fielder at mid off
WEST INDIES:12.3  Riaz to Sarwan, FOUR!!, pressure release, first boundary in 10 overs shuffled across to leg, gently glanced it past the fine leg man who was very square
WEST INDIES:12.2  Riaz to Chanderpaul, 1 run, flicked in the air where a short mid wicket would've been, but there is no one there and a single to be had
WEST INDIES:12.1  Riaz to Chanderpaul, no run, short of length delivery on off stump, Chanderpaul gets right behind the line to defend, played solidlyTony Cozier, a legend in cricket broadcasting and who has an Elephant's memory has this suggestion to the West Indian batsmen: 'Play Hafeez as a leggie, he is drifting the ball in to the batsmen all the time.'
WEST INDIES:11.6  Hafeez to Sarwan, no run, went on the backfoot and worked it to the right of Hafeez
WEST INDIES:11.5  Hafeez to Sarwan, no run, Sarwan plonks his front-foot and pushes this to short cover

WEST INDIES:11.3  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, much better, Chanderpaul comes on the frontfoot and blocks solidly
WEST INDIES:11.2  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, Chanderpaul is playing outside the line of the ball and once again a fat inside edge onto the pads saves him

WEST INDIES:10.6  Riaz to Chanderpaul, no run, short of length delivery, rising outside off, Chanderpaul stands tall and pats it with soft hands to the off sid
WEST INDIES:10.5  Riaz to Sarwan, 1 run, lots of confusion, lots of screaming too, it was flicked wide of mid on, there was a direct hit at the non-striker's end, but Sarwan had made it comfortably, he wanted the extra run off the richochet, but his Guyanese team-mate Chanderpaul was firm and rejected it, Afridi running after the ball has a few words to say to his mates as wellBilly is having a look at the ball. It's fine. Sarwan mean-while has a change of willow.

It is to be expected from the Bongs for the West Indies inflicted a humiliating defeat on the home side. Credit though to the Pakistanis for bowling superbly, especially from the Professor - Hafeez - he is nick-named the Professor by his team-mates for the way he analyses the game
WEST INDIES:9.6  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, Chanderpaul closed the face on that a tad too early, but the soft leading edge went to ground quickly
WEST INDIES:9.5  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, flat, full delivery outside off, Chanderpaul with an open face to short third

WEST INDIES:9.1  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, Chanderpaul was again late on the ball as Smith and Darren Bravo were, but though he played slightly outside the line of the ball, he inside edged it to square leg, if he had missed, he might have been in mighty trouble

WEST INDIES:7.3  Hafeez to Sarwan, 1 run, softly tapped wide of Afridi at short mid for an easy single
WEST INDIES:7.2  Hafeez to Sarwan, no run, Sarwan gets forward and defends
WEST INDIES:7.1  Hafeez to Sarwan, no run, Sarwan's foot didn't move an inch out of the crease, lovely bowling from Hafeez though, beating the outside edge of the bat with a drifter, Kamran did well, but Sarwan was well inKamran Akmal has whipped off the bails in a flash and that forces Billy Bowden to go for the review. Not-out.
WEST INDIES:6.6  Gul to Chanderpaul, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, Chanderpaul gets right behind the line to block
WEST INDIES:6.5  Gul to Chanderpaul, no run, bouncer, but it does not threaten Chanderpaul for it is outside off and secondly the slow track deadens the impact of that delivery, Chanderpaul sways out of the line with no trouble at all
WEST INDIES:6.4  Gul to Chanderpaul, no run, good ball, it was aimed at the toes, a foot short of the block-hole, Chanderpaul clips it in his own trade-mark style with a shuffle to square leg

WEST INDIES:5.6  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, drifting down leg, clipped straight to the fielder at short fine, end of quite an eventful over
WEST INDIES:5.5  Hafeez to Chanderpaul, no run, that's how you play, with the bat in front of the pad, Chanderpaul uses all his skill, experience and method to block it backShivnarine Chanderpaul, left handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:5.4  Hafeez to Darren Bravo, out Lbw!! You just can't plonk your front-foot forward and hope to get away without using your bat. That's the price modern batsmen have to pay with the UDRS in place. The fast flattish arm ball from Hafeez, landed on middle, drifted in, Darren Bravo was hit low on the pad, though the ball was just clipping the outside of leg, the original decision stays. Steve Davis as he did for the first LBW decision, gave it out within a blink of an eye. West Indian innings already in a shambles. Darren Bravo lbw b Hafeez 0(3) Hafeez to Darren Bravo, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Review time: Darren Bravo has been given out. Steve Davis again. Darren Bravo after having a word with Sarwan takes the review, he has to go after replays vindicated the ump's decision. Pakistan on fire.
WEST INDIES:5.3  Hafeez to Darren Bravo, no run, Darren Bravo pushes it back to Hafeez from the crease
WEST INDIES:5.2  Hafeez to Darren Bravo, no run, Oh! Darren Bravo was late on the backfoot defensive, he mis-judged the length, but in the end he kept it out, but dangerous stuffDarren Bravo, left handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:5.1  Hafeez to Smith, out Lbw!! Second gone. The skidding delivery from Hafeez, from round the wicket, pitches on off and hurries off the track, Smith is ages late on the defensive shot, it came back in and hit Smith on the back pad, Steve Davis gives it out straightaway and Smith, I'm assuming walked off. That would've crashed into off and middle. Wise from Smith no to take the review. Smith lbw b Hafeez 7(14) [4s-1] Hafeez to Smith, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Back to the normal nuisance - Smith has been given out, but we don't know whether he has opted for the review since the official broadcasters have cut to their stupid ads.
WEST INDIES:4.6  Gul to Sarwan, no run, fullish on off stump, Sarwan comes on the frontfoot and drives with no timing to mid off
WEST INDIES:4.5  Gul to Sarwan, no run, in the channel outside off, left alone
WEST INDIES:4.4  Gul to Sarwan, no run, huge shout for caught behind, but there was day-light between bat and ball, short and wide outside off, Sarwan missed out on the cut, the ball missed the bat too, Pakistanis were confident that it there was some deviation off the bat, but not so confident to take the review
WEST INDIES:4.3  Gul to Sarwan, no run, fullish and a hint of in-ward movement, Sarwan plonks his front-foot forward and pushes it back to Gul, made sure that he did not leave a gap between bat and pad
WEST INDIES:4.2  Gul to Sarwan, no run, in the corridor of uncertainty, outside off, Sarwan shoulders arms
WEST INDIES:4.1  Gul to Smith, 1 run, cut hard into the ground, Umar Akmal fumbles at point, allows a singleGayle let out a grimace after he found the fielder. He was unhappy that he hit it straight to the fielder. Gul was pumping his fist and clearly chuffed that it found the man, instead of the gap. It swerved away from Afridi and kept his eye on it till the last moment to pouch it. A crucial catch too.
WEST INDIES:3.6  Hafeez to Sarwan, no run, tossed up delivery on off, Sarwan gets forward and defends
WEST INDIES:3.5  Hafeez to Sarwan, no run, glanced down to short fineSlight delay in play after a bail is broken. Ramiz Rambo with his first gem of the day after that incident: It is not Billy Bowden has broken it, he possesses a lot of muscle, but I promise you it is not him who has broken it. Ha there you go Rambo boy!
WEST INDIES:3.4  Hafeez to Smith, 1 run, sharp single taken, the bottom-handed closed face coming into play as Smith tried to drive it past cover, mid on was deep and an easy single taken in the end
WEST INDIES:3.3  Hafeez to Smith, no run, punched back to Hafeez
WEST INDIES:3.2  Hafeez to Smith, no run, short of length delivery on the middle and leg, Smith goes on the backfoot to tuck it to leg and misses, was going down though
WEST INDIES:3.1  Hafeez to Smith, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, Smith taps it to the off side
WEST INDIES:2.6  Gul to Sarwan, no run, good first ball that from Gul, he is clearly fired up after that wicket, pitched on off and seamed back in, Sarwan shoulders arms and that was not far away from the off stumpR Sarwan, right handed bat, comes to the crease
WEST INDIES:2.5  Gul to Gayle, out Caught by Afridi!! Past team-mates or not, it does not matter. This is nation vs nation and Gul is jumping all over the place after getting Gayle out. Gayle went for an encore and perished. Skipped down the track, slammed it fiercely too, but straight to Boom Boom at mid off. An easy catch though it was travelling fast. Taken with fingers pointing up. The Pakistanis and the Bongs in the crowd who are rooting for them go mad. A monster of a wicket that is. The King from Jamaica makes the long walk back. Gayle c Afridi b Gul 8(9) [4s-2] Gul to Gayle, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
WEST INDIES:2.4  Gul to Gayle, no run, superb come-back, yorker bang on off stump, Gayle crouches low and digs it out, he was late on the shot, but kept it out
WEST INDIES:2.3  Gul to Gayle, FOUR!!, Gayle would've faced a lot of Gul in the nets - wondering how - Gayle and Gul were team-mates at KKR - at least in the first season. That would've helped Gayle to some extent as he comes down the track and launches this length ball up and over mid off, Gayle made soom room to hit it powerfully
WEST INDIES:2.2  Gul to Smith, 1 run, Smith goes on the backfoot and taps it wide of short mid, easy single as Gayle ambles along to the other end
WEST INDIES:2.1  Gul to Smith, no run, Smith was in two minds, whether to play or not at that, it landed outside off and moved further away off the seam, Smith pushed inside the line and then tucked his bat, the ball went way past the outside edge, no where catching the edge
WEST INDIES:1.6  Hafeez to Gayle, no run, back to normal stuff, get forward and block
WEST INDIES:1.5  Hafeez to Gayle, FOUR!!, that has been heaved over mid wicket, it was full outside off and Gayle dragged it from outside off and the ball went racing away to the deep mid wicket fence, there was a fielder, but it beat him comfortably, Gayle will take on Hafeez if it is there in the slot to hit
WEST INDIES:1.4  Hafeez to Gayle, no run, this time goes on the backfoot and blocks it to short mid
WEST INDIES:1.3  Hafeez to Gayle, no run, nice front-foot defensive
WEST INDIES:1.3  Hafeez to Gayle, wide, slides down leg and Kamran Akmal makes a half stop
WEST INDIES:1.2  Hafeez to Gayle, no run, that one took the inside edge, skidded off the track after pitching, Gayle was late in getting his bat down, there was an appeal for LBW, but it clearly took the bat
WEST INDIES:1.1  Hafeez to Gayle, no run, good first ball, a slip in place as well, Gayle gets forward and defends the flat delivery on middleMohammad Hafeez, right-arm off break, comes into the attackHafeez will share the new nut. He has been quite miserly in this World Cup and is coming round the wicket straightaway. A good move early on against Smith and Gayle who are tentative players of spin.
WEST INDIES:0.6  Gul to Smith, no run, pitched on leg and hits Smith high on the pad, Smith shuffled across to tuck it to leg and it hit him on the thigh guard
WEST INDIES:0.5  Gul to Smith, no run, this one pitches way outside off and moves further away, Smith shoulders arms
WEST INDIES:0.4  Gul to Smith, no run, Oh! That cut Smith in half, it pitched around off, kept a bit low, Smith played slightly outside the line of the ball and was lucky that it missed the off stump, signs of uneven bounce already? Maybe.
WEST INDIES:0.3  Gul to Smith, no run, huge shout for LBW, but that pitched outside leg, once that happens you can't be out, Billy Bowden rightfully negates the appeal, Pakistan wisely don't take the review
WEST INDIES:0.2  Gul to Smith, no run, back of a length delivery on off stump, Smith goes on the backfoot and defends well
WEST INDIES:0.1  Gul to Smith, FOUR!!, a couple of slips for Smith, but if you bowl short and wide outside off, it is going to be punished, Smith is a fine cutter of a cricket ball and he rocks back to cut that past a flying point, the man went to his left and it went in vain, cracking cut shot from Smith to get off the mark, the crowd roarSmith and Gayle are at the crease. Smith is on strike. Gul will open the attackAn interesting scene: The Pakistani side break out of the huddle after some encouraging words from Afridi. Then as the West Indian openers came out, Umar Akmal had a few words to say to the King of Cool - Chris Gayle - who did not even look at him and just walked forward. Ha! Already the mind-games have started!National Anthems time: First up is the beautiful melody - 'Rally around the West Indies'. True Caribbean flavor in the anthem. Gayle looks like he has just woken up. But you can turn around and say that's how he always is - cool and laidback. Next up is another wonderful anthem, equally melodious - the Pakistani one. Lots of Pakistani supporters in the stands and they are reciting it vociferously and as it ends a huge roar goes up in the stands.The West Indies have some dangerous players in their ranks and the last time they played at Mirpur - they absolutely demolished the Bangladeshis. So they would be having happy memories going into this knock-out clash. With Gayle and Roach back, and with them batting first, if they post a big score they surely have a great chance of causing an upset.The 'Real' World Cup begins now. 7 sudden death games, win - you progress, lose - you go home. After some pretty lame games during the group stages, everyone will be hoping that these knock-out games are crackers. And today we have a potential cracker - with two unpredictable sides facing off. But to call Pakistan unpredictable in this tournament would be harsh, for they have played consistently well, apart from that New Zealand game.Sammy's reactions right after the toss was something to admire. As soon as the match referee, Chris Broad, told him that it was he who won the toss, he closed both his fists and celebrated as if he got a wicket off his first ball. Well, Saeed Ajmal is in for Pakistan, that's a good sign. The trusted batsman over the years, Chanderpaul is also back. This surely promises to be a cracker of a contest.Afridi: The toss should not make any difference, we will carry with the same attitude that we showed against Australia. The coaches have done a very good job with the team. Rehman and Akhtar are resting, Ajmal is back in today mainly because WI have a couple of left handers. We are going with the same batting order, Razzaq may bat up the order though. We have done a great job until now.Sammy: We would want to bat first. We are going to come out here, put on a good total and defend it. We are more comfortable setting up a total. We have Gayle, Roach and Chanderpaul coming in and glad to welcome them back. Benn, Edwards and Russell miss out. This is where it all counts, what we did in the first round does not matter from here on. The people in the Caribbean would have gotten up early to cheer us.Here's how the teams have lined up:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Kamran Akmal(w), Asad Shafiq, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi(c), Abdul Razzaq, Saeed Ajmal, Wahab Riaz, Umar GulWest Indies (Playing XI): Devon Smith, Chris Gayle, Darren Bravo, R Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Kieron Pollard, Devon Thomas(w), Darren Sammy(c), Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Devendra BishooWest Indies have won the toss and elected to batAlright folks, it's toss time!Pitch report: There is a bit of green grass on the wicket. There is some moisture, there are a few cracks and the team batting second may get some uneven bounce. It is a win the toss and bat first wicket, feels Wasim Akram.Weather report: There was some rain on Tuesday morning, but it looks quite sunny now. The forecast says, it will be a cloudy day as the day progresses. Max temperature of 35 deg.The wicket at Dhaka will be more easier to bat on compared to the ones that we saw in Sri Lanka, feels Waqar Younis. Also, knowing that it is a big game, it won't be a bad option to play Shoaib Akhtar ahead of Wahab Riaz. But, will they? The pitch report and the team news coming next...The first knock out game of the tournament, and it is Pakistan taking on the West Indies at Dhaka. A warm welcome to each one of you. Will it be the Gayle storm that will blow the Pakistanis away? Or will it be Afridi's time to finally get his Boom Boom right? It is the battle of the dark horses, you can say. This is Ajith and I will bring you all the action along with my colleagues, Pradeep, Sid V and Srivathsa. Don't go away, we'll be right back with more updates.by Saurabh SomaniThe first quarter-final clash of the 2011 World Cup has Pakistan with a strangely un-Pakistan feel and West Indies who are not the world-beating champs of yesteryears but not the dust-biting team of the recent past either.
With both sides capable of hitting superb highs as well as less-spectacular lows, the venue is strangely fitting for the teams involved: it has seen the high of a Virender Sehwag 175 in the first match of the World Cup and the low of a 58-all out by the Bangladesh team and the stone pelting incident.Pakistan: Pakistan are supposed to play mercurial cricket - genius one minute, maddening the next. It is therefore of some surprise that they have put up some very consistent performances so far in the tournament. Their only glitch was against New Zealand with Kamran Akmal and Ross Taylor combining for a freakish final few overs that swung the match. Since then Kamran has improved his performance behind the stumps, although 'caught Kamran Akmal' still remains the unluckiest mode of dismissal for a batsman (in fact, some might say it ranks second after 'adjudged out by Asoka de Silva').
Aside from Kamran's fumblings though, Pakistan have looked a very dangerous and cohesive side. They had been rocked by the spot-fixing scandal, losing key players, and losing their status as host nations, but the controversies seem to have acted for the better for the current set of players, helping them bond and play together as a team. Their strength is their bowling with Umar Gul in particular being superb along with Shahid Afridi. To put Pakistan's bowling strength in perspective, imagine a bowling attack reading the following names: Mohammad Aamer, Mohammad Asif, Shoaib Akhtar, Saeed Ajmal. By any yardstick, it would be world class. And yet the first two are serving time, while the latter two have warmed the benches for Pakistan. Akhtar and Ajmal might yet make an appearance in this game - Akthar could replace Wahab Riaz, who is steadier but lacks Akthar's X-factor, while Ajmal could come in for the efficient Abdur Rehman. England and India both used off-spinners successfully against the West Indies, which makes Ajmal's inclusion more likely.West Indies: They had a rather strange league phase, steam-rolling the minnow opposition but coming up short against the stronger teams. They squandered a good start against South Africa to lose by an eventually comfortable margin, and repeated the act against India. Against England, they looked likely winners just 20 minutes before the game ended. And yet, they have lost all three matches. Their inability to put in a 100 overs of good cricket has hurt them against the teams that have the resources to come back into a match, and Pakistan have those in plenty.
The good news for the West Indies is that Chris Gayle and Kemar Roach are fit again and will thus make the final eleven. That will pose an interesting problem for the selectors however, in deciding which pacer to leave out for Roach. The one to get the axe could well be Ravi Rampaul, who took 5/51 against India in their last match. However, Andre Russel's 4/49 and 49 off 46 balls against England will probably tilt the scales in his favour ahead of Rampaul. West Indies only hope to win the match and make their first semi-final since 1996 is to grab the advantage at the start of the innings with both bat and ball. With the bat, Chris Gayle has to set the tone and not allow Umar Gul to settle, while with the ball Kemar Roach and co will have to get into the Pakistan middle order quickly before a platform is set for them.Trivia:The last time the World Cup was held in the subcontinent was also the last time the Quarter-finals were played in the tournament. Then as now, West Indies finished fourth in their group and took on the well-oiled South African team who had topped the other group. Brian Lara then decided to unleash one of his masterpieces to knock South Africa out and West Indies went to the semi-finals to meet pre-tournament favourites Australia.
The situation is eerily similar now, with India replacing Australia as the pre-tournament favourites and Pakistan replacing South Africa as the top side from the other group.The Gayle factor:Given that Kieron Pollard has often been found wanting against high quality pace (exactly of the sort Pakistan have), Chris Gayle is by far the West Indies most important batsman. His ODI stats of an average of more than 39 and a strike rate of almost 84 look reassuring - since with that kind of average a player has to succeed more often than fail. However, his average against Pakistan is only 32.00 and his average against the top seven nations (Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka) is 34. Those averages fall in the realm of the 'inconsistent but devastating on his day' sort of players. West Indies will desperately need Gayle to have his day in the quarter-finals.
