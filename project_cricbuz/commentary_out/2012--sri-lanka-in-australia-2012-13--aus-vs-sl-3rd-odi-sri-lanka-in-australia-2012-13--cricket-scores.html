In the Cape Town Test of 2011, Australia were reduced to 21/9 before Peter Siddle and Nathan Lyon helped Australia reach 47. Today, with Australia at 40/9, Mitchell Starc and Xavier Doherty helped Australia reach 74.Kulasekara: "I am happy that I got my first five wicket haul in ODIs. The wicket is excellent for swing bowling. It is very hot and it is humid and that was aiding my swing. Michael Clarke's wicket was special."Oh boy, where does one start to describe this performance? In conditions that were pretty typical of the Gabba, the Australian batsmen were blown away by the swing of Nuwan Kulasekara. Swinging the ball both ways, both in the air and off the seam, Kulasekara ripped the top order to shreds. He was ably joined by Lasith Malinga and they reduced Australia to 40/9. However, it took some good hits from No.10 Mitchell Starc and No.11 Xavier Doherty to ensure Australia went past their lowest score of 70. These two batsmen were the only epople who managed to get past double figures. However, Eranga snapped up Doherty and Sri Lanka have a target of 75. Join us in a bit for the run-chase.2

A slip in place as Mathews opens the attack.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Mahela Jayawardene(c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Kushal Janith Perera(w), Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Shaminda Eranga, Lasith MalingaAustralia (Playing XI): David Warner, Phillip Hughes, Michael Clarke(c), David Hussey, George Bailey, Matthew Wade(w), Moises Henriques, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Clint McKay, Xavier DohertyAustralia have won the toss and elected to batStat Alert: Sri Lanka have never defeated Australia in an ODI at Brisbane. They will be looking to change this statistic today.For Australia, Michael Clarke and David Warner come back into the team after being rested for the first two ODIs. Their addition boosts the batting line-up which looked a bit frail at Adelaide.Sri Lanka finally registered a win on this tour in Adelaide thanks to a wonderful ton from Lahiru Thirimanne. The bowling is also coming good as a unit and they will look for a better performance at the Gabba.A warm welcome to one and all for the third ODI between Australia and Sri Lanka from Brisbane. The series is poised at an interesting stage and a win for either will give them much needed momentum for the rest of the series.PreviewSri Lanka will hope to use the momentum generated from their thumping win in the 2nd ODI to get another one over the hosts and take a vital lead when the teams meet in Brisbane for the 3rd ODI. Australia will hope that the inclusion of regular players will prove to be a shot in the arm for their team and that they return strongly after losing the last ODI. Australia: Michael Clarke, David Warner, Matthew Wade, Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc are all back to boost the hosts ahead of the vital 3rd ODI. They will want to ensure that they reclaim the lead relinquished in the 2nd ODI and once again assert their dominance over the visiting Sri Lanka. Australia were in top-form in the first came but fell woefully short in the 2nd. They will be hoping that the performance is just a minor blip in their recent form and that they can get back to winnings ways in style. The team will have a different look compared to the first 2 ODIs and this will present them with an opportunity to forget the loss and play freely. Brad Haddin was the only batsman to show some kind of form in the last ODI but his absence will be a blow for Michael Clarke's men and they will hope Wade steps up.Sri Lanka: Lahiru Thirimane's brilliant hundred and Tillkaratne's form at the top will give the hosts some cheer but they will hope that Upul Thranga's form too shows signs of improvement. On the bowling front, Sri Lanka look in top form having reduced the hosts to a paltry score in the last ODI. They will want to pick up from where they left off and ensure the new look AUstralian side endure another shoddy outing with the bat. Their pace attack looks in fime form with lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekara and Angelo Mathews all pikcing up wickets. But they will want their main spinner Ajantha Mendis to carry more threat and pick more wickets. Quotes:The issue where the Australian team now is compared to where it was ten years ago, is ten years ago you had four, five, six, seven great players in one team, so if they were 80% fit, they were still good enough to win a game for Australia. Where we sit now as a team is, it's a lot different to that: Michael ClarkeThe spinners are being taken away from the game, to be honest. Most of the spinners are being very negative now. They are bowling overs aiming for fewer runs rather than trying to take wickets and use their variety: Mahela Jayawardene.Teams:Australia (From): Aaron Finch, Phillip Hughes(w), George Bailey(c), David Hussey, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Brad Haddin, Ben Cutting, Kane Richardson, Clint McKay, Xavier Doherty, Mitchell Johnson, Mitchell Starc, Usman KhawajaSri Lanka (From): Upul Tharanga, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Lahiru Thirimanne, Kushal Janith Perera(w), Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Jeevan Mendis, Thisara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal, Shaminda Eranga, Rangana Herath, Suranga Lakmal, Akila Dananjaya PereraLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
