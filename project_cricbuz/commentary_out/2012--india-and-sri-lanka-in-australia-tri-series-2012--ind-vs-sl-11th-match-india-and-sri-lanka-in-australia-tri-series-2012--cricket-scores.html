Yorker length delivery on the off stump, Tendulkar moves miles across his stumps and tries to flick it away to the on side but gets struck on his foot. He was caught plumb in front of the stumps there and umpire Taufel was quick to raise his finger. Is this the last time we might see Tendulkar on Australian soil? Tendulkar lbw b Malinga 39(30) [4s-5] Malinga to Tendulkar, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
INDIA:9.1  Malinga to Tendulkar, FOUR, slower one from Malinga, Tendulkar picks it and treats it with utter disdain!

Shades of Shahid Afridi and Yusuf Pathan in that shot! Sehwag had just struck a boundary and he didn't need to go for one more. But it was another shortish delivery outside the off, not short enough to pull and it came off the toe end of the bat and went up in the air towards mid-on. Dilshan moves forward and goes down low to take a good catch as the ball was dying on him. Sehwag waits for a while but eventually walks back to the pavilion. Sehwag c Dilshan b Maharoof 30(16) [4s-5 6s-1] Maharoof to Sehwag, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:6.1 Maharoof to Sehwag, FOUR, Sehwag takes the aerial route again!

INDIA:5.5 Nuwan Kulasekara to Tendulkar, no run, fuller on the off stump, driven to cover again. Tendulkar tries to go for a single but it certainly isnt on. Sehwag sends him back and the fielder has a shy at the striker's end. If that would have hit then Tendulkar would have surely been out

INDIA:4.5  Malinga to Sehwag, FOUR, short outside the off stump, Sehwag pulls it across the line in the air to deep mid wicket. The ball drops in the gap but a shocking piece of fielding from Maharoof allows the ball to touch the ropes.

Malinga will open the attackIncase you're wondering why the 2nd innings hasn't started then Jigar Mehta @jigsactin has just tweeted this: "technical issues at the ground mostly power problem"There has indeed been a power failure at the Bellerive OvalThat ends the first innings and Sri Lanka have just dominated the proceedings so far. It was almost as casual as a walk in the park from the Indians. They didn't seem interested at all. The body language was poor, the bowling was ineffective and the fielding was apalling! Sri Lanka made full use of it and batted with a lot of conviction. They seemed more desperate for a win than their neighbours. Sangakkara and Dilshan played some sublime strokes and at times were literally toying with the bowlers. Sangakkara departed shortly after his century but Dilshan went on to score a massive 160 and broke a few records on the way. It looks like an uphill task for the Indians and If I were you I wouldn't place even a dime on them qualifying. Anyway do join us shortly for the chase.4

Thissara Perera run out (Tendulkar/Praveen Kumar) 3(3) Praveen Kumar to Dilshan, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!There's an appeal for a run out. It has gone up the third umpire.

Sri Lanka are almost at the 200 run mark and have another 13 overs left. I honestly can't see India chasing this score down in under 40 overs.

Zaheer will open the attackRight, we are set for the action.. do or die for IndiaTeams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Dinesh Chandimal, Lahiru Thirimanne, Angelo Mathews, Thissara Perera, Farveez Maharoof, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Rangana HerathIndia (Playing XI): Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Praveen Kumar, Zaheer Khan, Umesh YadavMahela:  We just need to concentrate on our game. I have just told the boys to continue with the same. We need to do all the basics right. My attitude and mindset was great the other day and it needs to be continued. We are playing the same team that beat Australia in the last match.Dhoni: We will bowl first. We need to win with a bonus point and it will be easy to assess the situation. We would have batted had we not needed a bonus point. We have been in such situations in the past, the belief is there and we need to go out and express ourselves. Irfan is injured and has been replaced by Zaheer Khan.India have won the toss and elected to fieldPitch Report:  There are a few dark clouds around. The pitch looks like a belter. There is some grass on the wicket but that is dead grass. The team winning the toss should elect to bat first. The experts reckon that India must go into the match with a positive frame of mind.The weather is pretty pleasant at Hobart though some showers are predicted later on. However, Ian Chappell reckons that it will not play spoilsport.The equation for India is pretty simple. Win with a bonus point else pack your bags back home. If India do manage to win with a bonus point, they must then hope that Australia beat Sri Lanka at the MCG on Friday. That will leave both India and Sri Lanka with 15 points each but India will scrape through on the basis of head to head count.It has been a long and hard trip down under. India came in with high expectations in mid December and a couple of months down the lane face the ignominy of utter humiliation. They were whitewashed in the Tests, managed a face saving tie in the T20 matches that followed and are now on the verge of getting knocked out from the CB series before the finals. It has not helped that the team has been beseiged with problems, both injury related and ego hassles. Dhoni has to fight not just the demons outside but those plaguing within. They are up against a team that has peaked just about the right time. Hello, and a warm welcome to one and all to Match 11 of the CB series. We are at the beautiful Blundstone Arena in Hobart. Stay tuned for the toss and team updates..Preview by Ganesh CIndia are sitting on a knife's edge and the pressure is slowly beginning to reveal itself on the players. They still have a slight chance for qualifying for the finals and for that the first thing needed is a win over Sri Lanka with a bonus point. In addition to this, their fate will depend on the Sri Lanka - Australia tie. Sri Lanka need just one more win to go through. They will also be assured of a spot in the final if they do not concede a bonus point against India.For India to gain a bonus point, they will have to score at a rate that is 1.25 times what Sri Lanka do.For example, if Sri Lanka bat first and score 250 in the fifty overs i.e a run rate of 5 then India will need to chase it down in 40 overs to gain a bonus point. Conversely if India bat first and make 250, Sri Lanka will have to be restricted to under 200. It is not an easy task at all for a team that has been struggling with various problems. It is for the same reason that Sri Lanka start as firm favourites.Sri Lanka:Sri Lanka, under Mahela Jayawardene, have shown tremendous resilience so far in the tournament. They began the tournament slowly. Their first win came in only their fourth match but have peaked gradually since then to a good position. The skipper himself has been in sublime touch and his confidence is surely rubbing off on the team. The move to open the batting seems to have done wonders to his confidence. Dinesh Chandimal has been the pillar of the middle order. The young right hander has shown a lot of stomach for a fight and his 80 in Sri Lanka's win against Australia in their previous game drew effusive praise from both skippers. Kumar Sangakkara has been conspicuous by his absence especially with Sri Lanka doing so well. His highest score so far in the tournament has been just 31 and the classy left hander will be desperate to make amends going into the business end of the tournament.In Thisara Perera, Angelo Mathews and Farveez Maharoof, Sri Lanka have three all-rounders well suited for the conditions in Australia and thus add a lot of balance to the squad.The bowling too has a well-rounded look to it. Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulaekara, Rangana Herath and the part time off breaks of Tilakaratne Dilshan pose varying challenges for the opposition.The fielding too has been above par throughout and has been one of the key factors for Sri Lanka turning things around in the tournament. Mahela will be pushing his men to maintain the same intensity against India too to go through to the finals.India:The tour has gone from bad to worse for India. The comments of the skipper MS Dhoni has been hogging headlines after the Sydney ODI against Australia. India feel strongly that they have been short changed in many umpiring decisions. This has shifted focus from their various on-field shortcomings.Foremost amongst them has been the abysmal performance of their batsmen. Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag have not been able to produce even one knock of significance between them. Virat Kohli managed a couple of impressive fifties but has been below par otherwise. The same holds true for Gautam Gambhir too. Suresh Raina falls under the same category of Sehwag and Tendulkar. With such collective failure in batting, it is no wonder that India find themselves languishing at the bottom of the table. They still have a slender chance of qualifying but a lot will depend on whether the batsmen can turn things around overnight.The raw bowling attack has shown some good signs and have bowled well in phases throughout the series. In the absence of Zaheer Khan though, there is a distinct lack of leadership. Only Praveen Kumar and Irfan Pathan have played in ODIs before in Australia and both are battling indifferent form.The youngsters though have shown that they can do well with more experience. R Ashwin and Umesh Yadav have been the most impressive amongst the group and India will do well to persist with them for a longer period.Quotes:You never know. I've played against him on so many occasions, he's produced some brilliant individual performances - Mahela Jayawardene on the threat Sachin Tendulkar poses.That would be saying I am very optimistic, seeing that we have not consistently done well with the bat, which means whatever the opposition scores we will have to score in 40 overs, which will be a very difficult task - MS Dhoni on India bagging a bonus point.Teams:Sri Lanka (From): Mahela Jayawardene(c), Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Kulasekara, Farveez Maharoof, Lasith Malinga, Thissara Perera, Dhammika Prasad, Kumar Sangakkara(w), Sachithra Senanayake, Upul Tharanga, Lahiru Thirimanne, Chanaka Welegedara, Thilan SamaraweeraIndia (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Gautam Gambhir, Ravindra Jadeja, Zaheer Khan, Virat Kohli, Praveen Kumar, Parthiv Patel, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, Virender Sehwag, Rohit Sharma, Rahul Sharma, Sachin Tendulkar, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay Kumar, Umesh YadavLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
