There is a good covering of grass on the wicket. The ball will come on with an even pace in the start and later in the day, the ball comes on a bit more quicker making batting difficult. It will be difficult for the first 10-15 overs but will be an even battle later on.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Hashim Amla(c), Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis, Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Faf du Plessis, Mark Boucher(w), Johan Botha, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn, Lonwabo TsotsobeAustralia (Playing XI): Shane Watson, David Warner, Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke(c), Shaun Marsh, Michael Hussey, Brad Haddin(w), Mitchell Johnson, Pat Cummins, Xavier Doherty, Doug BollingerClarke: The wicket looks drier than I expected it to be. I would have batted on winning the toss. Shaun Marsh comes in for Steven Smith.Amla: Not really concerned about the weather. We will look to play well on a good surface and win this game. No changes in our side for today.South Africa have won the toss and elected to batHello and welcome to the live coverage of the Third and Final ODI between Australia and South Africa. It has been a close battle till now with the 2 match T20 series tied at 1-1 and the ODI series too, is in the balance with both teams winning one match each. Both teams achieved their wins in convincing fashion which is why this match is expected to be a thriller. Stay tuned for the pitch report and toss.Preview by Vishaal LoganathanMichael Hussey has already upped the expectations ahead of the all-important 3rd ODI against South Africa by saying the Australians will treat the game as a 'grand final.' The game has all the settings required to be that 'grand final' with both teams looking well matched in all departments. Australia got themselves in front thanks to a superb effort in the rain curtailed first game while South Africa ensured the momentum swayed back in their favour with an equally emphatic performance in the second game.South AfricaThe hosts did immensely well to draw level in the second game with a thorough performance. They will be delighted with the form shown by the top order with 4 of their top 6 getting to impressive fifties. However, their stand-in skipper Hashim Alma's failure at the top would be a worrying factor.On the bowling front, Morne Morkel stole all the headlines with an absolutely superb performance picking up 4 wickets while giving away just 22 runs off 10 overs. Dale Steyn and Lonwabo Tsotsobe too played able supporting roles picking up 2 wickets each.South Africa will back themselves to come good for the second game in a row after having handed the Aussies a humiliating loss in the last game.Player to watch out for: Morne Morkel was the star performer in the last game. Another similar performance will surely see the Proteas lift the trophy.AustraliaAustralia's thumping loss in the last game will be a more bitter pill to swallow after Shane Watson's injury while bowling. The all rounder adds a lot to the former World Champions and they will be without a key player should he be ruled out of the last game.Australia had their chances to put South Africa on the mat in the second game but failed to seize the opportunity. Doug Bollinger gave them a breakthrough off the very first ball and they also had their chance when they got 3 quick wickets at the half way mark. They will not want to give the South Africans such let offs. Xavier Doherty was their best bowler but the team from Down Under will want the rest to pull up their socks and give a much better performance.The only bright spot for the Aussies while batting was David Warner, the southpaw played a superb knock but lacked support. Apart from him only Michael Hussey and Steven Smith managed to go past the 20 run mark as they were bundled out for 223.Player to watch out for: Ricky Ponting is a big match player and the Australians need their former skipper to be at the top of his game if they are to win.QuotesThe intensity at training has probably been as high as I can remember in any Australian team. The boys have really worked hard and that's why I think it's important not to dwell too much on a pretty ordinary day for us in our last game - Michael HusseyIt's a must win for both teams, but I don't see it being any different from any other game. The way we prepare for the game will be totally the same. Hopefully we can put in another clinical performance like we did on Sunday - JP DuminyTeams:Australia (From): Michael Clarke(c), Cameron White, Shane Watson, Doug Bollinger, Pat Cummins, Brett Lee, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, James Pattinson, Steven Smith, David Warner, Xavier Doherty, Brad Haddin(w), Ricky Ponting, Michael Hussey, Mitchell JohnsonSouth Africa (From): Hashim Amla(c), Johan Botha, Jean-Paul Duminy, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Robin Peterson, Graeme Smith, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Mark Boucher(w), Jacques Kallis, Imran Tahir, Faf du Plessis, Dale SteynLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
