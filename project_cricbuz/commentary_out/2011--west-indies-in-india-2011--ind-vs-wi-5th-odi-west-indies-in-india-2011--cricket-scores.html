WEST INDIES:9.4  Mithun to J Mohammed, out Lbw!! Mr. Sudhir Asnani gives it OUT this time around! This looked closer than the previous one, might have clipped the leg stump.

There was no appeal from the bowler, Parthiv was the only one who appealed, but the umpire has raised the finger, Marlon Samuels is stunned! That bounced a bit more and swung as it passed the bat, Samuels could do nothing but hang his bat at that, there was no sound, there was no such deflection, but, well, after the umpire makes his decision, nothing else matters. I haven't seen any other batsman walk as slowly as this man is walking back to the pavilion. Marlon Samuels c Parthiv Patel b Mithun 6(11) [4s-1] Mithun to Marlon Samuels, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

WEST INDIES:4.5  Irfan Pathan to Marlon Samuels, FOUR, Ah! That's unlucky! Manoj Tiwary was standing slightly wide at slip, Marlon Samuels opened the face and just ran it between the keeper and the slip fielder, the lack of bounce meant that it was a safe shot to attempt, Irfan Pathan is disappointed, rightly so!

WEST INDIES:0.4  Irfan Pathan to Marlon Samuels, no run, huge appeal!!

Irfan Pathan will open the attackWelcome back, dear viewers from around the world. It was evident from the latter half of the Indian batting that the wicket is very slow and it will be tough to tackle the spinners. India have plenty of spin options, and it will take a spirited performance from the West Indies batsmen to chase down 267. Having said that, all eyes will be on Irfan Pathan, who is making a comeback. This is Ajith, your commentator for the first 15 overs.Both teams will take this score. India recovered from 1/2 to post a respectable 267. WI will feel that they have done pretty well to drag India back towards the final few overs. The pitch is staying low and slow and the ball lost its colour rapidly making it very difficult for the batsmen to force the pace towards the end. Manoj Tiwary scored a fine maiden ODI ton and he will be proud of his efforts. Join us at 18:20 for the chase.4

This is Ajith - your commentator for the first few overs.IndianAce1, one of our chat users, believes that Ravindra Jadeja can be included in the list of specialist bowlers. You agree?Gambhir forgot to mention the other change. Manoj Tiwary also gets a chance while Vinay Kumar is rested. India have 3 specialist bowlers, Irfan Pathan, Abhimanyu Mithun and Rahul Sharma. Rohit, Kohli, Tiwary, Raina and R Jadeja will have to fill in 20 overs among themselves.Teams:India (Playing XI): Gautam Gambhir(c), Ajinkya Rahane, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Manoj Tiwary, Ravindra Jadeja, Parthiv Patel(w), Irfan Pathan, Abhimanyu Mithun, Rahul SharmaWest Indies (Playing XI): Lendl Simmons, Kieran Powell, Marlon Samuels, Denesh Ramdin(w), Kieron Pollard, Darren Sammy(c), Andre Russell, Jason Mohammed, Anthony Martin, Sunil Narine, Kemar RoachSammy: It has been a long trip, some of our guys are injured. We've competed well but we haven't been good enough. Today, we would look to perform better and end the tour on a winning note. Barring a few match changing moments or sessions, we have done pretty well. Hyatt and Rampaul are out. Martin and Jason Mohammed will play.Gambhir: We will bat first, once we put runs on the board it will be tough for the opposition to chase it on a turning track. Viru deserves the rest after such a performance. Every game is important, the guys are raring to go. Ashwin and Viru are rested. Rahane and Irfan come in place of them.India have won the toss and elected to batToss time, Ravi Shastri is out with the captains. Surprisingly, Gambhir has come out.Pitch report by Sunil Gavaskar: There will be some turn for the spinners, but the ball will come onto the bat nicely, as it does in Chennai always. If the Indians bat first, this will surely be a high scoring game but if the Windies bat first, Rahul Sharma and Co. will look to exploit the surface and restrict them below 200. I predict a combined score of 520 at least.Hello folks. Sehwag's fans might still be in a hangover after that mammoth 219. A lot has been spoken about that and it's now time to welcome you all to the 5th and the final ODI between India and West Indies from Chennai. An inconsequential tie this, with India having already taken an unassailable 3-1 lead. Looks like Irfan Pathan will get a nod today. The West Indies would look to end this miserable tour on a high note by putting up a determined performance today. Will it be 4-1 for India? Don't go away, we'll bring you all the action as and when it unfolds.Preview by Ganesh ChandrashekaranWith the Sehwag epic sealing the series in Indore, India and West Indies will battle it out one last time in Chennai with just pride at stake. For West Indies though the game will be much more than pride. The young team under Darren Sammy have been consistently punching above their weight throughout the Tests and ODIs with Indore being the only aberration. They will be desperate to prove that they are good enough to win more than just one game on the tour for a 3-2 scoreline would read much better than 4-1. India, on the other hand, will not be willing to take their feet off the pedal. They have had a fantastic run in ODIs at home in the recent past and will be keen to enhance their reputation. It is also a chance for some of the players on the fringe to make a mark if given a chance.India:The confidence gained from the thumping win in the fourth ODI will be tremendous. Virender Sehwag himself needed some runs under his belt before that game and he responded in style and got his first series win as a captain. Gautam Gambhir and Suresh Raina were the other batsmen who had not made a significant contribution up until then but the flat track at Indore along with Sehwag's demolition of the WI bolwers' confidence helped themselves to useful fifties. They would be eager to carry on with the positive frame of mind and get a big one to boost their confidence.India will also ponder over some changes for the dead rubber. Ajinkya Rahane, Manoj Tiwary and Irfan Pathan are the only players who have not got a game yet in the series and this could be their opportunity. The three will not have far to look to gain some inspiration. Rahul Sharma managed to grab some eye balls in his debut game and was the star with the ball picking three wickets in his first three overs in the 4th game. All three have been in good form in the domestic level and Irfan in particular will be eager to grab the opportunity if given a chance. A good performance here could well earn him a spot in the squad for Australia in case of another injury to one of the pacers already selected. Even otherwise this could be his chance to stay in the reckoning for future tournaments.West Indies:Darren Sammy is under a lot of pressure with questions repeatedly being raised regarding his value in the team. He did not help himself either in the game at Indore with his dropped catch of Sehwag remaining fresh in everyone's memory. To his credit though, the West Indies skipper has managed to make the team stick together throughout the tour and as said earlier, they have proved that they are no walkovers. India have been stretched in almost every game on the tour with some bright individual performances and consistent collective efficiency.Ravi Rampaul and Kemar Roach have shown some admirable spirit on flat tracks and have never shown signs of backing away from the challenge. Sunil Narine has shown some promise with the ball and, along with Andre Russell, he could be one of the key players in the shorter formats for West Indies in the coming years.The batting has been a let down and the inexperienced line up has been quite brittle. Lendl Simmons has not managed to get the big ones despite some impressive starts and this is becoming quite an unhealthy pattern in his young career. Marlon Samuels' batting has alternated between awe inspiring to gag inducing in his short stays at the crease. West Indies need him to take on the role of a senior mentor and put in the performances to gain respect among his peers. Keiron Pollard has been an even bigger let down. He comes in with a huge reputation and fat pay cheques but has done nothing to warranty the same in this series. He needs some runs under his belt very soon if he has to cling on to his place in the ODI side.Quotes:I have been interacting with Eric Simmons regarding variations and that has helped me a lot. I am also learning a lot while playing alongside Ashwin. I hope to improve with experience - Rahul SharmaWe have shown a lot of character in the series where a couple of matches could have gone either way - Denesh RamdinTeams:West Indies (From): Darren Sammy(c), Adrian Barath, Darren Bravo, Kieran Powell, Denesh Ramdin(w), Ravi Rampaul, Kemar Roach, Marlon Samuels, Danza Hyatt, Anthony Martin, Jason Mohammed, Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell, Lendl SimmonsIndia (From): Varun Aaron, Ravichandran Ashwin, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Virender Sehwag(c), Rahul Sharma, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, Parthiv Patel(w), Suresh Raina, Manoj Tiwary, Vinay Kumar, Abhimanyu Mithun, Irfan PathanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms2h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous4h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
