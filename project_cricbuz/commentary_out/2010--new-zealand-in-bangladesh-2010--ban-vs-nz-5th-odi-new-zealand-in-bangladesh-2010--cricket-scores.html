The hosts are leading the series by 3-0 and will be looking for a clean sweep.Preview by Vishaal LoganathanBangladesh's stand in skipper, Shakib Al Hasan's call for a 4-0 sweep against the New Zealanders at home, after the 3rd ODI could now become a reality as Bangladesh have gone on to shock the cricketing fraternity by winning 3 consecutive ODIs against the Kiwis. Bangladesh have demonstrated how dangerous they can be in familiar conditions as they notched up one win after another in the 5 match ODI series to go into the 5th and final ODI with an unassailable 3-0 lead.Many would have thought the Kiwis suffered a minor hiccup in their World Cup preparations when they lost their first ODI. A lot more would have expected them to bounce back strongly after the loss, but the Kiwis suffered two more defeats at the hands a far more inferior Bangladesh side. If their bowling has struggled to penetrate the dogged Bangladesh batsmen regularly, their batting is nothing to write home about either. While for Bangladesh, they seem to have found a very good balance with the batsmen and bowlers complimenting the good work done by the other.Skipper Shakib was in superb form in the 4th ODI to inspire his team to victory. Shakib battled his way to a superb century and also picked up 3 wickets to further enhance his reputation as a superb all rounder. Bangladesh's 3 victories have all revolved around superb bowling displays. They have dismissed the Kiwi side for much less than what they would have hoped to score on all three occasions.Their batting too has been very steady and helped the team post respectable totals and also chase down the target with relative ease. They did suffer a collapse in the 4th ODI but Shakib led from the front with a century to help them seal a historic series win.Kiwi captain, Daniel Vettori admitted that the Bangladeshis taught them how to play cricket in the sub continental conditions. Three consecutive losses would have damaged the confidence of a lot of players in the dressing room and they will be desperately hoping to avoid an embarrassing 4-0 loss at the hands of Bangladesh.Their batting has been the biggest worry with the batsmen struggling against the Bangladesh spinners. The spinners have accounted for most of the wickets and New Zealand will hope that their batsmen are able to counter them in the final match. Kane Williamson batted superbly in the last game and his form was probably the silver lining for the New Zealanders. The youngster displayed tremendous character and almost helped the Black-Caps pull off an improbable win towards the end. New Zealand will be hoping for someone to repeat that kind of performance and end the tour with at least 1 win under their belt.The Bangladeshis would be on cloud nine following the superb win and series triumph but it will be important from their point of view to keep the momentum going and a 4-0 series sweep would do wonders to their confidence and belief. The team has gelled brilliantly and everyone looks to be in good nick.The New Zealanders would be going into this match hoping to salvage some pride and give their countrymen something to cheer about after three less than impressive performances.Teams:Bangladesh (From): Shakib Al Hasan(c), Abdur Razzak, Dolar Mahmud, Imrul Kayes, Jahurul Islam, Junaid Siddique, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur Rahim(w), Naeem Islam, Raqibul Hasan, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Shahriar Nafees, Suhrawadi Shuvo, Syed RaselNew Zealand (From): Daniel Vettori(c), Hamish Bennett, Grant Elliott, Brendon McCullum(w), Nathan McCullum, Andy McKay, Kyle Mills, Aaron Redmond, Jesse Ryder, Tim Southee, Shanan Stewart, Ross Taylor, Daryl Tuffey, BJ Watling, Kane WilliamsonLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
