The captain was torn apart by the media for avoiding questions on the tainted cricketers while the BCCI pulled all stops to ensure that the contingent traveling to England for the Champions Trophy was kept away from the glare of the press and any other distraction that threatened to malign the reputation of the world champions any further. In such a set-up did India start their campaign in a tournament that was in its last edition. Never had MS Dhoni's men done justice to their talent after the IPL and yet another stern test awaited them in hostile conditions, where they had been exposed two years ago. Only three from the present squad - Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, and Dhoni were part of World Cup winning side of 2011. No Tendulkar, no Sehwag, no Gambhir, no Zaheer, no Yuvraj. It was time for the next generation to stand up and be counted. The new-look India side have done it and in style. Led by Shikhar Dhawan, a young batting line-up has done wonders. The southpaw has batted like a man possessed and showed the world that his blistering century on Test debut against Australia was no fluke. Rohit Sharma, who has been in the line of fire for not realising his talent, finally came good at the top of the order, and with Dhawan helped India to rock solid opening partnerships, while Dinesh Karthik showed he was ready for another stint at international cricket with back-to-back tons in the warm-up games and a composed half-century in the group stages. Kohli has not been in the thick of things like Dhawan has, but he has done his bit. His solid half-century in the side's chase against Sri Lanka was testimony to his grit and abilities in swinging conditions. The fact that Raina and Dhoni have not been called on to do much work is indication of the sublime form of the top-order. The surprise package for the team has been the bowling department. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar has swung the ball prodigiously while Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav have worked up some serious pace. Ravindra Jadeja continued the good work from the home series against Australia, with 10 wickets in four games, and he has been ably assisted by R Ashwin in the spin department. The fielding, too, has been exceptional, with the likes of Dhawan, Rohit, Raina, Kohli, and Karthik manning the 30-yard circle like tigers. Never has there been an easy run for the opposition batsmen with these five men on the prowl. It would be fair to say that a lot of the pain felt after the spot-fixing scandal erupted last month has eased off, thanks to some breathtaking cricket. If India were to put it across England Sunday (June 23), they will create history. If the last edition of the Champions Trophy is bagged by the world champions after a period of gloom and despair, it will not only add to the legend of their captain, but also mark the rest of the team as a force to reckon with in the years to come. Key players: Shikhar Dhawan has stamped his class all over England. A century against South Africa, followed by another against West Indies, a 48 against Pakistan and a 68 against Sri Lanka means the Delhi opener has accumulated 332 runs from four games at an average of nearly 111 and is far ahead of the rest of the pack in the run-scoring stakes - Kumar Sangakkara, with 222 runs is a distant second while Jonathan Trott, in third place with 209 runs, will have to score a big hundred to challenge the Indian southpaw's reign at the top. The bowling department will once again depend on the resourceful Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who has struck regularly with the new ball, the in-form Ishant Sharma (fresh from a Man of the Match award in the semi-final) and the spin of Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandra Ashwin to make deep inroads into the England batting. Weak Links: Such has been India's dominance in the tournament that it seems virtually impossible to identify a weak link in the side. That said, it needs to be said that the middle-order has remained largely untested, what with the bowlers and Dhawan doing the bulk of the damage for India, Raina and Dhoni have each had a bat in only one game - the opener against South Africa. So in case India were to lose early wickets, it would be interesting to see how these two seasoned campaigners steady their nerves and the team under pressure. Probable XI:RG Sharma, S Dhawan, V Kohli, SK Raina, KD Karthik, MS Dhoni (Captain & WK), RA Jadeja, R Ashwin, I Sharma, B Kumar, UT Yadav England:Team News: While India are playing in their third Champions Trophy final, it will a second chance for England. Apart from a World T20 title, the English have never won any other major ICC silverware. The tie against the world champions on Sunday will be enough motivation for them to try and set that sorry record right. With the first leg of the Ashes round the corner, Alastair Cook, would love to kick-start the summer with a resounding ICC Champions Trophy win over the top ODI side in the world. Unlike India, England have not been flamboyant on the road to the final, but they have played solid, winning cricket. Jonathan Trott has been the main man with the bat, collecting 209 runs so far. He sits on third place on the table of top run scorers. The bowling, as always, has been led with aplomb by the heroic James Anderson. Cook, Root, and Ian Bell have made adequate if not outstanding contributions with the bat, while Ravi Bopara (S/R: 144+) has done an excellent job at the finish. England's bowlers had a disappointing day out against the Sri Lankans, when they could not defend a total of nearly 300, but they have come back well since and dismissed South Africa for 175 in the semi-final. All said and done there seems little the English camp needs to be overly concerned about - give or take their known vulnerability against the bowling of Jadeja. Still, it's fair to say two evenly-matched sides will clash in the final of what has so far been a great tournament (give or take a few rain delays). The final should be a tight one with both sides playing some great cricket. Key players: Without a shadow of doubt Trott and Anderson. While Trott has been the rock in the England batting line-up, Anderson has been skillful and incisive as ever with the ball. Two of England's most senior pros have stood up and delivered in a high-profile tournament. Cook, too, should be reasonably pleased with his own form and that of young Root's - the 22-year-old has been consistent with the bat and promises to be a big match player with his ice-cool temperament. Weak links: Stuart Broad has had a rather ordinary time in the middle. Expected to be a key asset with the ball in the Ashes, Broad has been a disappointment in the Champions Trophy. His figures in the semi-final may well read 3/50, but two of those wickets were of tail-enders and South Africa were bowled out for a paltry 175; in other words, Broad leaked more than a quarter of those runs. Probable XI:AN Cook (Captain), IR Bell, IJL Trott, JE Root, EJG Morgan, RS Bopara, JC Buttler (WK), SCJ Broad, JM Anderson, JC Tredwell, ST Finn Quotes: "I hope we are peaking. There's obviously still a lot of cricket left this summer, and I hope it will be a great one for England."- Jonathan Trott "Obviously, the support in the team, and the support from the captain is very crucial for any player, not only for me. I think MS is always supporting every youngster in the team. So I think he's been tremendous with everyone." - Ishant Sharma Teams:England (From): Alastair Cook(c), Jonathan Bairstow, Ravi Bopara, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, Joe Root, James Tredwell, Chris Woakes, James Anderson, Ian Bell, Tim Bresnan, Jos Buttler(w), Eoin Morgan, Graeme Swann, Jonathan TrottIndia (From): MS Dhoni(w/c), Shikhar Dhawan, Dinesh Karthik, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Irfan Pathan, Ishant Sharma, Murali Vijay, Umesh Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli, Amit Mishra, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Vinay Kumar, Ravichandran AshwinLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
