Skipper Mushfiqur and Naeem Islam were involved in a record partnership of 154, which is the highest for Bangladesh against New Zealand for any wicket. Mushfiqur played well throughout and picked up the right balls to put away before he threw his wicket away 10 short of his hundred. Islam struggled early on but saw off that period and went on to make 84. The New Zealand bowlers started off well with Southee being the pick of the bowlers on his comeback. He was well supported by Neesham. The spinners could not contain the batsmen in the middle overs but the pacers came back well to restrict them to a decent total. Join us in a few minutes for the run chase....4

Toss and teams in a few minutes....PreviewNew Zealand will be seeking to avenge a humiliating loss to Bangladesh three years ago when the one-day international series against the hosts starts in Dhaka on Tuesday. New Zealand were stunned in 2010 when they went down 4-0 to a young Bangladeshi side, a drubbing that sparked repercussions back home with several team officials forced to quit. New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum insisted on Monday that the current side has learnt the lessons from that defeat. "We certainly haven't forgotten it, 4-0 was a very one-sided contest which Bangladesh thoroughly deserved to win," McCullum said ahead of the first ODI. "We played some bad shots, we weren't prepared for the series and we have tried to plan against that by having guys prepare a lot better. "From our point of view we want to carve out our own performances, and it would be great for us to turn the tables from what happened the last time," he said. New Zealand were frustrated in the just finished Test series, with both matches against the hosts in Chittagong and Dhaka ending in a draw. But McCullum said he was more confident of his side's chances in the one-dayers, pointing to the experience and success of the players in the shorter game. "We have got more experience in the one-day side," he told a press conference in Dhaka. "I think, now the Test team we are developing as a Test team we are nowhere near the finished product. I think the one-day team is pretty set in how we play." "We have had more success in the one-day game of late, we probably feel a lot more confident in the one-day format at this point of time." Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim was drawing inspiration from the Test series, which they dominated in phases, while also remembering their stunning success three years ago."If you see the overall results, we have earned a lot of positive things in terms of individual performances and the team as well," Mushfiqur said. "So from this side, everyone is confident. The last time we played against them we won 4-0 in the ODIs, so we have good memories, although that is three to four years ago. "I think in our own ground we are a strong side in ODIs. If we can play up to our potential in all the three departments then we will do well," he said. However, Bangladesh suffered an injury blow in the lead up to the series, with pace bowler Shafiul Islam ruled out with an twisted ankle to be replaced by Al-Amin Hossain. All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and batsman Mominul Haque were also suffering from fever, but Mushfiqur said both should be available for Tuesday's first match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.
