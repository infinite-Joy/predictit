It wasn't a wicket ball by any means, but the Indians know that it will perhaps be the game changer. A full toss outside the off stump, Afridi made room looking to go over extra cover, the bottom hand comes off as he swings hard, ends up slicing it straight to cover, Sehwag is as safe as houses. Bhajji is going ballistic, he knows how important that wicket was. Afridi c Sehwag b Harbhajan 19(17) [4s-1] Harbhajan to Afridi, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Nehra is not sure, he does not claim it. The men in the middle have taken the help of the TV umpire! Afridi pulled the short ball, there was Nehra at deep mid wicket and the ball was dying on him.

Misbah is doing a very smart job here by playing second fiddle to Umar Akmal. The ball will be changed after this over. There is a batting powerplay for the Pakistanis. A wicket or two will surely bring India back on top. Dhoni is having a word or two with Zaheer Khan, but they decide to go in with Harbhajan. Can he deliver?It will be the last Drinks break of the evening. The match is all set for an absolute thriller here. With that, I, Sid V, will hand it over to Ajith, who will finish things off here.

PAKISTAN:4.3  Munaf Patel to Kamran Akmal, 2 runs, short ball, Kamran Akmal looks to pull, a top edge falls wide of mid on, lucky that it didn't carry to the fielder, Munaf Patel is running hard, that was bowled at around 141 kph
PAKISTAN:4.2  Munaf Patel to Kamran Akmal, no run, back of a length and right on middle and off, pushed back to the bowlers, a nice little stare, a couple of words exchanged betwen the bowler and the batsman
PAKISTAN:4.1  Munaf Patel to Kamran Akmal, no run, starts off with a peach of a delivery! lands just in front of a length and shapes away from Kamran Akmal's bat, he was stretching forward for the drive, the ball whistles past the outside edge of the batMunaf Patel, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackGambhir is holding his hamstring and he leaves the field. Meanwhile, a bowling change.
PAKISTAN:3.6  Nehra to Hafeez, no run, that's been cut wide of point but Yuvi does well to move to his left and take it on the bounce, sometimes it is really hard to judge the bounce in the outfield, did well on that occasion
PAKISTAN:3.5  Nehra to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, on the pads again, tucked off the pads behind square on the on side, they are off to a great start, the Indians need to curb the singles to put more pressure on the batsmen
PAKISTAN:3.4  Nehra to Hafeez, 1 run, worked off his pads through mid wicket, they wanted the second run, but Gambhir in the deep is quick, they will only get a single
PAKISTAN:3.3  Nehra to Hafeez, no run, Kohli this time, a small fumble, runs in from short extra cover and does not bend down to collect the ball, it was just tapped to the off side, meanwhile adds more pressure to the man fielding at mid off, they don't take the single though
PAKISTAN:3.2  Nehra to Hafeez, no run, no slips in place for Hafeez, length ball, around the off stump and thereabouts, Hafeez pushes it to the off side, one of the two close in fielders on the off side runs in to collect
PAKISTAN:3.1  Nehra to Hafeez, FOUR!!, we'll it's been easy going so far for the openers, width on offer, Hafeez leans nicely into the drive and creams it through extra cover, all too easy, this is forcing Dhoni to make a lot of changes to the field
PAKISTAN:2.6  Zaheer to Kamran Akmal, no run, another chance of a run out? Ah, tough to call, Kamran Akmal struck that hard but Sehwag at short cover dived and got some hand to take the pace off the ball, it goes towards Tendlya who runs in and throws it hard to the keeper, a direct hit was required but he can't get it
PAKISTAN:2.5  Zaheer to Kamran Akmal, no run, Kamran Akmal punches it off the frontfoot with an open face, on one bounce to Kohli at shortish point
PAKISTAN:2.4  Zaheer to Hafeez, 1 run, length ball around the off stump, Hafeez just pats it towards Sachin at mid off, puts pressure on him, takes him on and completes a quick single, Sachin can't bend down and collect the ball
PAKISTAN:2.3  Zaheer to Hafeez, FOUR!!, wristy! It was a length ball angled in, Hafeez closes the face of the bat and works it using his wrists between mid wicket and mid on, Bhajji gives up the chase
PAKISTAN:2.2  Zaheer to Hafeez, no run, fuller this time around, square driven to Yuvraj at point, unnecessary shy at the stumps at the bowler's end, mid on was backing up
PAKISTAN:2.1  Zaheer to Kamran Akmal, 3 runs, angled in from wide of the crease, but it was still outside the off stump for Kamran Akmal, he lured into the drive and gets it through extra cover, Raina gives it a chase, slides well and prevents it from running all the way, three runs for Kamran AkmalTwo overs, 12 for none. Just the two deliveries that has missed the bat and Zaheer decides to go round the wicket to the right hander!
PAKISTAN:1.6  Nehra to Hafeez, no run, pitched up this time, off stumpish from Nehra, nicely tapped towards mid off, he leant nicely and played under his chin
PAKISTAN:1.5  Nehra to Hafeez, 2 runs, on the pads and nicely flicked away behind square, Zaheer at fine leg keeps it down to two, it has been a confident start from these two batsmen so far
PAKISTAN:1.4  Nehra to Kamran Akmal, 1 run, banged in short, but comes a lot slower than Kamran Akmal expected, he was early into the pull, mistimes it behind square on the on side just for a single
PAKISTAN:1.3  Nehra to Kamran Akmal, no run, cracker! That one was angled away, landed on off and straightened, Kamran Akmal was expecting the ball to angle away and he went for the cover drive, beaten all ends up
PAKISTAN:1.2  Nehra to Hafeez, 1 run, deliberately done! Plays away from the body and the ball goes off the thickish outer half towards third man, just a single
PAKISTAN:1.1  Nehra to Hafeez, no run, slightly short of a good length delivery, nice and straight, Hafeez gets behind the line and defends it to the left of the bowler towards mid off, he got into a nice position to defend thatAshish Nehra, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
PAKISTAN:0.6  Zaheer to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, gorgeous! Zaheer made it easy for Kamran Akmal by bowling an overpitched delivery and it was straight driven to perfection by Kamran Akmal, mid off didn't move an inch, and mid on was nowhere in question, races away towards the sight-screen, two boundaries for Kamran, quick start for Pak
PAKISTAN:0.5  Zaheer to Kamran Akmal, no run, lands on a length and angling across, Kamran Akmal pushes it towards mid off, didn't hit that hard though
PAKISTAN:0.4  Zaheer to Kamran Akmal, no run, keeps low! that was a Jaffa! Forced Kamran Akmal to play at it and the slight low bounce with the away movement did Kamran Akmal in, the ball whistles past the off stump and Dhoni has to bend down to collect
PAKISTAN:0.3  Zaheer to Kamran Akmal, no run, pitched outside leg and shapes across slightly, rapped on the pad as he misses the flick shot, once it pitches outside leg, LBW is out of the question, no appeal from the Indians
PAKISTAN:0.2  Zaheer to Kamran Akmal, no run, pitched up and more towards middle and off this time, driven back down the wicket, good stop by Zaheer off his own follow-through
PAKISTAN:0.1  Zaheer to Kamran Akmal, FOUR!!, What a way to get off the mark! It was a length ball angled across Kamran Akmal, he gets forward and square drives it between point and cover point, the outfield is quick and the ball will beat the fielder who was giving the chaseKamran Akmal and Hafeez are at the crease. Kamran Akmal is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackWelcome back to the chase. Pakistan have done well to restrict India to 260, but this is a semi final, a pressure game and chasing won't be easy. No Ashwin for India, but Dhoni has always been a gambler. Will his luck do the talking yet again? Talking about Pakistan, Afridi hasn't fired for them with the bat, will it be his day? This is Ajith and I'll be with you until the first drinks break. Are you ready to go? The players have made their way out. Zaheer has the new ball in his hand.Raina: I think 260 is enough, we have Bhajji and Yuvraj Singh, the wicket is skidding and if we bowl at the right areas, it should be enough. We lost a few wickets in the middle after a good partnership, and that didn't help us. But we did well to get 260. I'm there, Sachin is there, hopefully we'll do well. (On asked whether they wanted Ashwin to be in the side)Dhoni failed again and in the end it was left to Raina to add some useful runs. At one stage what looked like a score of over 320 when the Sehwag was on the rampage ended up on 260. Will that be enough? It looks like 20 runs short at least. But with the added pressure of a World Cup semi-final, runs on the board will mean more pressure for the Pakistanis. We will see what happens when we return for the chase in a short while.A collapse after being in the box seat has put India in a dicey situation in this crucial semi-final. It happened against England, then against South Africa and now. But one has to give full credit to Riaz for bringing his side back into the game with a terrific spell. He sent back Kohli and Yuvraj off consecutive balls and that set India back. Sachin Tendulkar perhaps played the patchiest innings of his ODI life - having been dropped 4 times and surviving a couple of close calls. All the 4 catches were easy ones too. Pakistan finally sent him back via a catch by Afridi.4
INDIA:49.6  Riaz to Raina, 2 runs, full toss and it's been creamed wide of long off, the fielder slides and keeps it down to two, Hafeez was the man, and 260 is what the Indians have managed. The Pakistani over rate hasn't been good, we'll be back at 6:45 PM ISTMunaf Patel, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:49.5  Riaz to Nehra, out Nehra Run Out!! Nehraaaaaaaaaaaaa! Goes after a wide delivery and misses, Raina wants to sneak in a bye, Nehra is late to respond, Kamran throws the ball to the bowler and he removes the middle stump, Nehra was well short of the crease, that's the end. Nehra run out (Kamran Akmal/Riaz) 1(2) Riaz to Nehra, THATS OUT!! Run Out!!
INDIA:49.4  Riaz to Raina, 1 run, in the blockhole, Raina drills it down to long on, and surprisingly, they just take a single, there was an easy two in that one

INDIA:49.2 Riaz to Zaheer, out Caught by Kamran Akmal!! A wonderful spell from Riaz this, gets his fifer! Zaheer chases a wide delivery, it was angling away from Zaheer who reached out with minimum footwork, just a faint edge through to the keeper, Kamran Akmal has the widest of smiles on his faces, Riaz bends down to kiss the sand, fantastic bowling display from the Pakistani speedster. Zaheer c Kamran Akmal b Riaz 9(10) [4s-1] Riaz to Zaheer, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
INDIA:49.1  Riaz to Zaheer, no run, too full and well outside off, Zaheer can't squeeze it wide of the keeper, beaten againBatting powerplay stats: 43 runs, just 1 wicket. Well, that's a change in fortunes for sure.
INDIA:48.6  Gul to Raina, FOUR!!, Raina at his attractive best! Too full and on the pads, flicked away wide of the man at short fine leg, there was only one way the ball was heading, this innings of Raina is worth its weight in gold
INDIA:48.5  Gul to Raina, 2 runs, another full toss, cracked through extra cover towards Umar Akmal in the deep, he can't release the ball soon, Zaheer responds to Raina's call and completes the second run with easeRaina asks for a change in bat! why doesn't he just take Yusuf Pathan's willow? I'm sure it would work.
INDIA:48.4  Gul to Zaheer, 1 run, the 250 is up for India and the crowds cheer! It was struck hard straight past the bowler by Zaheer, Younis Khan at long off does well, runs fast to his right and keeps it down to one
INDIA:48.3  Gul to Raina, 1 run, Raina swings through the line, goes over vacant mid on, the ball goes to Younis Khan at long on after bouncing a couple of times, gets only a single

INDIA:47.6  Riaz to Zaheer, no run, Zaheer backs away a bit, looks to slap hard and as we've seen for more than one instance today, no contact made
INDIA:47.5  Riaz to Zaheer, FOUR!!, It doesn't matter how they come! Runs are all that matters, Zaheer was looking to go big over mid wicket, swings his bat and gets a leading edge over point, gets it over the infield and the ball runs away to the point boundary
INDIA:47.4  Riaz to Zaheer, no run, runs in and angles one into the right hander from wide of the crease, Zaheer shuffles in the crease and looks to unsettle the bowler, can't do so, he swings and misses
INDIA:47.4  Riaz to Zaheer, wide, too full and wide outside the off stump, Zaheer looks to back away and squeeze it behind square, no contact made, wide called, it was touch and go, but a wide would bring some cheer to the crowd
INDIA:47.3  Riaz to Zaheer, 2 runs, Zaheer has lost his mind! He has to just give a single to Raina, but what does he do? Makes room and looks to go big, ends up slicing it over extra cover, falls safe though, gets two runs
INDIA:47.2  Riaz to Zaheer, no run, Zaheer looks to walk down the track, make room and steer one down to the third man region, beaten!
INDIA:47.1  Riaz to Raina, leg byes, 1 run, full and down the leg, Raina can't flick it across, rapped on the pad and it ricochets to the off side, Zaheer wants a single, Raina responds, Riaz had to run all the way to collect the ball, that allowed them to complete the run easily in the endWahab Riaz [8.0-0-35-4] is back into the attack
INDIA:46.6  Ajmal to Raina, 1 run, Raina goes back and turns it to square leg, three runs and a wicket for Ajmal off that over, excellent spell from him
INDIA:46.5  Ajmal to Zaheer, 1 run, flatter and quicker one, just dabbed to point off the frontfoot and a quick single takenZaheer Khan, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:46.4  Ajmal to Harbhajan, out Stumped!! That's worked, the mocking in the previous delivery has lured Harbhajan to come down the track and going for a big one, it was well flighted, Harbhajan was a long way down looking to go full monty, does not make any contact, the ball goes the other way, it was a doosra, Harbhajan just meets thin air and turns back only to find the ball in Kamran's gloves. Bails whipped, end of Harbhajan. Harbhajan st Kamran Akmal b Ajmal 12(15) [4s-2] Ajmal to Harbhajan, THATS OUT!!

INDIA:46.2  Ajmal to Raina, 1 run, fuller again, pushed down to long on
INDIA:46.1  Ajmal to Raina, no run, flatter and pushed through, Raina goes on the backfoot and punches it to the left of the bowler, Ajmal goes to his left and stops it, there was a chance of taking a single but Harbhajan is not a sharp runner between the wickets
INDIA:45.6  Gul to Harbhajan, no run, slower one from Gul, Harbhajan leans looking to go over mid off or extra cover, no contact made
INDIA:45.5  Gul to Harbhajan, FOUR!!, a full toss down the leg stump, Gul wanted to bowl a yorker but it goes horribly wrong, Harbhajan goes across and just uses the pace of the ball and tickles it to the fine leg boundary, gook the inside half of the bat but a piece of willow was all that the ball asked for, it got it and the scorecard says the restHarbhajan is having some problems behind the bowler's arm. Looks like that's been set and we are up and running again
INDIA:45.4  Gul to Raina, 1 run, well done! Uses his mind, he has already got a boundary earlier this over, just drills a fuller delivery on the off side towards mid off, pinches a single, and now it's up to Bhajji!Both third man and fine leg are inside the circle now. Afridi is talking to Gul after every delivery, long on and long off in place.
INDIA:45.3  Gul to Raina, FOUR!!, the little man is showing his class out here in front of all the Punjabi girls in the crowd, they love him! A low full toss outside off, Raina drives it through extra cover, excellent placement, good timing and that was all he needed
INDIA:45.2  Gul to Raina, no run, full toss on the leg stump, cracked straight back to the bowler, Afridi comes up to Gul and has a word or two, Gul has been off colour for sure
INDIA:45.2  Gul to Raina, wide, Gul is feeling the pressure, fuller and down the leg, wide called
INDIA:45.1  Gul to Raina, FOUR!!, beaut! Raina is starting to flex his muscles says Sanjay Manjrekar on air, gets underneath the fuller delivery and targets the safest region in the ground, straight over the bowler's head, a couple of bounces and into the sight-screenUmar Gul [6.0-0-45-0] is back into the attack. Is this the over to target?
INDIA:44.6  Ajmal to Raina, 1 run, well tossed up, Raina comes down the wicket and turns it to deep square leg for a single
INDIA:44.5  Ajmal to Raina, no run, wonderful fuller delivery, almost a yorker, Raina gets the bat down but can't squeeze it away
INDIA:44.5  Ajmal to Harbhajan, 2 wides, Ajmal gets one to pitch on middle and leg and turn further down, Harbhajan can't connect the sweep, Akmal can't collect the ball, ricochets to short fine leg and they take a single
INDIA:44.4  Ajmal to Harbhajan, FOUR!!, first boundary in 15 overs for India! Harbhajan sweeps and sweeps well, gets it wide of the man at short fine, he gets a boundary, much needed!
INDIA:44.3  Ajmal to Harbhajan, no run, Harbhajan pushes it to the on side towards mid on
INDIA:44.2  Ajmal to Harbhajan, no run, Harbhajan looks to sweep, goes off the glove to short third manDrama: Ajmal delivers the ball, and at the same time Raina drops his bat which distracts Harbhajan and he pulls off. The umpire signals it a dead ball, the Pakistanis have no clue why that was called a dead ball, wasn't their problem for sure
INDIA:44.1  Ajmal to Raina, 1 run, slower through the air, Raina goes back and clips it with soft hands, he called for two straight away, the fielder at deep square prevents the second run, Harbhajan wasn't ready to take any riskAlright, Raina is known to be aggressive. He reckons that he's got his eye in. The Batting Powerplay is taken! Gul was initially getting ready to bowl, but Afridi changes his mind, sticks to Ajmal. He knows that the batting powerplay can spell doom.
INDIA:43.6  Riaz to Harbhajan, no run, just five runs off that over, he changes the angle and gets the ball to come into Harbhajan from wide of the crease, Harbhajan can't work it away, goes off his pad to the on side, they don't take a single, Raina wants to be on strike for the next delivery
INDIA:43.5  Riaz to Raina, 1 run, fuller one, driven with the full face of the bat to long on for a single
INDIA:43.4  Riaz to Raina, no run, Edged! But folks, Kamran hasn't dropped it this time, it has fallen well short of him, Raina was looking to cut that away from the body, the ball does not bounce much, gets an under edge and it falls in front of Kamran Akmal who was lunging forward
INDIA:43.3  Riaz to Harbhajan, 1 run, pushed between point and cover off the frontfoot, they are happy to be dealing in singles at the moment
INDIA:43.3  Riaz to Harbhajan, wide, that's by far the worst delivery he has bowled today, runs in and bowls with a different action looking for the in swinger, gets it completely wrong, down the leg, wide called, and rightly so
INDIA:43.2  Riaz to Harbhajan, no run, good solid backfoot defense from Harbhajan! Short of a good length and around the off and middle, Harbhajan did well to get behind the line of the delivery completely and play it just under his chin
INDIA:43.2  Riaz to Harbhajan, wide, gets the line wrong, back of a length and going down the leg, wide signalled!
INDIA:43.1  Riaz to Harbhajan, 2 runs, plays this one off the backfoot, the un-orthodox backfoot wristy whip through mid wicket, Raina forces Harbhajan to come for the second, good running
INDIA:42.6  Ajmal to Raina, no run, Raina pushes it off the backfoot again, this time to cover, misunderstanding between the two batsmen in the middle, Raina wanted the single but Harbhajan didn't sends him back, the throw came in to the keeper who wipped the bails, Raina's acrobatic dive has saved him out here, stretched full length and made sure the bat was well groundedA run-out chance, Raina is in question. Third umpire called for, but Raina looks to be safe, the dive would have saved him.
INDIA:42.5  Ajmal to Raina, no run, Raina pushes off the backfoot to mid off
INDIA:42.4  Ajmal to Harbhajan, 1 run, Harbhajan decides to sweep at the last moment, the ball takes the top edge and falls short of the man at deep fine leg, the fielder was wide and was running towards the ball, safe!

INDIA:42.2  Ajmal to Raina, 1 run, turned off his pads behind square on the on side
INDIA:42.1 Ajmal to Raina, no run, a nice looking forward defense from Raina, it was tossed up to force Raina into the lofted shot, he does well
INDIA:41.6  Riaz to Harbhajan, no run, a play and a miss! Fuller and swinging away from Harbhajan, he does a bit of flirting with the ball, doesn't make contact
INDIA:41.5  Riaz to Harbhajan, no run, Harbhajan plays away from the body, pushes it to the man at point, good stop from the fielderHarbhajan Singh, right handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:41.4  Riaz to Dhoni, out Lbw!! Simon Taufel has got it spot on yet again, It was a wonderful delivery from Riaz, short of a good length, pitches on leg, raps Dhoni in front of middle and off as he misses the backfoot whip, his feet was in the air as he played at that delivery, but he was well behind the crease, the ball was going onto hit off, GONE! Dhoni lbw b Riaz 25(42) [4s-2] Riaz to Dhoni, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Is Dhoni going for the review? He has been given OUT! Yes, he opts for the review, he wasn't left with any other option. Pitched in line, hitting in line, the ball going onto hit the stumps. Is he Out? Yes!
INDIA:41.3  Riaz to Raina, 1 run, Raina goes back and clips it off his pads to deep square leg
INDIA:41.2 Riaz to Dhoni, 1 run, edged and dropped! That was wonderfully bowled by Riaz, angling away from Dhoni who played away from the body tentatively, a thickish outside edge went flying to the right of Kamran, he dives but butter fingers, he can't catch it, not surprising to me, after what we have seen all day from the Pakistani fielders
INDIA:41.1  Riaz to Dhoni, no run, Riaz has been their best bowler today, it is a boon for the captain, his strike bowler failed but the young gun Riaz hasn't disappointed him, back of a length and angled across, punched off the backfoot to extra coverWahab Riaz [6.0-0-27-3] is back into the attack
INDIA:40.6  Ajmal to Raina, no run, trifle short, Raina goes back and punches it to mid off, straight to the fielder though

INDIA:40.1  Ajmal to Dhoni, 1 run, Dhoni gets an inside edge to square legThanks Srivathsa, for both the sarcasm and for handing over comm. Alright, here we go!Time for Ajith to finish off things. The Indian innings that is. Me, Srivathsa will take a break.
INDIA:39.6  Afridi to Dhoni, 1 run, driven down to long off, retains the strike with that run
INDIA:39.5  Afridi to Dhoni, no run, Realtime Thiru is on fire as he says it is not-out on first glance, not-out it is, the inside edge saved DhoniAfridi only takes the review off his own bowling. And he takes it again. Despite Dhoni telling him that it took the bat. A big inside nick. Taufel said no. Afridi thought about it. After it was shown on the big screen then he changed his mind and took it. Pak have lost it - the review I meant.

And who else but the charismatic Afridi who takes the catch. A very strange Tendulkar innings has finally come to an end. Driven hard, but straight to Boom Boom at cover, he failed to keep it down and Afridi takes a low catch well. He celebrates with both his arms raised - trade-mark Afridi! All the Pakistanis come and hug him. The crowd have gone completely silent. Well deserved wicket for Ajmal. Tendulkar c Afridi b Ajmal 85(115) [4s-11] Ajmal to Tendulkar, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

INDIA:34.5  Hafeez to Tendulkar, no run, Kamran Akmal almost forces Afridi to go for a ridiculous review, in the end better sense prevails, Tendulkar was way down the wicket and was caught on the pad, hit outside the line of off and no way in the world that was out

BOD goes to him. The crowd have gone quiet, then mad in the space of two balls. Could it be SRT's day?, might well be.Drama, as now the third ump has been called for a stumping chance. Once again Tendulkar might get away, Billy Bowden is the third ump, Munna Moosa Patel smiles whole-heartedly. Hear the roar now says Sourav to Sanjay. Nerves jangling.

The roar at Mohali summarises the importance of the man. Ian Gould shakes his head. He saw that on the big screen and didn't like it. To be honest, I thought Tendulkar was out, when I saw it first.

INDIA:6.2  Gul to Gambhir, 1 run, Gambhir goes on the backfoot and steers it with an open face down to third man
INDIA:6.1  Gul to Gambhir, no run, suddenly the wicket of Sehwag has pepped up Gul, beats Gambhir on the angle, it seamed away past the attempted forward prod and was close to the edge
INDIA:5.6  Riaz to Gambhir, 1 run, to mid on, softly tapped wide of short mid, takes the single and gets off the markGautam Gambhir, left handed bat, comes to the crease
INDIA:5.5  Riaz to Sehwag, out Lbw!! Monstrous wicket that for Pakistan and the bowling change has worked. Sehwag was hopping on the backfoot to whip that away, it pitched on middle and went past his waft, would've taken out middle. Good decision that from Taufel. The Pakistani contigent in the crowd go ballistic. India lose a review. Sehwag did not even ask Tendulkar and went for the review, he thought that it might have pitched outside leg, it didn't. The nippy pace of Riaz has got Sehwag out. Sehwag lbw b Riaz 38(25) [4s-9] Riaz to Sehwag, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Sehwag has asked for a review, he has been given out LBW. Taufel is the ump. The crowd have gone silent. Did it pitch outside leg? Sehwag immediately went for the review.

INDIA:5.1  Riaz to Tendulkar, no run, angled across on a good length, Tendulkar watches it and then lets it go, a sighter first up for TendulkarWahab Riaz, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attackRiaz comes on. Aplogies for not introducing Realtime Thiru who is on scoring. The trusted duo are once again bringing you the proceedings.
INDIA:4.6  Gul to Sehwag, FOUR!!, Sehwag is jumping, hopping and wants to hit every ball to the fence, short and wide outside off, poor delivery by Gul, Sehwag had to reach out a little, did and hit it over point's head, the razor fast outfield does the rest
INDIA:4.5  Gul to Sehwag, no run, good ball, the surprise short delivery, Gul has attempted it for the first time and Sehwag ducks
INDIA:4.4  Gul to Sehwag, FOUR!!, Sehwag looks unstoppable today, middle stump half volley, Sehwag goes deep back into his crease and flicks it past mid wicket, there are 3 men on the on side, but none had a chance as the ball screamed to the fence
INDIA:4.3  Gul to Sehwag, no run, fraction short outside off, Sehwag went on the backfoot and punched it to Umar at backward point
INDIA:4.2  Gul to Sehwag, no run, Ravi Shaz calls it a national highway, while Ramiz Rambo reckons it is a concrete slab, they are referring to the Mohali wicket as Sehwag unveils a rock solid defence off the front-foot, eyes under the ball and blocking
INDIA:4.1  Gul to Sehwag, no run, short of length delivery on off stump, Sehwag gets right behind the line and defends well
INDIA:3.6  Razzaq to Tendulkar, FOUR!!, Gorgeous!, What a master-ful stroke that is, my colleague, Sid V says it is already bringing back the memories of Centurion 03, beautiful extra cover drive, pierced the gap between cover and Afridi didn't dive to his left at mid off, Tendulkar will get his first boundary
INDIA:3.5  Razzaq to Tendulkar, no run, good length delivery on off stump, Tendulkar defends solidly
INDIA:3.4  Razzaq to Sehwag, 1 run, flicked down to fine leg
INDIA:3.3  Razzaq to Sehwag, FOUR!!, no swing nor there is any seam, Gary Kirsten and Eric Simons watch the ball fly to the fence, Sehwag got forward, it was on a good length on off, just belted it straight back over the head of Razzaq, one bounce over the ropes, almost went all the way, looks like Sehwag has decided to hit the leather of the ball
INDIA:3.2  Razzaq to Sehwag, no run, fuller length delivery outside off, Sehwag drives, but straight to the fielder at cover
INDIA:3.1  Razzaq to Tendulkar, 3 runs, all touch, class and elegance from Tendulkar who I reckon will play the sheet-anchor today, opens the face of the bat and deftly steers it past point, good running will bring them 3
INDIA:2.6  Gul to Sehwag, no run, some damage control as Gul bowls that well, with a lot of pace and followed Sehwag who was trying to heave it to leg, inside edged it onto his boot
INDIA:2.6  Gul to Sehwag, no ball, FOUR!!, Carnage has started at Mohali, what's worse for Gul and Pakistan is the fact that it is a no-ball and a free hit will be coming up, a regulation half volley has been emphatically thrashed off the front-foot, planted his foot forward and cracked it hard, Gul walks back with a disconsolate look on his face
INDIA:2.5  Gul to Sehwag, FOUR!!, Sehwag says ok, 3 on the on side, I will have one on the off as well, the crowd are dancing in the isles, back of the hand slower delivery, too short and too wide outside off, Sehwag arches back and carves it past point, 4 boundaries in the over, Gul is under massive pressure, Afridi though keeps egging him on
INDIA:2.4  Gul to Sehwag, FOUR!!, Sehwag will hit you all day, so will Tendulkar if anyone bowls there, drifting in all the time into the pads, Sehwag closes the face of the bat and then gently wrists it to the right of the square leg ump, deep fine had no chance, Sehwag is away and so are India, Gul and Pak under pressure
INDIA:2.3  Gul to Sehwag, no run, this time Sehwag turns it straight to the fielder at square leg
INDIA:2.2  Gul to Sehwag, FOUR!!, again, Gul knows it, Afridi is pointing out to Gul to swing the ball away from Sehwag after that ball went to the fence, he is telling Gul not to bring it in, a good delivery, but Sehwag is so good that he goes on the backfoot and whips the short of length delivery on middle past the vacant square leg region, consecutive boundaries and a little kid in the crowd are smiles
INDIA:2.1  Gul to Sehwag, FOUR!!, too easy for Sehwag, Raina and Co. in the dressing room are chuffed, all the fielders are on the off side and Gul errs by bowling it fuller on the pads, flicked away with disdain over square leg
INDIA:1.6  Razzaq to Tendulkar, no run, Tendulkar stands tall and defends with an open face to the off side
INDIA:1.5  Razzaq to Sehwag, 1 run, punched wide of a diving Asad Shafiq at cover, Sehwag will take the single
INDIA:1.4  Razzaq to Tendulkar, 1 run, Tendulkar gets off the mark with a tight single, pushed off the backfoot to the right of Riaz at mid on, he was in as the throw missed, reminiscent to the way he got off the mark against SL in the 2003 WC, that time Jayasuriya missed, similar shot, similar result
INDIA:1.3  Razzaq to Tendulkar, no run, solid forward defence from Tendulkar to a a tight delivery on off stump
INDIA:1.2  Razzaq to Tendulkar, no run, signs of variable bounce? or is it the lack of pace from Razzaq, that one stood a bit low, Tendulkar tried to punch it on the up, the ball stopped on Tendulkar and caught the inner half of the bat, before it went back to Razzaq
INDIA:1.1  Razzaq to Tendulkar, no run, ambles in and lands it on a good length on off stump, Tendulkar gets forward and softly wrists it down to mid onAbdul Razzaq, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackRazzaq has the new ball. He used to trouble Sachin a lot during the VB series in 1999. Maybe this is a psychological move from the Pakistanis to give him the new nut. A slip in place for him.
INDIA:0.6  Gul to Sehwag, no run, short of length and rising from that length, Sehwag gets right behind the line and defends right under his eyes
INDIA:0.5  Gul to Sehwag, no run, another good drive, but Pakistan have that region plugged now, cover driven straight to the fielder at cover pointNow Sehwag is unhappy that someone moved behind Gul's arm. He waves his left hand and asks the guy to move away.
INDIA:0.4  Gul to Sehwag, no run, good comeback from Gul, on a short of length and moving away after pitching, Sehwag tried to punch it on the up, it beat his bat and went to Kamran, there is definite swing for Gul
INDIA:0.3  Gul to Sehwag, FOUR!!, Sehwag gets off the mark with yet another boundary four in this WC, in all the games that he has played so far, he has done that, fabulous shot, driven on the up past cover, moved across to off and then a caressed drive, all along the carpet, the ball screams away, looks a very fast outfield this
INDIA:0.2  Gul to Sehwag, no run, in the channel outside off, left alone, no swing or seam movement for Gul that time
INDIA:0.1  Gul to Sehwag, no run, Sehwag was surprised that it was not called a wide, went after a swinging out swinger, reached out and tried to square drive, missed, it nestled in Kamran's gloves, who appealed for a caught behind, but Gul is lucky that he got awaySehwag and Tendulkar are at the crease. Sehwag is on strike. Gul will open the attackThe Pakistani team are in a huddle. Out come the Indian openers. Sachin gets a massive roar from the crowd. What's new you might say. Umar Gul - the potent weapon for Pakistan is at the top of his mark. A couple of slips in place for him. Here we go. Let the game begin!National Anthems: First up is the Pakistani one. After that is the Indian anthem and as it ends, a huge roar goes up at Mohali. Right now, both the prime-ministers of India and Pakistan are shaking hands with both the sides' players. Before that, Sachin was having a few things to say to his batting partner Sehwag - who was all ears.Thanks Ajith. Huge. Humongous. Monstrous. All the adjectives in the English dictionary won't be enough to describe this game. It's such a big occasion - a political one too - as Manmohan Singh the Indian Prime Minister and Yusuf Raza Gilani, the Pakistan Prime Minister are in attendance. Aamir Khan along with his wife Kiran Rao are in the crowd. Lots of celebrities will be in today. Sonia Gandhi along with her son, Rahul are there too.Alright, it's that kind of a day where even an atheist believes more in superstitions than his common sense. Can't blame it, as I said, it's that kind of a day. And we have a bit of superstitions doing the rounds in the office. Me, Ajith, will hand over comm duties to Srivathsa. Will be back after a while. Hoping to see a good game.Teams:Pakistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Hafeez, Kamran Akmal(w), Asad Shafiq, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shahid Afridi(c), Umar Akmal, Wahab Riaz, Abdul Razzaq, Umar Gul, Saeed AjmalIndia (Playing XI): Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Suresh Raina, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Ashish NehraAfridi: The wicket is good, but I don't think the toss will matter too much. The boys are confident, the team dressing room atmosphere is good. As a captain, it is a big game for me. I am going in with the same side.MS Dhoni: We would like to bat first, it is a good track, we'll bat first and put the pressure on the opposition. The most critical day was the travelling day, we could not get a direct flight. We had two good days of practice, first day we played football and volley ball and the next day we did our fielding drills. In place of Ashwin, Nehra is playing.  Pakistan are good players of spin bowling, and that's why we wanted more options to manoeuvere in terms of pace.India have won the toss and elected to batTime for the toss, and there is a rumour doing the rounds that Nehra is replacing Ashwin. Is it true? Dhoni will confirm it at the toss, Ravi Shastri, surprisingly, isn't shouting!1:54 PM IST - Six minutes to go for the toss Pitch report:: The wicket is well rolled, the cracks haven't moved at all. There could be a little bit of pace and some movement under the lights. The team winning the toss would like to bat first, 300 will be achievable feels Sourav Ganguly.Weather report: Max temperature : 32 deg. Hot and humid with plenty of sunshine.1:30 PM IST: Just wanted to remind you all - 30 minutes to go for the toss. Nothing more!Rameez Raja says the Pakistani team management are not all that confident about Shoaib Akhtar. He says they would want a fitter bowler who can bowl better in the second and third spells and he reckons Akhtar does not fit into the scheme of things. Sanjay Manjrekar adds: I had a chat with Waqar Younis and he confirmed the fact that Akhtar won't feature in today's game.Shoaib Akhtar is out there sweating it out in the practice drills. Have they kept him aside just to keep him fresh for this epic clash? The Indians shouldn't worry, there was this same hype about him in the 2003 World Cup game, but Sachin Tendulkar made sure that the fears were put to rest.won123 writes in: On 31st March 2001 Sachin Tendulkar became the first person to score 10,000 runs in ODIs. Ten years later, on the 30th of March 2011, will he be the first one to score 100 International tons?A piece of stat from Mohali: Of the 15 day night matches played in Mohali, the team batting first has won the game on 10 occasions. India have played 8 day night games in Mohali, they have a win percentage of 50. India and Pakistan have played twice in Mohali, and on both occasions, Pakistan came up victorious. Will it change today?On one side there is a Shahid Afridi who is the highest wicket taker so far in the World Cup having taken 21 wickets. There is a Yuvraj Singh on the other side who has been devastating both with the bat and the ball, he has also been the Man of the Match on 4 occasions in the 2011 World Cup. Don't write Virender Sehwag off. He hasn't fired as he would have wanted to, but today may just be his day. What about Akhtar, are they gonna play him?Among the current players in the Indian side, Sachin Tendulkar is the only bowler to have taken a five wicket haul against Pakistan in ODIs. He took 5/50 in an ODI in 2005 at Kochi. And remember, Sachin Tendulkar got his first World Cup fifty against Pakistan, the unbeaten 54 in 1992.Stat Buzz: Sachin and Sehwag, when they walk out to bat today, will become the only openers for India to have opened the batting against Pakistan in successive WC games coming after a gap of 8 years. Sachin Tendulkar is the only player to have featured in all four World Cup wins against Pakistan.12:00 PM IST, Mohali - India vs Pakistan: Words can't tell you how big this game is, and the build up is such that you just can't ignore it. It's time for cricket to bring the world to a standstill, brace yourselves folks, the rivalry is all set to unravel again. Yes, there has been some rain in Mohali, but let me make it clear - the sun is beating hard and we are all set for a cracker of an encounter. As always, this is Ajith bringing you all the action. I will also be joined by Sid V and Srivathsa. Yes, we have two more hours to go for the toss, but we can't wait until then. The show kicks off here, we'll have plenty of updates coming your way. Before I add anything more, I would like to welcome each one of you to the ultimate carnival of cricket.Preview by Saurabh SomaniThere are blockbusters and there are blockbusters. An India-Pakistan match in normal circumstances qualifies as one. But when it's in the semi-finals of a World Cup that is held in the sub-continent; that is the most watched in history - then it's somewhat bland to describe the match as simply a blockbuster. We'll search for the appropriate words later.
There is no point in saying that this is 'just another match' and the players and fans ought to treat it as such. The fans will never treat it as such, which in turn means the players will never be allowed to treat it as such. It will be about India's batting versus Pakistan's bowling - and it will also be about India's bowling versus Pakistan's batting - but more than anything else, it will be about who handles the pressure better.
New Zealand showed that application and commitment, when allied with pressure, do strange things. South Africa were felled, and Sri Lanka were given the jitters. If a team that is so much shorter on raw ability than India or Pakistan can induce such panic, there is no telling what a choke applied by a more skillful set of players would do.Batting vs BowlingIn the build up of India's batsmen and Pakistan's bowlers, one equally important battle has been overlooked: that between India's bowlers and Pakistan's batsmen. (Both sets of fielders are equally good/bad on most days). Pakistan's batting line-up revolves largely around Umar Akmal and Misbah ul Haq, and while those two have been good, they haven't yet been spectacular. India's bowling often seems to start and end with Zaheer Khan. Zaheer has been spectacular, but none of the others have given the impression that they could turn the match on their own. The Indian batting vs Pakistan bowling will be a battle to see who is stronger. The Indian bowling vs Pakistan batting will be one to see who is less weak. In a crunch match such as this, the second battle is as important as the first one. [A detailed and more in-depth look at the numbers of the Indian and Pakistani players has been provided in this analysis.]
The first battle will rely heavily on the respective starters. Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag versus Umar Gul and Shoaib Akhtar - who Pakistan should include given his love of the big stage and proven ability to perform - will be a mouth-watering clash. Even more, it will be a clash whose outcome will give the side that wins it a huge advantage. Just like India can point at a deep batting line-up that can still threaten in case the openers fail, so too can Pakistan point to a varied and penetrating bowling attack, that can still strike if the opening bowlers fail.The Game Changers:Whatever be the outcome of this match, one thing is fairly certain: If Pakistan win, Shahid Afridi will go on to get the Man of the Series award, and if India win, Yuvraj Singh will collect the honours. Both perform symmetrically opposite roles for their teams - they are their team's go-to men in the middle overs for batting and bowling respectively. Both have brought a second skill to the table and been very successful at it too: Yuvraj with his bowling and Afridi with his captaincy. Yuvraj may not be the best purveyor of flight and loop, just as Afridi may not be the most tactically astute captain - but Yuvraj has cunning, the ability to deceive and discipline, while Afridi has the ability to unite a team famous for quarreling among themselves often more than with the opposition. Both have looked like men on a mission in this tournament. The steely-eyed determination is visible in Yuvraj everytime he has walked out and bailed the team out of a tight situation, and Afridi's fierce desire to win is on display everytime Pakistan have played.
They are running neck-and-neck with each other in the performance stakes. One of them will pull away at Mohali.The Conditions:There was considerable flutter after heavy overnight rains in Chandigarh and Mohali, but all weather reports have predicted a sunny day on 30th March. The pitch is very much a bat-first wicket, though dew is a considration. However, the ground staff will use chemicals to keep the outfield dry. Moreover, if there is cloud cover, the chances of dew are supposed to decrease, while lending the ball additional zip in the latter half of the day. The conditions definitely point to the side winning the toss batting first. What both teams must tell themselves though, is that winning the World Cup requires a team to be able to beat both opponents and odds - and that the match, or even the advantage is not lost if the toss is lost.The Teams:The rains are likely to have caused last-minute changes in both camps. India's batting will remain unchanged barring a late injury, with Raina having conclusively stolen a march over Yusuf Pathan after the quarter-final against Australia. Their bowling though - more specifically the identity of the man who will share the new ball with Zaheer - is still uncertain. None of Munaf, Nehra or Sreesanth have lit the stands on fire with their performances so far, and going in with any one of them will be a gamble. The think-tank is likely to go with the bowler who has shown the best rhythm in the nets, while taking into account the fact that the bowler in question needs to be mentally strong for the pressures that such a match brings.
Pakistan's main dilemma is whether to include Shoaib Akhtar over Wahab Riaz. Akhtar is a proven match-winner, but hasn't had the the best recent form. Moreover, he does not inspire 100% confidence of getting through 10 full overs. The other question for Pakistan is on whether Saeed Ajmal will get a game or not. Pakistan could opt for Afridi as the lone spinner, with a pace heavy attack, but if they go with two spinners, it will be Ajmal competing with Abdur Rehman for a spot.The Verdict:The concept of favourites has not really worked all the time in this World Cup, and in this match, it will matter even less who is stronger on paper. It will matter even less that India has never beaten Pakistan at Mohali or that Pakistan have never beaten India in a World Cup. Such records are meaningless except in posterity.
What will matter is who among the twenty two players will be able to seize the moment. Who will be able to turn the flow of the match - as Sachin Tendulkar memorably did in 2003 - and to recognize that cricketing immortality lies in the moment thus seized: with one shot magically played, one over perfectly bowled, one catch breath-takingly caught.
Blockbuster is too mild a word. It's going to be epic.
