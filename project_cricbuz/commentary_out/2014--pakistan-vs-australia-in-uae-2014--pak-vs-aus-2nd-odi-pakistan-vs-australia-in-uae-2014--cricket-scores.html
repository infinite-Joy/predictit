Hoping to put up a good score. We are bringing in Doherty in place of Sean Abbott."Misbah-ul-Haq: "We will bat first. It looks a dry pitch and we might get more turn in the later half. We got one change - Raza Hasan is back for Anwar Ali. I think Sarfraz played well in the last game. We will be looking for the same opening partners. It is really important for us to get runs on the board."Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to batPitch Report: "It is a beautiful wicket, same as what was used for the T20I. It is flat and quite hard. It will favour the spinners more. It is a 225-230 kind of a pitch. It will all depend on the spinners and team selection will be important. Teams should go for an extra spinner. Win the toss and bat first," reckons Dean Jones.Dean Jones has tweeted: Same pitch as used in the T20 match.... Which means a low scoring match guys. #nosheen #turnerOn the other hand, Australia have done well to assert their dominance at the beginning of the series. They put up a competitive 255 in the first ODI and backed it up with terrific bowling. They have an all-round team - a power-packed batting line-up coupled with a disciplined bowling attack. A win today will seal the 3-match ODI series for them. Will Pakistan be able to stay alive in the competition? Join us in a short while for the toss and team updates. Stay tuned...Pakistan have had a poor tour so far. After big losses in the one-off T20I and the first ODI, they will have to come up with a much improved performance to register their first win in the series. Although Misbah agreed that ODIs are a different format, Pakistan's batting suffered another terrible collapse while playing at Sharjah on Tuesday. What's worse is that Misbah's own form has not been able to inspire the team to fight back.PreviewAfter suffering humiliating losses in the only T20I and the first ODI, Pakistan will have to punch above their weight to overcome the stiff challenge from Australia. In both their games till now, Pakistan's batsmen were sent back to the pavilion like an army of sheep by Australia's crunching bowling unit.AustraliaTo win a game of cricket, one needs to have wicket-taking bowlers and Australia certainly have a deep reservoir of fine bowlers. Mitchell Johnson, Kane Richardson and company can take wickets upfront. Nathan Lyon too has shown that he can make crucial breakthroughs.In fact, Lyon with subtle variations of drift and cunningness brings back memories of spinners from yore, who believed in beating the batsman with flight and guile. In short, Lyon belongs to the traditional school of Australian spin bowling, as he pitches it outside the off-stump, spins it hard and tempts the batsman to drive.Of course, with the likes of David Warner, Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell, Steven Smith and George Bailey in their ranks, they have the batsmen to notch up monstrous scores on the board.However, the captain, Bailey, hasn't exactly been in fine form in recent times.It also has to be said that tracks in UAE are on the slower side, and it is tough to hit on the up and through the line of the ball. In their first game, only Smith showcased that he has the ability to play spin well. It is up to other batsmen to follow in his footsteps and adjust to the conditions on view. On expected lines, Australia's fielding has been sharp and up to the mark.PakistanPakistan's batting woes continues to act as a hurdle. The track at Sharjah wasn't some treacherous or unplayable deck, but for the umpteenth time, Pakistan's batsmen fell like nine pins when facing up to a fine bowling attack.The likes of Ahmed Shehzad, Asad Shafiq, Misbah-ul-Haq, Fawad Alam and Umar Akmal have to show a significant improvement in their defence to come good. Remember, they are playing in familiar conditions yet, they have been below par.On the plus side, the pacers, Wahab Riaz and especially, the towering giant, Mohammad Irfan, were impressive. Irfan, with the kind of bounce he generates will always be a threat. Even Zulfiqar Babar, the slow left-arm orthodox, bowled with good control.Quotes:It's not a good start to the series. We have to work a lot on our batting. We have to do a lot of things, the batsmen are not getting the big scores and it is a worry for us. You need to be positive all the time and forget the previous game and comeback strongly:Misbah-ul-Haq, Pakistan's skipper.Very pleased. I thought we were 15-20 runs short, but the bowlers did a fantastic job. The pitch got slower and our spinners were excellent. Smith and Warner provided us a good start. Mitch (Johnson) is fresh and ready to go for the next game: George Bailey.Teams:Australia (From): Aaron Finch, David Warner, Steven Smith, George Bailey(c), Glenn Maxwell, James Faulkner, Brad Haddin(w), Sean Abbott, Mitchell Johnson, Kane Richardson, Nathan Lyon, Xavier Doherty, Mitchell Starc, Phillip HughesPakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Asad Shafiq, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Fawad Alam, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Anwar Ali, Wahab Riaz, Zulfiqar Babar, Mohammad Irfan, Raza Hasan, Sohaib Maqsood, Umar Amin, Junaid KhanLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
