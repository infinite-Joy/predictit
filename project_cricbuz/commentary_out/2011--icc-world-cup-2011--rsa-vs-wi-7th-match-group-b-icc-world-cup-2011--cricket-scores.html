Benn will open the attackTahir: I want to thank God, glad that I performed well. It is important to vary the pace, and I concentrated on that. The players supported each other, and that's what matters when you are playing in such a big tournament. Hoping to continue the same for the rest of the tournament.It has been memorable outing for the Bravo brothers and Imran Tahir. If playing with 3 spinners was a surprise, Smith shocked everyone by throwing the new ball to Botha. The shock resulted in the early exit of the dangerous Gayle. In walked Darren Bravo to show why is is rated so high by the great Brian Lara. Some beautiful shots flew out of his bat and reminded everyone of the legend himself. Just when the Windies batsmen looked set, the SA spinners came on to choke the middle order. Johan Botha gave the big blow by dismissing Darren Bravo. Devon Smith and Ramnaresh Sarwan soon followed, falling to debutant Imran Tahir and leaving it to Chanderpaul and Dwayne Bravo to rebuild. The duo did that well, with Bravo doing the attacking and Chanderpaul supporting him. A horror mix up led to Bravo's dismissal and what followed was a procession from the lower middle order. The Proteas' move to fill their team with spinners paid off big time as Tahir and Botha shared 6 wickets between them. The WI have managed to put on a decent total on board, but will this be enough against the mighty batting line up of the South Africans? Join us in 40 minutes to find out.4

WEST INDIES:6.2  Morne Morkel to Smith, no run, as soon as I type that, he angles one in and this rises a tad and strikes Smith on the thigh guard, going well down the leg side though
WEST INDIES:6.1  Morne Morkel to Darren Bravo, 1 run, short of length and delivered from round the wicket, Darren Bravo defends wide of mid wicket, and turns the strike over, will be interesting to see how Morne Morkel goes on this wicket, he won't get much of the steepling bounce that he would get back homeMorne Morkel, right-arm fast, comes into the attackA slip in place for Morkel and we have the first bowling change of this match.
WEST INDIES:5.6  Steyn to Smith, no run, back of a length and straightening on middle stump, Smith is an opening batter in test matches and he knows how to deal with those, gets right behind the line and blocks compactly

WEST INDIES:5.3  Steyn to Darren Bravo, no run, slower one on off stump, Darren Bravo hangs back and blocks

WEST INDIES:5.1  Steyn to Darren Bravo, no run, back of a length and banged in hard into the pitch, on middle, Darren Bravo is deep into his crease and defendsWe have seen this so many times - once more please as there is a slight delay in play because of sight-screen issues.

WEST INDIES:4.3  Botha to Darren Bravo, no run, leans forward and defends the leg stump ball
WEST INDIES:4.2  Botha to Smith, 1 run, tapped off the backfoot to mid on and Smith is a little late in setting off, would have been interesting to see what would have happened if Morne Morkel had hit
WEST INDIES:4.1  Botha to Smith, FOUR!!, Wonderful shot and Botha grimaces, Smith created his own room and played the late cut to perfection, it was pushed through and hurrying onto him, but he arched back and cut it wide and to the right of the diving fielder, beating him easily
WEST INDIES:3.6  Steyn to Darren Bravo, no run, well flicked down to square leg, but can't find the gap

WEST INDIES:3.3  Steyn to Darren Bravo, no run, Steyn tried the cutter and the ball stopped on the Kotla pitch, is it a sign of the variable bounce that we are going to see as the game goes on?

Beautiful bowling too, after darting in the first couple of balls, he slowed this up and tossed it up on off stump, drew Gayle forward, the ball spun away a tad and Gayle edged it to slip, Kallis bent low and took an easy catch. Botha and Smith are dellighted. A massive blow for WI. Gayle c Kallis b Botha 2(3) Botha to Gayle, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
WEST INDIES:0.2  Botha to Gayle, 2 runs, down the leg side and tucked away to deep mid wicket, for a couple, Gayle is off the mark and the West Indies are away
WEST INDIES:0.1  Botha to Gayle, no run, A clear strategy this from the Proteas, they reckon that Botha is the man to get Gayle out, a far cry from the days when we used to White Lightning - Allan Donald steaming in, Botha comes round the wicket and drifts one in quicker, Gayle defends with bat close to the padGayle and Smith are at the crease. Gayle is on strike. Botha will open the attackA lot depends on Chris Gayle, if he fires then the Proteas will be in big big trouble. It looks very hazy and muggy at the Kotla. Devon Smith is more of an orthodox player and would play more of the sheet anchor's role. We are all set to go as the players walk out to the middle. This is Srivathsa, who will be bringing you the first 16 overs or so.National anthems: Interesting to see that when the West Indian national anthem is being played not one player is seen singing it. Perhaps they do not know the lyrics or something but really strange to see that. Maybe the reason is that the West Indies are a confederation of 7 different nations and come together as a unit to play under one common side only in the game of cricket. On the other hand, when the South African anthem is being played, everyone are singing except Kallis - who never believes in that concept and I have never seen him sing even once.Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Graeme Smith(c), Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers(w), Jean-Paul Duminy, Faf du Plessis, Johan Botha, Robin Peterson, Imran Tahir, Dale Steyn, Morne MorkelWest Indies (Playing XI): Chris Gayle, Devon Smith, Darren Bravo, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Darren Sammy(c), Devon Thomas(w), Sulieman Benn, Kemar RoachSouth Africa have won the toss and elected to fieldAB de Villiers: We are well prepared, we are focusing on our own game and we know that we have the ability to go far ahead in the tournament. We are playing West Indies who are a bit unpredictable at times. It used to be my home ground, I do know the wicket quite well. We have prepared accordingly and we would want to go about it in the right way.Sammy: We are quite happy to bat first, the guys in the team have made my job very easy. Everybody is fit, it was a hard XI to come up with but in the end, we have come up with the best possible XI.Smith: It would have been a good toss to lose, we want to bowl first. There will be a bit of dew tonight, and we would want to chase. We have had 9 days since our last warm up game. The guys are all excited and here we are. West Indies are a very competitive side, they have a few world class players. The wicket will be an unknown factor, we are going in with 3 spinners.Pitch report: We have had no international cricket here since December 2009. The ICC pitch advisor was here working with the local groundsmen, there is a tinge of grass on the wicket. The ball will do a bit early on but it will be a very good batting wicket.Gayle: This is an important game, but I will try not to take any pressure. I will go out and be myself, the last time I played here in Delhi, I got a lot of runs. Hopefully I can get the right start and put the team in the winning position. We want to come out victorious today. We need to back our strengths and enjoy the moment.Weather update: It is a bit hazy in Delhi, a nice cool breeze blowing and it will help the players. The sun is playing hide and seek, but there is no threat of rain. The temperature is around 23 degrees and it will get lesser and lesser as the day progresses.After 6 games involving minnows, we are here for the first big game of the tournament, South Africa take on the dark horses West Indies at the Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi. A warm welcome to all you cricket lovers. Big hitters in Gayle, Pollard and Bravo on one side and big names like Kallis, Smith and de Villiers on the other; this surely promises to be a crackerjack of a contest. Will Dayle Steyn prove to be the difference between the two sides? Or will West Indies, led by Sammy, play to their potentials and kick start their campaign with a win? This is Ajith taking you through the day along with Karthik, Sid V and Srivathsa. Don't go anywhere, more updates to come your way.Preview by Saurabh SomaniAfter a slew of matches were established teams took on minnows and a slew of correspondingly one-sided results, the World Cup 2011 will get its first heavyweight clash when South Africa take on the West Indies. The fact that the match will be played at the relaid FerozeShah Kotla pitch gives an added element to it.
The Kotla saw an India-Sri Lanka ODI being infamously abandoned in December 2009, but reports indicate that the slumbering DDCA was embarrassed by the episode and has put in some hard work towards ensuring that the relaid pitch receives no complaints from any quarter. DDCA vice-president and former India batsman Chetan Chauhan was quietly confident of the new track but added an element of caution, saying, "I am not overly concerned but I will be able to sleep peacefully only after Thursday."
Whether Chauhan sleeps peacefully or not, the winners of the first heavyweight clash of the World Cup will definitely sleep a lot more peacefully after Thursday. With the minnows not really pulling their weight - apart from the Ryan ten Doeschate inspired Netherlands show against England - the matches between the established teams assume even greater significance, and will determine the final standings of the teams for the quarter-finals.Team NewsSouth Africa: South Africa are amongst the hot favourites for the title and justly so. With a top-order batting comprising Smith, Amla, Kallis, and AB de Villiers, and a bowling attack led by the redoubtable Dale Steyn and the fiery Morne Morkel, they pack enough match-winners to make all opposition wary of them. Their results in the ODI format too have been very consistent, and that is reflected in their ranking. The big question for South Africa will be the composition of their bowling attack. Johan Botha is their first choice spinner, and with Steyn and Morkel certain to play, it leaves one spot up for grabs. Lonwabo Tsotsobe will be a strong contender for that spot, but against his claims are those of the much talked about Imran Tahir. While Tsotsobe was preferred in conditions where seamers had more assistance, on the pitches of the subcontinent, South Africa will seriously consider going in with a spinner to partner Botha, and in that case Tahir could well be the man they turn to. They will also have the part-time spin of JP Duminy to bank on. South Africa's choice of the final playing eleven could well give an indication of how they plan to approach the rest of the tournament. It is essential for South Africa to start the Cup on a winning note, if only to drown the inevitable questions of their infamous choking.West Indies: If this World Cup was happening 30 years ago, the West Indies would have been the undisputed kings of world cricket, and unquestioned favourites in the tournament. The passing of the decades has, however, dulled the lustre from the men from the Caribbean and West Indies is no longer the force it once was. However, they do have a side that boast of players who can take on the best in the world and come out on top. The Bravos - Dwayne and Darren - who have already made World Cup ambitions clear, Chris Gayle who is as destructive as they come, Chanderpaul and Sarwan, and the game-changing Kieron Pollard form a pretty impressive core group of players under captain Darren Sammy. The West Indies' recent problems have not been with the quality of their players but more with the inconsistency with which the quality is displayed. They need their main players to pull together, and perform well as a team rather than individually. That they are capable of it is not in doubt, and if they put it across South Africa, it will mean a giant step in that direction.Face off: Dale Steyn vs Chris Gayle and Kieron PollardDale Steyn has been the unquestioned leader of the bowling world in Test cricket, and is well on the way to being an all-time great, but he hasn't quite replicated that success in ODIs. However, he remains South Africa's most potent threat with the ball. In the IPL and the Champions League, Steyn worked over Pollard beautifully with well directed short balls that rendered the big Trinidadian strokeless. With Pollard and Gayle being the West Indies' prime big-hitting batsmen, and Steyn being South Africa's prime strike bowler, they are sure to face-off. Both Pollard and Gayle have played in three ODI matches against Steyn, and have had the upper hand against him. Steyn has not dismissed either of them in ODIs, and neither has been particularly successful in stemming the flow of runs from their bats. Gayle has taken 32 runs off 34 balls faced from Steyn, while Pollard has taken 24 off 24. Both are not men to back down from a fight, and Dale Steyn is not a man who takes kindly to batsmen dominating him. The mini-battles within the match would make for almost as fascinating a viewing as the match itself.Quotes:"The fans want to see that fight, that passion we had back in the 80s. We have to go out and execute properly - so that the fans who would be waking up early in the morning could be happy with our performances" - West Indies captain Darren Sammy.
"Tactically we have got our ideas about how we would like to set up in this tournament. We have covered every base there and we are really excited to get going" - South Africa captain Graeme Smith.
