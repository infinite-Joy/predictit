INDIA:48.2 48.2Kulasekara to Dhoni, SIX!!, India are World Champions!, A nation of a billion will sleep well tonight. What a shot to end the game. Yuvraj can't control his emotions. He is in tears. Sachin runs in from the dressing room and is mobbed. What marvellous scenes in Mumbai. Dhoni got under the length ball and absolutely hammered that out of sight and out of the park. The White Kookaburra soared over the fence. Bhajji too is in tears. 28 years in waiting and the helicopter shot has brought an end to the game.Perfect time for Dhoni to hit the winning runs. He deserves to hit the runs.

INDIA:47.3  Malinga to Dhoni, FOUR!!, Tom Moody has been bitten by the Shaz bug, uses his iconic cliche - that went to the fence like a tracer bullet, a low full toss on middle has been whip flicked past Kula who dived, but only in vain, at fine leg, only a couple of steps to his left, but the pace of the ball was too hard and too tough to contain for the Lankan pacer
INDIA:47.2  Malinga to Dhoni, FOUR!!, Dhoni has timed the pants off that, it was the slower delivery that slipped down leg, Dhoni closes the face of the bat and tickled that past a diving Kula at fine leg, what timing from the Chennai Super King man, the crowd have gone ballistic and rightly so, Kula dived to his left, but could not cut it backThe ICC have announced that Yuvraj has been named the MoS.

After so many days of this WC, we have come down to the last 4 overs. And this final continues to pulsate and move in one direction to the other.

A direct hit and a matter of a frame here and there, Dhoni stretched and might have made it. David Lloyd who is a former ump says 'IN'.

This is what happened: Gambhir came down the track, it was on a back of a length on middle, Gambhir was cramped for room, the thick under edge cannoned into middle. Perera and the Lankans get into an huddle. They badly needed that wicket. End of a wonderful knock. Gambhir b Perera 97(122) [4s-9] Perera to Gambhir, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!

Sehwag is late in getting his bat down to whip that, it was a pacy short of length delivery on middle and leg, caught Sehwag plumb on the pad, Sehwag went for a review in hope, but it turned out to be a false one. Crucial, massive, monstrous strike that for Sri Lanka and Malinga will have his tail up. The crowd can't believe it. Barely have they had time to settle down and before they could realise, the Delhi Daredevil is gone. Top-scorer in the 2003 final - India lost, a duck here - what will the result be? Sehwag lbw b Malinga 0(2) Malinga to Sehwag, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!Sehwag has been given out LBW. He has gone for the review. Like he did against Pakistan the other day, he went for it straightaway, without asking Tendulkar. Aleem Dar gave it out. The Lankans are chuffed. No inside edge onto the pads. Hit low on the pad, Sehwag was on the backfoot and missed the whip to leg. The third ump is having a lot of looks at that. Looks plumb to the naked eye. OUT!

Sehwag is on strike. Malinga will open the attackThe Indian openers have walked out for the chase. As are the Lankans who break out of their huddle. Malinga marks his run-up and is ready to go. All set to go and here we go. Someone from the Indian side has to anchor the innings like Mahela who did so expertly, while the others need to bat around that anchorman. There will be initial swing for both Kula and Malinga. A couple of slips in for Malinga as he runs in to bowl to Sehwag.What late order pyrotechnics from the Lankans and they must be the happier side going into the break. But don't forget that this is supposedly the best batting line-up on the planet, so they would expect and back themselves to chase it down. Even though all the pressure, the drama of a World Cup final chase will weigh on each and everyone of the Indian batsmen's shoulders. This is Srivathsa and I will be taking you through the entire Indian run chase. Don't go too far. I'm joined by Realtime Thiru who will be on scoring.The end: They added crucial runs for the 6th wicket and that helped SL reach 274. 63 runs came off the batting power-play as Zaheer was blasted to all parts. The late momentum shift has placed the Lankans in pole position. Special mention must be made of Mahela's innings - he played the typical nineties ODI innings - using all his vast experience, nudging, patting, tapping and nurdling the ball to all parts of the Wankhede. At the death, too he did not play a single ugly cricketing shot and used his great hands to manouevre the ball. A treat to the eye, it must be said. In a pressure game, a score of 275 would be a tall order even for this talented Indian side to get. Will they? We'll know when we join us for the chase.The start: You know that India are doing well when you see Yuvraj flying all around the park to save runs in the field. What a terrific bowling and fielding performance from the Indians. The Lankans were never allowed to get away and when they did, the Indians came back to take a wicket. Sangakkara looked dangerous, then it was the turn of Mahela, but the Indians kept things tight and never allowed things to drift. The bowling, bar Sreesanth was impeccable and the Lankan batsmen, had to settle for singles and twos. Kulasekara was promoted up the order and he gave Mahela vital assistance.Ricky Ponting in 2003, Adam Gilchrist in 2007 and now Mahela in 2011 - the great players come good on the big occasion. What an innings from the silky touch player and he has put his side in a great position to win the final. An innings full of glorious strokes - not one power hit. Simply stunning.4
SRI LANKA:49.6  Zaheer to Perera, SIX!!, 18 off the last over and what an end to the innings! 63 runs in the batting powerplay, it was full, around the off stump, hoicked away over deep mid wicket, he's a wonderful hitter of the ball, the ball goes all the way!

Virat Kohli and Munaf think so, umpire Dar doesn't. Review time! No deflection seen, looks like this one's heading the batsman's way.

That's what he used to do when he was captaining the side. Like Afridi, Sachin at times, can be exuberant and over-enthusiastic.
SRI LANKA:6.6  Zaheer to Sangakkara, no run, bangs it hard, gets some extra bounce, Sangakkara gets on top of it and drops it down to the on side
SRI LANKA:6.5  Zaheer to Sangakkara, no run, crunched hard! It was a half volley, Sangakkara leant on it and cracked it hard, but Raina at cover fields it pretty well, lovely stuff, the Indian fielding has been really sharp today
SRI LANKA:6.4  Zaheer to Sangakkara, no run, lands on a length outside the off stump, driven on the up to cover
SRI LANKA:6.3  Zaheer to Dilshan, 1 run, a touch short, Dilshan pulls but Dhoni has kept a man at deep square leg, he will only get a single
SRI LANKA:6.2  Zaheer to Sangakkara, 1 run, first runs off the bat in Zaheer's bowling, pitched up and angled in, Sangakkara dabs it to the on side towards mid on, gets off the markKumar Sangakkara, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SRI LANKA:6.1  Zaheer to Tharanga, out Caught by Sehwag!! We all knew this was coming, didn't we? Zakie, you beauty! After bowling three maiden overs, he runs in hard, lands it just a tad short of a good length, gets the ball to move away from Tharanga, he pokes at it tentatively and gets a thick outside edge, the ball flies between Dhoni and Sehwag at first slip, but that's when Sehwag decides to dive to his right and pouch it in his safe pair of hands. End of Tharanga, and that will bring their captain Sangakkara in. Unbelievable stuff from Zaheer this today. Tharanga c Sehwag b Zaheer 2(20) Zaheer to Tharanga, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
SRI LANKA:5.6  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, off the outer half! It moved away ever so slightly as Dilshan looked to go for the cover drive, doesn't go in the air luckily for Dilshan, Yuvraj fields it at backward point
SRI LANKA:5.5  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, around the off stump again, Dilshan swats at it with a high backlift, straight to mid off though
SRI LANKA:5.4  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, lands on a length, off stumpish, doesn't come onto the bat all that quick, pushed to cover after getting on the frontfoot
SRI LANKA:5.3  Sreesanth to Dilshan, FOUR!!, poor ball! Short and Dilshan cuts it through point with venom, the ball reaches the fence at the rate of knots, fabulous shot that from Dilshan
SRI LANKA:5.2  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, beaut! Pitches it up around the off stump or slightly outside, gets it to move away, gets some extra bounce, more pace on it, that one clocked 145.3 kph, beats the outside edge of Dilshan
SRI LANKA:5.1  Sreesanth to Dilshan, FOUR!!, Dilshan breaks the shackles, pulls it over mid wicket off the frontfoot, the bounce aiding that shot of his, the Sri Lankan supporters love it, wasn't all that bad a delivery from Sreesanth though
SRI LANKA:4.6  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, 3 Maiden overs on the trot for Zaheer! Back of a length and on the off and middle, pushed off the backfoot back to the bowler
SRI LANKA:4.5  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, much fuller, Tharanga opens the face and square drives it to point
SRI LANKA:4.4  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, Tharanga goes back and steers one to the left of Yuvraj at point, he's looking as fit as ever, runs quickly and puts his hand out to prevent the ball from running away
SRI LANKA:4.3  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, beaten! Lands in front of a length and gets it to shape away, Tharanga was going for the frontfoot slash to crunch it through cover, makes no contact, meets thin air!
SRI LANKA:4.2  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, length ball, a hint of extra bounce, defended off the frontfoot to the off side
SRI LANKA:4.1  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, pitched up by Zaheer around the off stump, driven on the frontfoot to cover, the ball is not coming onto the bat as easily as we have seen so far at the other venues in India, or is it just good bowling?One has to commend Sreesanth too. He is known to be a volatile character, and can be inconsistent with both his line and length. But today he is up to it. After a gap of 42 days, he has been inducted into the side and he is not letting them down. In a big final and Sree has soaked up all the pressure and not trying to over-do things.
SRI LANKA:3.6  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, a tight delivery to end another good over, in the channel outside the off stump, not too short and not too full, crunched off the backfoot but straight to Kohli
SRI LANKA:3.5  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, there is a man at short cover now, and only one slip in place, fuller from Sreesanth, driven to Kohli who is out there doing a lot of chirping at short cover
SRI LANKA:3.4  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, the pressure is buliding up! These two openers are known to be aggressive and it is indeed tough to keep them silent, but the Indians have managed to do so, short but not much room, slapped to Raina at cover, played off the backfoot
SRI LANKA:3.3  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, back of a length and towards the off stump and thereabouts, punched to Raina at cover
SRI LANKA:3.2  Sreesanth to Tharanga, 1 run, fuller one, Tharanga can't time the drive well, mistimes it down the wicket towards mid off, Sachin misfields, but they don't get any extra run, the ball was just ambling
SRI LANKA:3.1  Sreesanth to Dilshan, 1 run, gets the ball to move away slightly after pitching, Dilshan opens the face of the bat slightly, goes off the thickish outer half to third man, it was played with soft bottom handWhat a difference a World Cup final makes. Back in 2003, Zaheer was smashed all over the park by Gilly and Hayden and from that attack, India never recovered. It's 2011 now and he has started off with two maiden overs. He looks nice and calm, running in with purpose and landing it in the right areas.
SRI LANKA:2.6  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, two maiden overs in a row for Zaheer Khan! Back of a length and around the off stump, appreciable bounce as well, pushed to cover point, fine over!
SRI LANKA:2.5  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, piches outside off again, moves away, Tharanga shoulders arms

SRI LANKA:2.3  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, three good looking shots but Tharanga hasn't been able to pierce the gap on all 3 occasions. Drives the half volley, but Yuvraj at backward point is quick to bend down to his right and stop it, Zaheer is setting it up nicely
SRI LANKA:2.2  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, drags the length back a wee bit, Tharanga cuts, but straight to Yuvraj Singh at point
SRI LANKA:2.1  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, slightly overpitched from Zaheer, Tharanga leans and drives, wonderful diving stop (to his right) by Raina at cover point, the crowds love it!
SRI LANKA:1.6  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, that should have been dispatched, but Dilshan can't. It was short and rising on Dilshan, he did well to get on top of it but the pace was a touch more, ends up chopping it to cover
SRI LANKA:1.5  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, fuller delivery angled in towards the pads of Dilshan, he misses the flick, rapped on the pad, no appeal whatsoever, it was sliding down
SRI LANKA:1.4  Sreesanth to Dilshan, 2 runs, short of a good length with some width on offer, that's Dilshan's strength, Dilshan cracks it off the backfoot wide of Raina at cover point, he does well to move quickly to his left and stretch to get some hand to it, takes the pace off the ball and it will just be two!
SRI LANKA:1.3  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, short of a length and around the off stump, Dilshan gets on top of the bounce and drops it down to the off side towards pointTharanga has broken his bat, he is asking for another one, slight delay.
SRI LANKA:1.2  Sreesanth to Tharanga, 1 run, fuller one, driven hard to mid on, and they take a single, as soon as the ball was bowled, Aleem Dar has a small word with Sreesanth for running on the danger area

SRI LANKA:1.1  Sreesanth to Dilshan, no run, loud appeal from Sreesanth, not given! It was angled in, Dilshan was looking to hoick it across the line, does not get bat on ball, rapped on the front pad but it was clearly going don the leg, looked like Sreesanth would never stop appealing until the finger is raised, but he realises that the umpire is not gonna do soS Sreesanth, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attackChants of Sreesanth Sreesanth doing the rounds, what a game for this man! Getting his big break in this all important final! Let's see how it goes.
SRI LANKA:0.6  Zaheer to Dilshan, leg byes, 1 run, A MAIDEN OVER!! for Zaheer, no runs off the bat, this one was bowled on the pad, he is getting reasonable bounce, Dilshan can't tuck it away, goes off his thigh pad towards square leg
SRI LANKA:0.5  Zaheer to Tharanga, byes, 1 run, first runs on board for Sri Lanka, the ball pitches outside off, moves away a tad as Tharanga lifts his arms, Dhoni can't collect it cleanly, that allows the batsmen to complete a single
SRI LANKA:0.4  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, in the channel outside the fof stump, not much movement again, a slight hint of away movement, Tharanga shoulders arms
SRI LANKA:0.3  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, no movement on this one, a length ball angled in, Tharanga gets behind the line of the delivery and defends it to the on side, there is a lot of buzz in the crowd, Zaheer looks pumped up
SRI LANKA:0.2  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, Peach! Zaheer gets one to swing away from Tharanga, it landed just in front of a length luring Tharanga forward, the ball whistles past the outside edge and beats the bat by a kitten's whisker
SRI LANKA:0.1  Zaheer to Tharanga, no run, that's a good one to start with, slightly back of a length and coming back in towards Tharanga, he's hit high on the pad as he gets forward, the extra bounce doing the trick, no appeal whatsoever from the IndiansTharanga and Dilshan are at the crease. Tharanga is on strike. Zaheer will open the attackWell, two slips in place for Tharanga. Zaheer runs in!The National Anthems of Sri Lanka and India go on air for one last time in this World Cup. It is "Namo Namo Matha" to start with, there are a lot of Sri Lankan supporters among the crowd who are singing the anthem with a lot of pride and enthusiasm. They want their side to come out victorious. A moment of silence before "Jana Gana Mana" begins. The whole stadium reverberates to the melodious anthem. Fans are seen with their palms on their heart. Bollywood star, Aamir Khan is there, along with Nita Ambani, they are the Mumbaikars, and they will be out here to cheer for Team India. The anthems end and it's time for business.A packed stadium at the Wankhede. No Ashwin again, Dhoni reckons that the sub continent batsmen are better against spin bowling. Sreesanth has been chosen ahead of the Chennai spinner. Will he deliver today? Meanwhile, Sri Lanka have made 4 changes. Remember, even in the 2003 World Cup final India chased, but they had won the toss then. This time it's different, the boundaries are shorter and chasing will be a bit easy. They have to tackle the spin of Murali and Randiv nevertheless. This is Ajith, I will be with you until the first drinks break.Asinine writes in: India won their only World Cup so far by batting first. SL won their only World Cup so far by chasing. One will change today.Teams:Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Tillakaratne Dilshan, Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara(w/c), Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Kapugedera, Thissara Perera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Suraj Randiv, Lasith Malinga, Muttiah MuralitharanIndia (Playing XI): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni(w/c), Suresh Raina, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, S SreesanthDhoni: Big games, you would always want to put runs on board, but we need to field well. It is important to be calm and cool. We have Sreesanth in place of Nehra. It is a good game, a pressure game and it will be good to restrict the opposition to as little as possible.Sangakkara: We would like to bat first, their side is good and they are the favorites, for us it is all about doing what we do the best. We are excited, everyone is happy to be here. We have got a few changes, we are going in with 6 batsmen and 5 bowlers. Kapugedera is in, Perera and Kulasekara are in.Sri Lanka have won the toss and elected to batConfusion Confusion, the match referee could not hear what Sanga called. The match referee reckons Sanga has called it wrong, but Sanga thinks otherwise. He says he called it right. Lots of noise in the background, and they couldn't listen to the captain's call. They toss the coin again.Alright, toss time, for one final time here at the 2011 World Cup.MS Dhoni in tournament finals: Played 8, won 4 and lost 4. The Indians have won the 2007 T20 World Cup, the CB series in Australia in 2008, Compaq Cup in 2008 and Asia Cup 2010 under him. They have lost the Kitply Cup that involved Bangladesh and Pakistan, Asia Cup 2008, the tri series in Sri Lanka 2008 and the Bangladesh tri series in 2010.Pitch report: The red soil will assist some turn as the game goes forward. The wicket is evenly rolled, not much grass on the wicket. Some movement early on for the quick bowlers due to the moisture in the wicket, but it is still a win the toss bat first wicket feels Sourav Ganguly.Weather report: Max temp: 33 deg. Humidity 69% It will be hot and humid, no rain whatsoever!Sunny 2010 writes in: M for Mirpur, India beat Bangladash. M for Motera, India beat Australia. M for Mohali, India beat Pakistan. M for Mumbai, will India beat Sri Lanka??1:35 PM IST: Sreesanth or Ashwin? Sreesanth is practicing hard in the nets. Will he get the big break in this big game? Is Dhoni going with his instincts again? Let's not assume much, it is tough to read Dhoni's mind, we will have to wait for the toss, 25 minutes to go.Russel Arnold reckons there may be two to three changes in the Sri Lankan camp. He wants Randiv to come in place of Herath and Kulasekara in place of Mendis. Sunil Gavaskar feels that this new wicket will assist the spinners, but also ensures that it will be a high scoring game.The umpires for today's game are Simon Taufel and Aleem Dar. Ian Gould is the third umpire.Umpire par excellence - Simon Taufel: There are no guarantees as far as umpiring is concerned, it is a very demanding job. I made myself available for the World Cup final and with God's grace, with some help from Ricky Ponting's men, I am here officiating in the final. The India Pakistan game was a pressure encounter, I went through my umpiring coaching manuals, made sure I watch the ball carefully and I'm glad I did well. The guys were responding well, they have handled the pressure well, especially the cricketers from India and Pakistan who come in with a lot of expectations. They deserve a lot of credit. As an umpire, I want to thank all those people who have helped me get here.Injuries, fitness, and player selections: It has been confirmed that Angelo Mathews won't take part in today's final, a big blow indeed. Ashish Nehra, for India, won't feature in the all important game, thanks to his fractured finger. Muralitharan is not fully fit, but he made his intentions clear and he will be raring to go and fight it out today. The red soil in the wicket will assist spinners, so it would be surprising if Ashwin doesn't play.India and Sri Lanka, World Cup history: It was the 25th of June, 1983 when Kapil Dev's India lifted the World Cup at Lord's. 17th March 1996, it was Ranatunga's Sri Lanka who did the same at Lahore. By the end of today, one team would give their fans a chance to relive that moment again. Who will it be? India? Sri Lanka?When the tournament began on the 19th of February, there were 5 teams considered to be among the favorites - India, Sri Lanka, Australia, South Africa and England. England's journey was cut short by the Lankans, South Africa were outdone in a thriller by the Kiwis, and India sent the defending World Champions - Australia - thrashing. To be honest, these two teams have undoubtedly been the best; Sri Lankan top order has done the job for them more often than not while the Little Master has led the Indian batting by being as consistent as ever. On paper, to me, there is nothing much to choose between the two teams. But, who will script the perfect ending? The coundown starts folks.12:20 PM IST: Let us have a look at the Head to Head between these two teams. They have played 134 ODIs, India have won 67 while Sri Lanka have won 50. Talking about World Cups, India have won 2 and Sri Lanka have won 4 in the 7 times that the two teams have clashed.After 42 topsy-turvy league games, 4 breath-taking quarter-finals and 2 nerve-wracking semis, we have got the two finalists who lock horns at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai today. They were the favorites at the start of the tournament and they haven't disappointed anyone. It is the battle of the sub-continent giants, India and Sri Lanka. The dice has been rolled, the prayers have been said, the wishes are made and the predictions are done. But what matters is, how the two teams handle the pressure during these eight hours.This is Ajith, and as always, I will take you through the day along with Sid V and Srivathsa. For one last time in this World Cup, we are here to bring you the best coverage possible. We are as excited as you are. It is a big game, a big day - the final of the 2011 World Cup. Don't go away, plenty of updates are coming your way.by Saurabh SomaniIt's been a tournament of upsets, unpredictable results, topsy-turvy group stages and heady cricket. In spite of that, the pre-tournament favourites meet in the final showdown. It couldn't have been scripted better in Hollywood: co-hosts taking on one another; the world's greatest batsman on one side versus the world's greatest bowler on the other; the most devastating batting line-up against the bowling attack that is the most varied.
Perhaps the most surprising thing is that after what seems eons, there is finally a match between India and Sri Lanka that does not seem meaningless. Meaningless, is in fact, pretty much the furthest adjective that can be used to describe the occasion. No wicket-keeper captain has won the World Cup in nine previous editions, and either way history will be made. There's plenty to read and soak in the atmosphere during the big day:
The Indian team's most remarkable aspect has been the transformation its bowling and fielding have undergone after the knock-out stages have begun. Sachin Tendulkar leads the batting charts for India, while Zaheer Khan has been a colossus with the ball, taking at least one wicket in every match. They both have a strong chance of ending the tournament as highest run-getter and highest-wicket taker each. And then there's the all-round brilliance of Yuvraj Singh and the destructive mayhem of Virender Sehwag.
Sri Lanka have all the tools required to emerge champions. Not that they have no weaknesses, but their game-plan is sound enough for the numerous strengths to cover for the weaknesses. Tillakaratne Dilshan is the tournament's leading run-scorer, while Sangakkara is averaging over 100 runs. The old warhorse Muttiah Muralitharan has 15 wickets, some distance clear of Sri Lanka's X-factor Lasith Malinga who is next with 11. Can the top order put enough runs so that the middle order is not exposed, is the question every Sri Lankan fan has. The bowling though, is of the kind to reassure anyone. The most varied, and perhaps the most potent.
The battle between Sachin Tendulkar and Muttiah Muralitharan is one for the ages. This will be the last time the two old masters cross swords. This will also be the last time either of them play in a World Cup match. One of them will have a fairy-tale ending, the other will be denied at the doorstep of victory. There are similarities that bind them, there are milestones that beckon, but there will be only one winner in their final clash.
The Numbers always make the most compelling of cases. You can summarize history with them. Who has won more tournament finals against each other between India and Sri Lanka? Which batsmen have seized the day and taken their teams to victory? Which bowlers have raised their games and been the biggest threats?
There is nothing like good old-fashioned nostalgia on the eve of the biggest cricketing night. Ten months ago, on the eve of another World Cup final, Saurabh Somani visited the home of cricket - Lord's. The scene of India's first World Cup triumph.
