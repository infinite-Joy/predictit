Muzarabani will open the attackThe players are making their way out to the middle. Porterfield and Sterling will be the openers for Ireland. Muzarabani to open the attack. Here we go...It was then the Raza and Chigumbura partnership that bailed Zimbabwe out of trouble. The pair added 71 runs for the 5th wicket and were well set to take on the bowling. But the skipper got out and Raza fell soon after his fifty. The lower-order failed to bat out the 50 overs. Having already lost the series, Ireland would fancy their chances with this one and go home with a consolation win. Join us back in a few minutes for their reply.Ireland have done extremely well to restrict the home side to a below par total. Porterfield elected to bowl and his bowlers haven't let him down. Young and Murtagh struck early to send back the openers. Chari and Williams resurrected the innings with the latter scoring a fifty. However, the partnership was not threatening and both departed in quick succession. 4
ZIMBABWE:49.2 K O'Brien to Muzarabani, out Lbw!! That's it! Zimbabwe have been bowled out under 200. Ireland will be extremely happy with this effort. This was a you miss, I hit sort of thing.

Looked very close, the impact may have just been outside the line of off and that's what saved the batsman there
ZIMBABWE:46.2 C Young to Muzarabani, 1 run, poor cricket from Ireland on this ball. They shouldn't allow easy singles like this.

Even though three Irish batters recorded fifty-plus scores in the last game, they couldn't get over the line. Their bowling has been a little disappointing, considering that their spinners haven't been able to make the most of these slow and low pitches. They'll be looking to change all that when they take the field today. Stay tuned for the toss and the teams.If it was Sikandar Raza's heroics that won the first game for the hosts, it was Craig Ervine's unbeaten century that saw them take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, their first ODI series win in the last two years. Zimbabwe will now be looking to make it three out of three today and on the other hand, Ireland will be playing for pride. Remember, the Irish defeated Zimbabwe in the ODI World Cup earlier this year. So, Zimbabwe can't afford to take them lightly today.Before the start of the series, everyone expected a close contest between both these sides. In fact, that is what exactly happened. Even though the series score stands at 2-0 in favour of the Zimbabweans, both the matches went right down to the wire. Hello and a warm welcome to the third and final ODI between Zimbabwe and Ireland.Teams:Ireland (From): William Porterfield(c), Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce, Niall O'Brien, Andrew Balbirnie, Gary Wilson(w), Kevin O'Brien, John Mooney, George Dockrell, Andy McBrine, Tim Murtagh, Stuart Poynter, Max Sorensen, Stuart Thompson, Craig YoungZimbabwe (From): Chamu Chibhabha, Richmond Mutumbami(w), Craig Ervine, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura(c), Sikandar Raza, Taurai Muzarabani, Graeme Cremer, Wellington Masakadza, Luke Jongwe, Tinashe Panyangara, John Nyumbu, Brian Chari, Malcolm Waller, Prosper Utseya, Chris Mpofu, Neville MadzivaLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
