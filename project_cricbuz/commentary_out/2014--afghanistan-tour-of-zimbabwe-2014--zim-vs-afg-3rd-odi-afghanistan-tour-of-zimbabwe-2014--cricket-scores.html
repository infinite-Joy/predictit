After losing the first wicket early, Hamilton Masakadza and Brendan Taylor shared a 109-run stand with both the batsmen getting to their respective fifties. Later Sean Williams fell just one run short of what could have been a well-compiled half-century. The lower middle order was not able to contribute too many runs but the guys at the top had already done their job. Can Afghanistan chase this down? Join us in a while to know the answers...4
