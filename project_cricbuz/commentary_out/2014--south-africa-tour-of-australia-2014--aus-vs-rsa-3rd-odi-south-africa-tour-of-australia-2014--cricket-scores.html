Or will Australia take a 2-1 lead in the series? Join us back in a short while to find out...It has been an excellent batting display by the Australians. They paced their innings to perfection. First, Warner and Finch got them off to a flier as they added 118 runs for the first wicket. The former fell soon after reaching his fifty, while Watson came in and carried the momentum with a quickfire 40. Finch kept going at one end and brought up his 5th ODI hundred.

On the other hand, Pat Cummins and Xavier Doherty have been roped in.Hello and welcome to the 3rd ODI between Australia and South Africa that is being played at the Manuka Oval, Canberra. Both teams would like a win today as it would give them a significant advantage going into the final two ODIs. So, who will come out on top? We will get our answer only at the end of the day. For now, stay tuned for the toss and teams.Australia and South Africa, both teams will go into the third ODI with problems of their own. In the first game, Australia looked very good as apart from AB de Villiers and David Miller, no other South African could put up a fight. South Africa came back well in the second ODI. Their bowlers did extremely well to bowl Australia out for a meagre total. However, their batsmen disappointed yet again, and it was only de Villiers and Miller, who managed to take South Africa past the finishing line.Preview by Gokul GopalWith the series tied at 1-1, both Australia and South Africa will be eager to take the lead when they face off in the third ODI of the 5-match series, in Canberra. The hosts won the opening ODI in a comfortable fashion before coming up with a dismal batting show in the next game, which enabled the Proteas level the series. Australia will be eager to get back to winnings ways while the tourists, who did struggle a bit in a small chase in the previous game, will be aiming for a more clinical performance.Australia:The Australian top order has not quite fired in this series and the injury to Michael Clarke during the first match was a further blow to the batting order. The top-order has not delivered so far - Warner and Finch made promising starts in the first game, but failed to convert it, while they fell for cheap scores in the following match. Apart from Bailey's half-century in the first match and Mitchell Marsh's fifty in the next, there's hardly been any praiseworthy performance as far as the home-team's batting is concerned. Also, the fact that they were bowled out for just 154 in the 2nd ODI means that there's an added pressure on the batsmen to make up for the failure.Nathan Coulter-Nile did a fine job by picking up 4/48 in the first ODI to bowl out South Africa before they could reach the target in the first game. In the next, Josh Hazlewood, with a career-best 5/31, gave the Proteas quite a scare, but his efforts proved futile in the end. However, these performances will be a big boost to the Australian side, who will be without Mitchell Johnson for the remainder of the series as the left-arm pacer has been rested. While Marsh did not bowl more than an over in the second ODI, he is expected to play a bigger role with the ball in the next game. Australia also have the option of bringing in all-rounder James Faulkner. Overall, the bowling has been on the mark and the hosts will be hoping that they continue in the same vein.South Africa:AB de Villiers and David Miller did most of the scoring for South Africa in both the matches so far. They stitched together a fine partnership to help the visitors recover from a top-order collapse in the opening game. However, their efforts eventually went in vain. In the second game, they were again involved in a good stand after the top-order failed to contribute yet again. While these two have done a good job, the same cannot be said of the rest of the batters. The likes of Quinton de Kock, Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis need to come up with a better effort at the top of the order and skipper de Villiers will be hoping that it happens in the next game.Vernon Philander impressed in the first match with a four-wicket haul, but South Africa could not sustain the pressure, which meant that Australia posted a total of 300 in the first game. Dale Steyn and Ryan McLaren went for a few in that game while Morne Morkel was also slightly expensive. However, Morkel made up for that by picking up a career-best 5/31 in the 2nd match to bowl out the Australians for a paltry total. Steyn too got amongst the wickets during their series-levelling win while Philander was on the mark as well. A similar performance is what the South Africans will be hoping for as they head to Canberra, where the pitch is likely to assist the batters.Team News:Australia made a few changes to the squad, bringing in Pat Cummins and Xavier Doherty in place of Mitchell Johnson and Nathan Lyon. With Mitchell Starc also in the 15-member team, the hosts have quite a few pace options. Meanwhile, South Africa are unlikely to make any changes to their eleven.Numbers:87: The number of runs George Bailey needs to get to 2000 in One Day Internationals.155: The number of runs Faf du Plessis requires to reach the mark of 2000 in ODIs.Quotes:I don't expect anything less in this series. It would be a disappointment if Mitch Johnson didn't abuse Faf (du Plessis). It would be disappointing if I didn't abuse somebody, and (David) Warner didn't have a go at someone. Why would anyone want to come and watch us play cricket apart from our skills? It's got to be entertaining and that's why we play: Dale Steyn expects further skirmishes between the two teams before the series ends.Teams:South Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, Farhaan Behardien, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), David Miller, Vernon Philander, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Imran Tahir, Kyle Abbott, Wayne Parnell, Ryan McLaren, Robin PetersonAustralia (From): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson, Steven Smith, George Bailey(c), Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), Glenn Maxwell, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Xavier Doherty, Josh Hazlewood, James Faulkner, Mitchell Starc, Kane Richardson, Pat CumminsLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
