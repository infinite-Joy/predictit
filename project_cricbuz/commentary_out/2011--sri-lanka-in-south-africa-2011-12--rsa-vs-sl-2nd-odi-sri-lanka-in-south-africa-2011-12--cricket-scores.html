The surface looks good for batting, but the overhead cloud conditions will help the bowlers get some swing with the new ball. There is a dark tinge on the pitch which means that there should be some moisture on the surface. It will become a belter as the match wears on.South Africa have won the toss and elected to fieldDilshan: We would have batted on this surface. The morale is pretty good in the squad. We have 2 injury enforced changes. Dilhara is out with an injury and so is Ajantha Mendis. They will be replaced by Dhammika and Rangana Herath. We are up for the challenge.ABDV: We will bowl first. There is a bit of cloud cover and I am confident about our batting line up. We will start from the beginning and have no changes in our squad. We are looking forward to a good contest.Better news from the middle, the rain has stopped and the covers are being removed from the squareMore covers are coming across to cover the entire square. The start will definitely be delayed..The pitch has been covered by the ground-staff. Mike Haysman thinks that the weather reports suggest for rain later on in the day. The temperatures are dipping and the lights have already been switched on.A slight drizzle has started just as the toss was to take place. The toss has been delayed.Sri Lanka were blown away at Paarl, recording their lowest ever score in ODI cricket. Dilshan termed it as the worst day of his career. AB de Villiers could not have hoped for a better introduction as the captain of the ODI team. The scene now moves over to East London for the 2nd match of the rubber. Sri Lanka have shown that they are a team to reckon in the shorter form of the game while South Africa will look to go 2-0 ahead. Hello and a warm welcome to the 2nd ODI between South Africa and Sri Lanka from the warm environs of the Buffalo Park.Preview by Anoop Naval South Africa are armed with the confidence of a mammoth 258 run victory after the Sri Lankan batting order collapsed in a heap for just 43. Thanks to the works of Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe with the ball, and Kallis, Amla and de Villiers with the bat, the Proteas march into the second ODI beaming with confidence and looking to deepen the dent on the already demoralized Lankan side. South Africa: Like their Test team, the Proteas have just the perfect blend of talent and experience in the ODI side. Though former skipper Graeme Smith needs to find some wood on his bat, it is to be noted that Smith and JP Duminy were the only batsmen who failed in the last ODI. It was certainly reflected in his burgeoning century that put RSA in the driver's seat, that Hashim Amla is a class batsman. He is now averaging 56.38 after 53 appearances in the 50-overs game and has a fine strike rate of just under 92 into the bargain. Veteran Jacques Kallis is perfectly capable of singlehandedly taking South Africa ashore if need be. Debutant skipper Abraham Benjamin de Villiers only adds to the Lankan woes with his consistent form with the bat. Albie Morkel and du Plessis did fire from the bat though both the batsmen had really short stints at the crease. As far as the bowling is concerned South Africa have nothing to worry about. Morkel's career best figures of 4/10, supported by Tsotsobe's 3/19 literally obliterated Sri Lanka, and Dale Steyn's ability to swing the ball at speeds clocking above 140 consistently to boot, will not only spell disaster to a jittery side like Lanka, but will also ensure as less runs on the board as possible(Keep in mind that apart from losing wickets, Lanka managed to play 20.1 overs and still scored only 43) Sri Lanka: What Sri Lanka need with great urgency is for their batsmen to find some form or for the team to find some batsmen who can contribute. Though their bowlers were able to keep the overflow of runs from the Protean onslaught in check, the Lankan batsmen were back in the dressing room before they could say "bat". It is disappointing for a World Cup finalist team to have won just 6 of the 18 ODIs they have played after the World Cup final. It is also really hard to acknowledge the presence of greats like Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardhane who have more than 300 ODIs' experience to their credit. Moreover, underneath the shabby batting lies a weakened and inefficient bowling attack. Although Lasith Malinga and Ajantha Mendis together managed to hold the Protean batters in check, it does not take a rocket scientist to infer that the Lankan bowling has guillotined after Murali's retirement. Even crumbs of comfort for the visitors are hard to find after the 258 run hiding. All one can come up with at this time is that they were hammered in the opening match of the test series but bounced back to win the second test. Lanka will be hoping for a similiar comeback in the second ODI. Venue: Buffalo Park, New London - International cricket returns to Buffalo Park after a gap of more than 5 years - the last completed match being a six wicket win by South Africa over Zimbabwe in September 2006. In the total 17 ODIs played at this venue so far involving South Africa, two were abandoned due to bad weather, the Proteas won 11 and lost the other 4. Since 2000, the Proteas have been a formidable force in East London with seven wins and the other two matches were abandoned meaning the last time the hosts tasted defeat at this ground came way back in 1999 when the West Indies emerged victorious. The only head to head with Sri Lanka at this venue came in December 2000 which South Africa won by 95 runs. Final Word: A lethal Protean side, a struggling Sri Lanka team. The South African side could as well be going fishing in East London, lest the lions can pull back and stun the all confident hosts with a win.
