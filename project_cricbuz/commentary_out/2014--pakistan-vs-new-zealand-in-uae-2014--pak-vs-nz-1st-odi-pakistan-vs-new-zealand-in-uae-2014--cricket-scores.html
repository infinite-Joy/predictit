An interesting chase is the cards. Will dew play a crucial role in the second innings? Join us back in a short while to find out more.Ross Taylor gets a great round of applause from the crowd as he leaves the field. But for him, New Zealand wouldn't have got a sizeable total on the board. The visitors were jolted early by Mohammad Irfan and Wahab Riaz as they reduced New Zealand to 66/3. Tom Latham and Luke Ronchi promised for a while, but both threw their wickets away. The Black Caps got a bit of momentum with a fifty partnership between Taylor and Daniel Vettori.

Irfan was the pick of the bowlers picking up three wickets, while the rest of bowlers gave good support.4

Guptill is still strugging with the hamstring. Corey is not playing this game just a precaution."Misbah: "We have see a lot of dew in coming every night, so we don't want to take chances. It is difficult to bowl with the dew. He is such an important member of our bowling, but the others have to take responsibility. Umar is playing."Pakistan have won the toss and have opted to fieldPitch Report: "The pitch looks amazing, the scars are completely gone and it looks like a brand new cricket pitch. Remember, two T20s were played on this very surface. If you win the toss you want to bat, but the big question is the dew. I would want to bowl here though," reckons Scott Styris.The pitch for today's game is the same as the one used for both T20Is. So it is expected to aid the spinners as the game progresses. It will be interesting to see the team combinations of both the sides. Toss and more coming up in a very short while.Both teams shared honours in the T20I series. The action now shifts to the 5-match ODI series, with the first match being played at Dubai. The news from the New Zealand camp is that Martin Guptill has been ruled out of today's match due to a hamstring injury. Meanwhile, we could see the return of Umar Gul to the ODI setup for the first time since March 2014. The last time these two sides met in an ODI was in the 2011 World Cup, when Ross Taylor smashed a wonderful hundred.Teams:New Zealand (From): Martin Guptill, Anton Devcich, Kane Williamson(c), Ross Taylor, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi(w), James Neesham, Daniel Vettori, Kyle Mills, Adam Milne, Mitchell McClenaghan, Nathan McCullum, Tom Latham, Dean Brownlie, Matt HenryPakistan (From): Ahmed Shehzad, Mohammad Hafeez, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq(c), Umar Akmal, Sarfraz Ahmed(w), Shahid Afridi, Wahab Riaz, Umar Gul, Zulfiqar Babar, Mohammad Irfan, Bilawal Bhatti, Haris Sohail, Asad Shafiq, Sohail Tanvir, Nasir JamshedLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
