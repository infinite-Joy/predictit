Nabi will open the attackDonald Tiripano, registering his maiden 5-fer on the international scene, was the pick of the Zimbabwe bowlers, although he leaked some runs. The likes of Shingi Masakadza, Williams chipped in as well. Over to the Zimbabwe batsmen for the run-chase now. Will they gun down the target? Or will the Afghanistan bowlers fire in unison to tie the series? Do join us back for part two of the match.Afghanistan were on track towards a 280-plus total when Nabi and Shafiqullah were on the prowl, wading into the Zimbabwe attack. The hosts though pegged Afghanistan back with four wickets in the last 5 overs. Early on, Naib, Jamal and Shenwari, all got to bright starts, but threw their wickets away.4
