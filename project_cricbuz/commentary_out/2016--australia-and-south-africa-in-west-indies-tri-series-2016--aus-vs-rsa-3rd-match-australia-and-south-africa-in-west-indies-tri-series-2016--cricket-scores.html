AUSTRALIA:34.2 34.2Phangiso to Lyon, out Lbw!! You live by the sword and die by the sword! The sweep shot - the one that fetched more than half the Australian runs today - also brings the closure to their innings. South Africa open their account in the tri-series (that too with a bonus point) with a pleasing win over the mighty Aussies. Coming to the final nail in the coffin: Flatter, quicker and skidded through around off, Lyon instinctively looks to broom it square with a sweep shot, with a half-bent knee. Misses and is knocked in front, a rather easy call for umpire Richard Illingworth. Game over! Lyon lbw b Phangiso 30(31) [4s-4]Phangiso to Lyon, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
AUSTRALIA:34.1 Phangiso to Lyon, FOUR, oh whattay shot Nathan Lyon! He's been playing that sweep shot like a dream. Just the sound when bat made contact with the ball - Crrrrrunched. Drops to one knee and slog-sweeps the fuller delivery over mid-wicket, a couple of bounces and into the fenceAaron Phangiso [5.0-0-22-1] is back into the attackPhangiso to try and finish things off...

AUSTRALIA:32.6 Tahir to Hazlewood, FOUR, Hazlewood becomes the 3rd Australian to compile a double digit score in this game! Times the drive crisply and it scorches off the turf in a hurry. Sweetly timed!Update: Rossouw has been taken to hospital with a suspected dislocated shoulder! Sad news...
AUSTRALIA:32.5 Tahir to Hazlewood, 2 runs, Hazlewood goes past his highest score in ODIs, with his favourite stroke. A lofty drive over extra cover and had it not been for Behardien's dive from wide long-off, it would have been a boundary
AUSTRALIA:32.4 Tahir to Hazlewood, no run, slower through the air and keeps low, Hazlewood just about brings his bat down in time to block that
AUSTRALIA:32.3 Tahir to Hazlewood, no run, pushed through quicker outside off, Hazlewood keeps it out
AUSTRALIA:32.2 Tahir to Lyon, 1 run, flatter on middle, lifted on the bounce towards long-on
AUSTRALIA:32.1 Tahir to Lyon, FOUR, Lyon continues to find runs. Delicacy! Sits on his back knee and takes full toll of the away turn on offer. Opens the bat face and silks a dab through the third man region, Parnell gives chase and slides the ball back but in vainImran Tahir [7.0-0-28-2] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:31.6 Tabraiz Shamsi to Hazlewood, FOUR, shot! Sees the flight and lifts the drive over extra cover, risky shot but the execution was top class

AUSTRALIA:31.4 Tabraiz Shamsi to Hazlewood, no run, short and width on offer, Hazlewood frees his arms and smashes the pull off the toe end, short mid-wicket dives full length to his right and denies him a boundary
AUSTRALIA:31.3 Tabraiz Shamsi to Hazlewood, no run, slowish on middle, bunted to the leg-side19:54 Local Time, 23:54 GMT, 05:24 IST: Oh hello! Chop that, the players are out and we are ready to resume...19:50 Local Time, 23:50 GMT, 05:20 IST: Good news fellas! The rain has eased off but the groundsmen seem to be a bit sceptical. Covers still firmly in place...Just in case you aren't aware: Josh Reginald Hazlewood is yet to be dismissed in ODIs19:35 Local Time, 23:35 GMT, 05:05 IST: Oh this rain, can it leave South Africa alone already? Apparently, it's got heavy enough for the umpires to whisk the players off and call for the covers. Never mind, the Proteas are well ahead anyway on DLS. The result is in no doubt. With the pictures coming in now, it looks a proper shower. I'm waiting for a word on the cut-off time. Will inform you'll as soon as I know....
AUSTRALIA:31.2 Tabraiz Shamsi to Hazlewood, no run, nudged into the on-side
AUSTRALIA:31.1 Tabraiz Shamsi to Lyon, 1 run, punches this down with the turn to long-on
AUSTRALIA:30.6 Phangiso to Lyon, 1 run, sweeping sweeping sweeping, through square leg
AUSTRALIA:30.5 Phangiso to Lyon, no run, now how's that missed off-stump after beating Lyon on his leg-side? Absolutely bizzare. Lyon has walked so far across looking to sweep that despite getting outside the line of it and missing it, the ball has missed off-stump by a clear distanceAnd the rain is starting to pick up. But the fact that there is just one wicket left is swaying the umpires to stick around for that little while longer..
AUSTRALIA:30.4 Phangiso to Hazlewood, 1 run, on the pads from round the wicket, flicked behind squareJosh Hazlewood, left handed bat, comes to the creaseSlip and leg-slip in place...
AUSTRALIA:30.3 Phangiso to Finch, out Caught by de Villiers!! That should be the end of Australia's threat. AB, the superman AB, has flown across to his right from extra-cover and held onto an absolute screamer. Slider slanting in from round the wicket, Finch drives it expansively with an extension of the arms. He might have been wanting to go over the top, but couldn't get under the ball and is supremely caught inside the ring. Finch c de Villiers b Phangiso 72(103) [4s-6 6s-3]Phangiso to Finch, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:30.2 Phangiso to Finch, no run, punched back to the bowler

AUSTRALIA:29.3 Tabraiz Shamsi to Lyon, FOUR, oh these sweeps! If there would have been a region-wise run graphic of Australia's innings, the leg-side would have been an art form. Swept away to the fine leg fence
AUSTRALIA:29.2 Tabraiz Shamsi to Lyon, no run, huge huge appeal. Everyone goes up in unison. But umpire Joel Wilson is unmoved. He's had a tough time out there, the umpire - and Hawkeye shows that he's made another blunder. This is absolutely dead. Drifted on off, turns back in and hits the pad in front of middle and off. Would have killed middle of middle.
AUSTRALIA:29.1 Tabraiz Shamsi to Lyon, 2 runs, the shout is "bowler, bowler" but the throw is at the keeper's end where Lyon makes it with a desperate dive. He tapped it through the backward point region, it was followed by a hesitation which caused some delay and had the throw been at the right end, it might have been fatal
AUSTRALIA:28.6 Phangiso to Finch, no run, fullish, width on offer to free the arms, drilled to cover
AUSTRALIA:28.5 Phangiso to Finch, no run, opened up again. Not as badly as previously in the over though. Thick edge into the off-side
AUSTRALIA:28.4 Phangiso to Finch, no run, slightly short, but Finch can't make good. Chops it to cover
AUSTRALIA:28.3 Phangiso to Finch, no run, arm-ball, fizzes in to cramp Finch for room, he does well to block off the back foot
AUSTRALIA:28.2 Phangiso to Finch, no run, oh my! A man on 71 is completely squared up by a rippah! Follows him down leg with a back of a length dart and it turns against the angle to take a thick outside edge towards backward point
AUSTRALIA:28.1 Phangiso to Lyon, 1 run, that looks dead .. or maybe not! Some glove maybe. Lyon is trying to sweep a full ball from middle and off stump and is very very lucky to get gloveAaron Phangiso [3.0-0-19-0] is back into the attackFinch has absolutely scraped his area of the crease bone dry with the amount of sweeping done. There won't be a strand of grass in that barren land for a million years

AUSTRALIA:27.5 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, mistimes the sweep to short fine leg
AUSTRALIA:27.4 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, the ball is drifting on with the arm outside off, Finch is intent on the sweep but the length is a little too full and it sneaks under him
AUSTRALIA:27.3 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, googly, Shamsi's pace has been quicker than a usual spinner, punched to mid-off
AUSTRALIA:27.2 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, too much premeditation. You know what's coming every ball. Shamsi fires it very full to foil the sweep and hit the pad but couldn't bowl it in line of the stumps. Hit outside off
AUSTRALIA:27.1 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, sticks his bat in front of the body, takes it on the full and paddles the sweep to short fine leg
AUSTRALIA:26.6 Parnell to Lyon, no run, length ball aiming for off, Lyon gets half-forward and defends

AUSTRALIA:26.4 Parnell to Lyon, 1 run, nudged off the hips down to fine leg
AUSTRALIA:26.3 Parnell to Lyon, no run, cuts him in half with the angle! Nips back in a touch, the angle helps it further, and Lyon has already left a big gap between bat and pad as he is flirting away from the body. Splits the gap between the off stump and the inside edge
AUSTRALIA:26.2 Parnell to Lyon, no run, stays flat-footed to a similar delivery and presents the straight bat
AUSTRALIA:26.1 Parnell to Lyon, no run, back of a length delivery from round the wicket, angles it in towards the stumps, obdurately blockedWayne Parnell [5.0-1-21-2] is back into the attackFinch is the only one standing between South Africa and victory. Mirrors the pattern of South Africa's innings where Behardien stood firm, only that the intensity of this crisis is herculean.
AUSTRALIA:25.6 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, brisk, fullish around middle and leg, Finch exposes his leg-stump while looking to sweep, deflects it off some glove to short fine leg

AUSTRALIA:25.2 Tabraiz Shamsi to Lyon, 1 run, worked off the pads behind square

AUSTRALIA:24.6 Tahir to Finch, no run, loud groan from Finch! It's been darted short and wide, and Finch is beaten for pace on the attempted cut
AUSTRALIA:24.5 Tahir to Finch, no run, tries a sweep one more time, the ball deflects off the thigh pad and rolls to de Kock
AUSTRALIA:24.4 Tahir to Finch, no run, chops the attempted cut into the covers
AUSTRALIA:24.3 Tahir to Lyon, 1 run, swept off a thick top-edge through the square leg region
AUSTRALIA:24.2 Tahir to Finch, 3 runs, beautifully laces the late-cut behind backward point, it's a spectacular effort from Rossouw to hunt it down from backward point and flick it back in with a slide. But wait a minute, he's down on the floor clutching his right shoulder and writhing in pain. This looks real bad for Rossouw. He is now being helped off the field
AUSTRALIA:24.1 Tahir to Finch, no run, tries to fetch the sweep from outside off .. but again .. the low bounce. It's made life very difficult
AUSTRALIA:23.6 Rabada to Lyon, no run, opens the bat-face and angles it to backward point

AUSTRALIA:23.3 Rabada to Finch, no run, tilts this length ball in on middle from wide on the crease, tucked to short mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:23.2 Rabada to Finch, no run, length ball outside off, driven off the toe-end to cover
AUSTRALIA:23.1 Rabada to Finch, no run, thigh pad perhaps, or was there glove too? Wouldn't matter now as de Kock has failed to hold on. Short of length down leg, but it's not all that short to be pulling - not on this pitch at least. Finch is handcuffed on the stroke and misses. Deflects off the body to the left of the keeper who is going one-handed and fails to hold on
AUSTRALIA:22.6 Tahir to Lyon, no run, another appeal. Too much excitement. This is a leg-break which pitches off and turns to miss Lyon's sweep and hit the back pad. Missing offNathan Lyon, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:22.5 Tahir to Zampa, out Lbw!! Australia are being routed. Suddenly, the target is looking very far indeed. Tahir slips in a googly, lands it on the perfect length which is outside the defensive reach of Zampa. It snakes in, hits pad first and the impact is in line with off. Gone sir! Zampa lbw b Tahir 0(1)Tahir to Zampa, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
AUSTRALIA:22.4 Tahir to Finch, 1 run, swept away to deep mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:22.3 Tahir to Finch, FOUR, he is absolutely exhausting the sweep. Another one, this is hit fine and races away

AUSTRALIA:22.1 Tahir to Finch, no run, googly, snakes in and strikes the pad - hit outside offAdam Zampa, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:21.6 Rabada to Coulter-Nile, out Bowled!! Oh what a rip-roaring yorker. It's at pace and NCN has no answers. Actually, it's very cunning on the Aussie pacer. He got some bat on the ball while trying to dig it out, but the contact isn't enough to obstruct it's path completely, the ball bounces and shaves the leg bail. Coulter-Nile b Rabada 0(7)Rabada to Coulter-Nile, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
AUSTRALIA:21.5 Rabada to Coulter-Nile, no run, it looked like a cutter on first glance, but the speed gun suggests otherwise - 136ks. What happened was that when the ball landed, the pitch suckered out all its gas causing it to stop on NCN who checked his push to cover
AUSTRALIA:21.4 Rabada to Coulter-Nile, no run, fires in the yorker on off which is safely dug out
AUSTRALIA:21.3 Rabada to Coulter-Nile, no run, length ball slanting in towards off, NCN uses his reach to smother it down
AUSTRALIA:21.2 Rabada to Finch, 1 run, a similar delivery, Finch waits on it THAT extra little moment to dab it down to third man
AUSTRALIA:21.1 Rabada to Finch, no run, hits that back of a length again outside off, Finch safely guides it to backward point
AUSTRALIA:20.6 Tahir to Coulter-Nile, no run, big turn with the googly which snakes in, beats NCN's inside edge and hits him low on the pad. Doing too much
AUSTRALIA:20.5 Tahir to Finch, 1 run, full toss driven to long-on
AUSTRALIA:20.4 Tahir to Finch, no run, the golden rule against spin, when you don't have a clue - sweep. Finch has done plenty of it already. Tries another, misses and is hit on the pad outside off
AUSTRALIA:20.3 Tahir to Finch, no run, another flatter and slightly short leg-break outside off, Finch thinks about cutting it late but bails
AUSTRALIA:20.2 Tahir to Finch, no run, even Finch is being given a tough time. Flipper, zips through outside off and Finch is late on the cut
AUSTRALIA:20.1 Tahir to Finch, no run, Finch is premeditating a sweep to a yorker which hits him flush on the toes, but he had done well to get his foot outside off
AUSTRALIA:19.6 Rabada to Coulter-Nile, no run, Rabada is just skidding the ball through with a lot of fizz. NCN has no clue about the pace of the wicket, he is completely opened up and is thudded on the pad. Going down leg with the angle
AUSTRALIA:19.5 Rabada to Coulter-Nile, no run, pacy full ball, and it's snuck under NCN's defence. It scooted low and NCN never got his bat down to the required heightNathan Coulter-Nile, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:19.4 Rabada to Wade, out Caught by de Kock!! This is exactly what has put South Africa firmly in the ascendancy - timely wickets. Rabada is brought back and he strikes immediately. On a good length from round the wicket, it's in that tempting line outside off where Wade can't resist going for a drive. The only problem is that the length isn't full enough. If anything, it's actually behind a good length. He is never going to be in control of the bounce which Rabada generates due to his height. Nicks it behind where de Kock is smiling even before the ball enters his gloves. Wade c de Kock b Rabada 2(11)Rabada to Wade, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:19.3 Rabada to Wade, no run, skiddy back of a length delivery outside off, patted to backward pointWe are being fed replays of a very early instance in Finch's innings, in which it was assumed that he had gloved Shamsi to short fine. Well, he hadn't and the only point of contact was with his thigh. And with that being the case, he should have been plumb. That, of course, is water under the bridge.
AUSTRALIA:19.2 Rabada to Finch, 1 run, stomps forward and softly dinks it wide of short mid-wicket for a single
AUSTRALIA:19.1 Rabada to Finch, no run, back of a length delivery around off, Finch blocks it back after a mini-hopKagiso Rabada [3.0-1-7-1] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:18.6 Tahir to Finch, 1 run, turns back in to take a thick inside edge before wandering behind square
AUSTRALIA:18.5 Tahir to Wade, 1 run, googly on middle and leg, neatly swept to deep backward square
AUSTRALIA:18.4 Tahir to Wade, no run, Wade is all at sea. All at sea. No clue. It's been a miserable 8-ball stay so far. A flighted googly, Wade aims a cover-drive but the ball grips and leaves him wanting
AUSTRALIA:18.3 Tahir to Finch, 1 run, again tries getting outside the line of the ball and brooms it to deep backward square
AUSTRALIA:18.2 Tahir to Finch, no run, quick leg-break just outside off, blocked to cover
AUSTRALIA:18.1 Tahir to Finch, FOUR, swept away fine, skims away into the ropes. It's been Finch's go-to shot tonight and he's absolutely skinned this
AUSTRALIA:17.6 Tabraiz Shamsi to Wade, no run, chipped in the air, on the half-volley to cover who is diving forward
AUSTRALIA:17.5 Tabraiz Shamsi to Wade, no run, now he's beaten him on the outside. The conventional chinaman delivery, rips away after pitching and squares Wade up completely. The pace at which he is bowling is restricting Wade's forward movements which is making him get stuck
AUSTRALIA:17.4 Tabraiz Shamsi to Wade, no run, loud shout from the close in fielders along with Shamsi. Another fizzy googly, sneaks through Wade's defence as he is lunging across and hits the pad. The only question is impact which appears marginal on off
AUSTRALIA:17.3 Tabraiz Shamsi to Wade, no run, googly, it's not picked by Wade and it hits him on the pad. But the ball is going down
AUSTRALIA:17.2 Tabraiz Shamsi to Wade, no run, good awareness from de Kock. Observes Wade adopting the paddle-sweep so he moves to the right slightly and somehow gets in the line of the ball to stop it
AUSTRALIA:17.1 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, 1 run, Finch is constantly going to the sweep against Shamsi. And it's been a risky affair. There's a semblance of a top-edge on this one and it loops up for a while. Wide of short fine though
AUSTRALIA:16.6 Tahir to Wade, no run, still flat on the stumps, blocked
AUSTRALIA:16.5 Tahir to Finch, 1 run, fifty for Finch. He has been counter-attacking from the start and it's worked well. It's a quick leg-break outside off, Finch is initially shaping to scoop it behind but realizes that it's too wide of off. So he adapts and paddle-hacks it behind square
AUSTRALIA:16.4 Tahir to Wade, 1 run, drifts this outside off, Wade plonks his front leg across while going down on one knee, paddles it behind squareMatthew Wade, left handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:16.3 Tahir to Mitchell Marsh, out Caught by de Kock!! Another one. Tahir is pumped. South Africa are pumped. And you can argue that they are in the box seat now with half of Australia's batting back in the hutch. It's a flat leg-break which is turning away outside off, Marsh is lulled by the width but there is no conviction in his attempted cut. His bat is simply drawn out away from the body, and he is in no control of the bounce either being on the front foot. Nicks it behind. The umpires make use of this interval to call drinks. Mitchell Marsh c de Kock b Tahir 8(13) [4s-1]Tahir to Mitchell Marsh, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
AUSTRALIA:16.2 Tahir to Mitchell Marsh, no run, full toss, a sufficiently high one which denies Marsh the room to free his arms, limply hits it back to Tahir
AUSTRALIA:16.1 Tahir to Mitchell Marsh, no run, watch the running! Finch is hurtling towards the striker's end but Marsh watches backward point swoop in on the ball and sends him backImran Tahir [2.0-0-9-0] is back into the attack
AUSTRALIA:15.6 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, FOUR, Finch gets low and sweeps, Duminy at fine leg does not a chance to stop this one
AUSTRALIA:15.5 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, was there some bat? Perhaps but de Kock did not think so. Huge appeal from him for lbw as Finch missed the sweep. Shamsi knew that there was some glove on it
AUSTRALIA:15.4 Tabraiz Shamsi to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, Marsh pats this delivery wide of mid-off for a single. FSL and slip in place
AUSTRALIA:15.3 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, 1 run, Finch sweeps again, does not connect well but gets a single to short fine leg
AUSTRALIA:15.2 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, 2 runs, Amla is not the most athletic but he should have caught it. Finch went for the sweep and top edged it towards Amla at short fine leg, who moved to his left but not quite swift enough to get under the ball
AUSTRALIA:15.1 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, tossed up outside off, Finch for the sweep but does not connect. Had his front leg outside off to save himselfShamsi has bowled beautifully but Phangiso has failed to give it enough air to cause some trouble for the batsmen. We are yet to see more of Tahir
AUSTRALIA:14.6 Phangiso to Mitchell Marsh, no run, pats this flatter ball with the turn towards the cover region
AUSTRALIA:14.5 Phangiso to Finch, 1 run, eases this one down towards long-on for a single
AUSTRALIA:14.4 Phangiso to Finch, SIX, solid blow, pretty solid. Finch just lofted this one with the turn. Note: with the turn, helped him clear long-off with ease
AUSTRALIA:14.3 Phangiso to Finch, no run, turn that beats Finch's forward defense outside off
AUSTRALIA:14.2 Phangiso to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, turn but short, Marsh cuts it to sweeper cover
AUSTRALIA:14.1 Phangiso to Finch, 1 run, Phangiso still has not got his length right. short enough for Finch to account for the turn and punch to long-off
AUSTRALIA:13.6 Tabraiz Shamsi to Mitchell Marsh, no run, not quite a googly but it went with the angle and eluded Marsh's bat outside off even as he tried to poke at it
AUSTRALIA:13.5 Tabraiz Shamsi to Mitchell Marsh, no run, tossed up delivery outside off, driven off the inner part of the bat, back to the bowler
AUSTRALIA:13.4 Tabraiz Shamsi to Mitchell Marsh, no run, another big appeal but this time the umpire makes the right decision. The ball had clearly pitched outside the leg stump
AUSTRALIA:13.3 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, 1 run, full toss has been swept to deep backward square leg
AUSTRALIA:13.2 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, big appeal, turned down. Turns it a big way to beat Finch's forward push, rapped on the pad but the umpire did not think it was hitting the stumps. It hit him in line and would have hit the middle stump. Replay confirmed
AUSTRALIA:13.1 Tabraiz Shamsi to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, backward short leg in place. Marsh pats it through cover point
AUSTRALIA:12.6 Phangiso to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, Marsh allows this one to turn and then pokes it to cover point for a single

AUSTRALIA:11.5 Tabraiz Shamsi to Maxwell, out Lbw!! Tell you what, this did not look that close. But Australia do not have a review left. First wickets in international cricket for Shamsi. Maxwell wanted to work it away but was beaten by a big turn. There was a huge appeal from the bowler and to everyone's surprise the umpire raised his finger. We have the replay confirmation, it was missing the leg stump Maxwell lbw b Tabraiz Shamsi 3(7)Tabraiz Shamsi to Maxwell, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!
AUSTRALIA:11.4 Tabraiz Shamsi to Maxwell, no run, too full again, Maxwell push-drives to mid-off. Finch wanted a single, it was not there
AUSTRALIA:11.3 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, 1 run, Finch gets his front foot across and works the full toss to long-on
AUSTRALIA:11.2 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, Finch gets his front foot across and wanted to defend it. The ball turned and hit him low on the pad, but it was doing too muchABD reviews it straightaway. How close was this? No problems with the front foot. No bat, hit in line. Is it doing too much? Wait for it... Umpire's call, it was hitting leg though
AUSTRALIA:11.1 Tabraiz Shamsi to Finch, no run, too full on the stumps, respectedTabraiz Shamsi, left-arm chinaman, comes into the attack

AUSTRALIA:9.4 Parnell to Finch, no run, length on the stumps, blocked
AUSTRALIA:9.3 Parnell to Finch, FOUR, here's the dessert! Finch drives this length ball on the up. It was in the air for a while, the cover fielder leapt but could not get his left hand to it
AUSTRALIA:9.2 Parnell to Finch, SIX, fow how long could Parnell stop Finch? Bowled a cutter that was full and Finch smacked it over long-on
AUSTRALIA:9.1 Parnell to Maxwell, 1 run, slower ball just on off, Maxwell runs it past a diving slip fielder. Third man comes into play
AUSTRALIA:8.6 Tahir to Finch, no run, shortish outside off, cut straight to the fielder at point

AUSTRALIA:8.2 Tahir to Finch, no run, full toss driven towards mid-on

AUSTRALIA:7.6 Parnell to Maxwell, no run, short of a good length on the stumps, blocked back to the bowlerGlenn Maxwell, right handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:7.5 Parnell to Smith, out Lbw!! What did "Fight Club" teach us? "Things you own, end up owning you." Smith gets across and plays those flicks so well, he can do them blindfolded. Not this time, misses this one as the ball angles in. Showed his leg-stump to the umpire, leaving no doubt that he was gone by all his money. Smith lbw b Parnell 8(10)Parnell to Smith, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Smith has gone upstairs but I am afraid it is not wise to review this one. Looked damn close. Front foot fine, hit in line. No bat, it has to just kiss the leg stump. Remember, it will be umpire's call. Yes, he is gone... Good enough, hitting leg. Captain is gone
AUSTRALIA:7.4 Parnell to Finch, leg byes, 1 run, Finch wants to work after getting across, gets it off his thighs towards fine leg

AUSTRALIA:5.6 Parnell to Smith, 1 run, Smith gets across his front foot and blocks the length delivery towards point
AUSTRALIA:5.5 Parnell to Finch, 1 run, Finch is not a good judge, as far as the singles are concerned. A direct hit at the bowler's end and he was gone, for the second time he got lucky.

AUSTRALIA:4.3 Rabada to Khawaja, out Bowled!! This is how you defend the fortress whose walls are not very high. Rabada bowls a full ball which curled in a a touch to beat Khawaja's cross batted push. South Africa have got rid of two left-handers at the top and guess who is laughing - Phangiso and even Tahir to some extent. Khawaja b Rabada 2(7)Rabada to Khawaja, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
AUSTRALIA:4.2 Rabada to Finch, 1 run, Finch adjusts on the front foot and runs it down to third man
AUSTRALIA:4.1 Rabada to Finch, FOUR, this guy does not need much space to pull. He showed it this time, was not that short and to make things tough, Finch was on the front foot. It did not matter much as he pulled it towards the cow corner for the ball to race away

AUSTRALIA:3.5 Parnell to Finch, 1 run, opens the bat on the push and sends it down to third man

AUSTRALIA:2.4 Rabada to Finch, no run, good length outside off, punched to cover
AUSTRALIA:2.3 Rabada to Finch, no run, timing here tougher than anything. Finch did not know perhaps and went for it on a fuller length, learnt his lessons soon
AUSTRALIA:2.2 Rabada to Finch, no run, this one kept low, pretty low. Finch was quick to get his bat down in time and flick towards mid-wicket
AUSTRALIA:2.1 Rabada to Finch, no run, three quarter length. Finch has to use evey inch of his height and get behind it to block
AUSTRALIA:1.6 Parnell to Khawaja, no run, shortish ball just outside off, Khawaja tries to pull, the ball scoots under his batReplays have proved that Warner was a goner there for all the right reasons. It would have been umpire's call, the ball was hitting leg
AUSTRALIA:1.5 Parnell to Khawaja, no run, short of a good length delivery, Khawaja defends it towards mid-onUsman Khawaja, left handed bat, comes to the crease
AUSTRALIA:1.4 Parnell to Warner, out Lbw!! What a ball to get rid of Warner. Parnell came from wide of the crease and got the ball to go with the angle. Remember the previous one he took away from Warner. This time the Aussie was on the back foot and was rapped on the back leg. My first thoughts were that it would slid down. But now you know why I was right to not choose umpiring as a career. Warner lbw b Parnell 1(5)Parnell to Warner, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Will Warner refer it? He won't

AUSTRALIA:0.1 Rabada to Warner, 1 run, back of a length delivery on the stumps of Warner, who tucks it to mid-wicketWarner and Finch are at the crease. Warner is on strike. Rabada will open the attackRabada has the ball. There is a slip in place[South Africa have got a score which once looked near impossible. Behardien's innings was pivotal and Australia will need just one, maybe two, such innings go past this one. Having said that, Phangiso and Tahir will not be a cake to feast uponOn a pitch that offered good turn for the spinners, the surprise star of the bowlers was Josh Hazlewood who discarded his usual style of play to keep it tight bowling wicket to wicket and bowled out with figures of 10-3-20-2. Farhan Behardien played one of his more important knocks as he walked out at a stage when his team were staring down the barrel at 104/5 in the 25th over. With Phangiso and Rabada providing good support, he maneuvered the strike to perfection and in the process brought up his sixth ODI half century and more importantly has given the Saf bowlers something to bowl at. Do join us shortly for the Australian reply.So once again, for the third time in a row in this series, the team batting first has failed to cross the 200-run mark. Blame it on the T20 hangover or the really sluggish track, the South African innings never seemed to get any sort of momentum as the Aussies bowlers kept pricking through regularly. After winning the toss and opting to bat first on a track that over the last week has garnered the reputation of being the Nagpur of the Caribbean, none of the batsmen could convert their starts into anything substantial.4
SOUTH AFRICA:49.6 Maxwell to Rabada, 1 run, a pacy ball which doesn't allow Rabada the time he needs on the mighty heave. Gets it high on the bat and mistimes it to mid-wicket. That's itTabraiz Shamsi, right handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:49.5 Maxwell to Tahir, out Caught by Coulter-Nile!! Taken at long-off. Maxwell picks his second as Tahir slices his attempted loft in the air. NCN swallows an easy offering.

SOUTH AFRICA:49.4 Maxwell to Behardien, out Bowled!! Gone this time. But what a brilliant effort. He's given the Proteas a fighting chance which is much more than what they had around 20 overs back. He tries to be a little too cute this time and premeditates a reverse-sweep. It's the absolute worst ball to try it to as Maxwell has fired it in the blockhole. Behardien gets nutmegged and is cleaned up. Behardien b Maxwell 62(82) [4s-4 6s-1]Maxwell to Behardien, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
SOUTH AFRICA:49.3 Maxwell to Behardien, 2 runs, fired away wide of off, Behardien throws everything he's got to carve it away but Maxwell has smartly bowled this pretty wide, Behardien skews it in the air off the toe-end. Couldn't have placed it better. It's between three converging men and they come back for two before long-off tidies up
SOUTH AFRICA:49.2 Maxwell to Behardien, 2 runs, loopy ball, a floater, and Behardien drives it straight of long-on for another couple
SOUTH AFRICA:49.1 Maxwell to Behardien, 2 runs, drifts this across off trying to get it out of Behardien's reach, it's not as wide as Maxwell wants but Behardien can't make a great connection either as he slots it wide of long-off. A coupleGlenn Maxwell [2.0-0-8-0] is back into the attackFinal over coming up. And the ball has been handed to Glenn Maxwell. Well!
SOUTH AFRICA:48.6 Mitchell Marsh to Behardien, 1 run, slower back of a length leg-cutter wide of off, Behardien is shuffling across looking to work it through the on-side but the ball holds its line, takes a soft leading edge and rolls away to extra-cover

SOUTH AFRICA:48.4 Mitchell Marsh to Rabada, 1 run, driven hard to long-off
SOUTH AFRICA:48.3 Mitchell Marsh to Behardien, 1 run, a helicopter followthrough with the bat as Behardien whips this down to long-on

SOUTH AFRICA:47.6 Zampa to Behardien, SIX, Behardien gets to his half-century by depositing a half-tracker into the mid-wicket stands. Brilliant rearguard effort and it comes from a man who is often criticized for not weighing in when he should
SOUTH AFRICA:47.5 Zampa to Behardien, no run, defended off the front foot
SOUTH AFRICA:47.4 Zampa to Rabada, 1 run, fires this one, it's in the blockhole just outside off but Rabada is still looking to blast it through the covers. Squirts it off the toe-end to short third man
SOUTH AFRICA:47.3 Zampa to Behardien, 1 run, shimmies down and drives to long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:47.3 Zampa to Behardien, wide, down the leg-side, bowler and keeper appeal to sway the umpire. That ain't happening
SOUTH AFRICA:47.2 Zampa to Rabada, 1 run, googly outside off, slightly short which allows Rabada to play it off the back foot and he steers it wide of short third man
SOUTH AFRICA:47.1 Zampa to Rabada, no run, a jaffa! It's a flipper which skids on from a length, Rabada is on the back foot when he should have been forward, he's also playing for some turn which isn't there and is beaten on the edge
SOUTH AFRICA:46.6 Mitchell Marsh to Rabada, 1 run, pushed down to long-off
SOUTH AFRICA:46.5 Mitchell Marsh to Behardien, 1 run, half-volley in line with the stumps, punched to long-on

SOUTH AFRICA:46.3 Mitchell Marsh to Behardien, no run, comes down the track, takes it on the full and drives it straight to cover
SOUTH AFRICA:46.2 Mitchell Marsh to Rabada, 1 run, and he gets away again. It's a short of length delivery angled in towards off from round the wicket, the ball sticks in the pitch and holds up on Rabada who checks his push but can't keep it down. It evades short-cover and drops in front of mid-off
SOUTH AFRICA:46.1 Mitchell Marsh to Rabada, no run, doesn't get up much from short of length outside off, scoots under Rabada's attempted cutMitchell Marsh [2.0-0-7-0] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:45.6 Zampa to Rabada, 1 run, reads the wrong 'un pretty early, goes deep in the crease and opens the bat-face to steer it wide of short third man. Not enough pace on the ball to race away from the fielder
SOUTH AFRICA:45.5 Zampa to Behardien, 1 run, decent use of the feet once more, driven to long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:45.4 Zampa to Rabada, 1 run, clipped with the turn through mid-wicket

SOUTH AFRICA:45.1 Zampa to Behardien, no run, flat and cramps Behardien for room as he backs away, also turns a little to catch a thick leading edge down the pitch
SOUTH AFRICA:44.6 Hazlewood to Rabada, 2 runs, Behardien must be pulling his hair off. Such a patient knock he's played and his lesser accomplished partners are all millionaires. Half-volley outside off, Rabada throws his bat looking to drive, the line is wide so he can't quite cover it and spoons it off the toe-end. Luckily it falls in the pocket behind extra-cover and to the right of mid-off
SOUTH AFRICA:44.5 Hazlewood to Rabada, no run, oh a big flourish of the bat, sees a half-volley and drives it straight to mid-off
SOUTH AFRICA:44.4 Hazlewood to Behardien, 1 run, slightly short outside off, cut away through the covers
SOUTH AFRICA:44.3 Hazlewood to Behardien, no run, back of a length delivery around middle and leg, tucked to short mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:44.2 Hazlewood to Behardien, no run, dropped by Hazlewood in his followthrough! Fraction full and Behardien punches it back in the air. It's at a comfortable height around the waist but Hazlewood panics. His hands are pretty shaky as he searches for the ball and ends up snatching at it. Pops out
SOUTH AFRICA:44.1 Hazlewood to Behardien, no run, back of a length outside off, chopped towards backward pointShamsi and Tahir are sitting side-by-side on the balcony, all padded up.
SOUTH AFRICA:43.6 Zampa to Rabada, no run, flipper, skids on rapidly outside off while keeping a touch low too, Rabada is defeated by the pace and is late on the cut, misses
SOUTH AFRICA:43.5 Zampa to Rabada, no run, defended with the turn back down the pitch
SOUTH AFRICA:43.4 Zampa to Rabada, no run, closes the bat-face a little too early but doesn't really jerk his wrists a great deal so the leading edge dribbles along the pitch
SOUTH AFRICA:43.3 Zampa to Behardien, 1 run, turning away outside off, cut to deep cover
SOUTH AFRICA:43.2 Zampa to Rabada, 1 run, pushed through on the pads, a little too short and Rabada comfortably tucks it through mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:43.1 Zampa to Behardien, 1 run, the length is pretty full to be back to, but Behardien has spent enough time out there. Drives it with the turn through the covers
SOUTH AFRICA:42.6 Hazlewood to Rabada, no run, stays stuck in the crease before tapping a back of a length delivery to mid-off. A maiden from Hazlewood
SOUTH AFRICA:42.5 Hazlewood to Rabada, no run, here's the low bounce which I've been talking about and it's scooted under Rabada's defence to hit the pad. But it's going down leg with the angle
SOUTH AFRICA:42.4 Hazlewood to Rabada, no run, short of length, tilted in towards leg, defended to leg
SOUTH AFRICA:42.3 Hazlewood to Rabada, no run, hangs back in the crease and blocks. I'll say it again, it's a risky tactic to not come forward given the variable bounce
SOUTH AFRICA:42.2 Hazlewood to Rabada, no run, almost an encore, easily done
SOUTH AFRICA:42.1 Hazlewood to Rabada, no run, fullish and angled in towards middle and leg from round the wicket, nudged into the on-sideJosh Hazlewood [8.0-2-17-2] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:41.6 Zampa to Rabada, 1 run, googly, skips away from back of a length on off, Rabada has plenty of time to pick it on the back foot and he knocks it through the cover region

SOUTH AFRICA:41.4 Zampa to Behardien, 1 run, opts to go on the back foot and punches it wide of coverKagiso Rabada, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:41.3 Zampa to Phangiso, out Caught by Hazlewood!! Oh dear! This is an absolute shocker from Phangiso. Behardien, at the other end, is quite prepared to go through the hard yards but Phangiso wants to go for the glory shot. Shimmies down the track and swings for the rafters with a slog across the line and against the turn, skies it off a thick leading edge and long-off just has a few yards to move forward to gobble it up. You have to go it to Zampa too, suckered the lower order batsman in with some delicious flight. Phangiso c Hazlewood b Zampa 9(41)Zampa to Phangiso, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!
SOUTH AFRICA:41.2 Zampa to Phangiso, no run, loopy half-volley around off, drilled to mid-on
SOUTH AFRICA:41.1 Zampa to Behardien, 1 run, shuffles towards off while bending his knees and paddles it through the short fine leg regionAdam Zampa [6.0-0-26-0] is back into the attackIt's been hard work. But Behardien's effort is admirable. Nine more overs to go, South Africa will take whatever they can get
SOUTH AFRICA:40.6 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, 1 run, strays on the pads once more, Behardien happily glances down to fine leg to retain strike
SOUTH AFRICA:40.5 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, this one is overcompensated by slanting it into the pads, clipped to short mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:40.4 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, FOUR, a loud grunt in anguish from NCN. It's a poor ball which is laced with width outside off. Behardien recognizes the opportunity and smears it through the point region
SOUTH AFRICA:40.3 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, gently drives a full ball to mid-off
SOUTH AFRICA:40.2 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, length ball just outside off, defended
SOUTH AFRICA:40.1 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, where is Phangiso going? Don't tell me he is thinking of taking strike with 5 balls left. Driven straight to mid-off and he is already quite some steps down the pitch, before being sent back by a surprised Behardien
SOUTH AFRICA:39.6 Lyon to Behardien, 1 run, glanced with the turn to long leg
SOUTH AFRICA:39.5 Lyon to Behardien, no run, not enough back-spin on the ball to make it roll back on the stumps. Behardien has offered a pretty flimsy back foot defence and drops it at his feet. To be fair, the ball wasn't in line with the stumps anyway as Behardien has played it outside leg
SOUTH AFRICA:39.4 Lyon to Behardien, no run, drifts this across off, Behardien defends off the front foot
SOUTH AFRICA:39.3 Lyon to Behardien, no run, shimmies down and flicks it to short mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:39.2 Lyon to Phangiso, 1 run, flat on middle and leg from round the wicket, Phangiso works it with the turn to long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:39.1 Lyon to Behardien, 1 run, backs away - more of a hop at the last moment to free up some room before late-cutting wide of backward pointNathan Lyon [9.0-0-37-1] is back into the attackIt's very humdrum out there. You'd see more action in a library. But South Africa's (and Behardien's) approach is understandable given the situation they are in. Australia aren't shying away from attacking either.
SOUTH AFRICA:38.6 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, 1 run, rides the bounce on this short of length delivery and glides it down to third man
SOUTH AFRICA:38.5 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, 1 run, tucked away off the hips, gets it past a diving backward square leg for a single
SOUTH AFRICA:38.4 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, no run, the cover-drive is played slightly early as Phangiso is reaching for the full ball away from the body due to which it is in the air for a brief while. But he's done well to check his bat-speed on impact and it drops well short of the fielder
SOUTH AFRICA:38.3 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, no run, fraction fuller than a good length but shorter than a half-volley, defended back to the bowler after getting forward
SOUTH AFRICA:38.2 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, no run, picks a length ball from middle and clips to short mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:38.1 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, no run, on a good length outside off, Phangiso angles it to backward point
SOUTH AFRICA:37.6 Zampa to Phangiso, 1 run, shortish and turning away outside off, Phangiso camps back and cuts to sweeper cover
SOUTH AFRICA:37.5 Zampa to Phangiso, no run, ugh, Phangiso gets himself into a little tangle with this. He gets a little too side-on against a near-yorker at his feet, somehow keeps it out
SOUTH AFRICA:37.4 Zampa to Phangiso, no run, overpitched just outside off, driven to cover
SOUTH AFRICA:37.3 Zampa to Phangiso, no run, good loop this. He got the ball to land outside the defensive reach of Phangiso but the turn isn't alarming which allows the batsman to keep it out
SOUTH AFRICA:37.2 Zampa to Phangiso, no run, turns away from a back of a length from off, punched to cover
SOUTH AFRICA:37.1 Zampa to Phangiso, no run, good stride forward which allows Phangiso to get within reach of the pitch of the leg-break and smother it down
SOUTH AFRICA:36.6 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, skiddy back of a length delivery, Behardien is a bit tardy in getting his bat down but does so in the nick of time to chop it at the popping crease
SOUTH AFRICA:36.5 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, full ball, Behardien checks his push to cover
SOUTH AFRICA:36.4 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, 1 run, Phangiso doesn't move his feet much in defence and a thick inside edge runs away to fine leg
SOUTH AFRICA:36.3 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, 1 run, good run. Length ball just outside off, Behardien knocks it in front of mid-off, knew how softly he had hit it and called for the single straightaway
SOUTH AFRICA:36.2 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, dips back in slightly towards off, the fullish length convinces Behardien to wade forward and he pushes it back to the bowler. Wanted to go more towards mid-off but the bat-face closed on impact
SOUTH AFRICA:36.1 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, bumper in line with the stumps, Behardien wants nothing to do with it and ducks underneath
SOUTH AFRICA:35.6 Zampa to Phangiso, no run, it's a very very ambitious review from the Aussies. Wonder who convinced Smith to go for it. Zampa drifts this one towards leg-stump, the ball pitches in line but doesn't turn enough before hitting Phangiso on the pad. Easily sliding down leg
SOUTH AFRICA:35.5 Zampa to Behardien, 1 run, shimmies down, gets to the ball and drives to long-off
SOUTH AFRICA:35.4 Zampa to Behardien, no run, this is an absolute ripper! Can't play these. It turns at pace and beats Behardien's flat-footed cover-drive
SOUTH AFRICA:35.3 Zampa to Behardien, no run, well flighted leg-break, a little too full again though, jammed to short cover
SOUTH AFRICA:35.2 Zampa to Phangiso, 1 run, flatter trajectory, the length is very full just outside off which lures him into an off-drive but he plays down the wrong line. Gets a thick outside edge which rolls towards short third man
SOUTH AFRICA:35.1 Zampa to Phangiso, no run, Phangiso shuffles to the leg-side to make room and punches a leg-break from around off-stump to cover
SOUTH AFRICA:34.6 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, Behardien is hesitant to get forward this time, it's a length ball around middle and he blocks it on the move back down the pitch
SOUTH AFRICA:34.5 Coulter-Nile to Behardien, no run, defensively nudged off the pads to short mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:34.4 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, 1 run, shortish outside off, Phangiso climbs on his toes and dabs it behind backward point
SOUTH AFRICA:34.3 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, no run, short of length delivery around the rib-cage, tucked softly to backward square who is close in
SOUTH AFRICA:34.2 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, no run, oh risky. Very risky. With the bounce as unpredictable as it is, Phangiso is stuck on the crease to a good length delivery. The ball skids on, keeps a touch low too and he somehow manages to get his bat down in time
SOUTH AFRICA:34.1 Coulter-Nile to Phangiso, no run, good solid forward defence. It would have injected a little more trust in Behardien watching from the non-striker'sNathan Coulter-Nile [6.0-2-28-2] is back into the attackDrinks are on the field now! South Africa are in the mire, but think of it this way - what a golden opportunity for Behardien to make a notable contribution. Every batsman worth his salt yearns to make THE TOUGH RUNS. But for that, he needs Phangiso to stick around.
SOUTH AFRICA:33.6 Zampa to Behardien, no run, loops it up on off, Behardien prods forward, can't quite reach out to the pitch as the ball dips on him so he waits for it to turn and then defends
SOUTH AFRICA:33.5 Zampa to Behardien, 2 runs, drops it slightly short outside off and is cut away through the point region - although not very well timed. Sweeper cover has enough ground to cover to lure the batsmen into a second
SOUTH AFRICA:33.4 Zampa to Behardien, no run, another pacy delivery, no intention to turn the ball, defended into the leg-side
SOUTH AFRICA:33.3 Zampa to Behardien, no run, darts it on a length, slides on towards off before being blocked
SOUTH AFRICA:33.2 Zampa to Behardien, no run, quicker, still short, but the ball skids on to Behardien as he is trying to pull. Mistimes it to short mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:33.1 Zampa to Behardien, FOUR, Behardien's eyes light up on seeing a half-tracker. This is the stuff which he can't let go unpunished. Jumps back and wallops the pull wide of long-on. One bounce and over the ropesAdam Zampa [3.0-0-17-0] is back into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:32.6 Hazlewood to Phangiso, no run, sees width and flashes late, straight to backward point
SOUTH AFRICA:32.5 Hazlewood to Phangiso, no run, as the mizzle drizzle continues to ring around Phangiso too continues to stick around with some compact defences
SOUTH AFRICA:32.4 Hazlewood to Phangiso, no run, plonks forward and blocks
SOUTH AFRICA:32.3 Hazlewood to Behardien, 1 run, that's one way of getting runs, the overthrows I meant. Behardien plays this to mid-on and the duo were hesitant in stealing a single, Zampa's needless throw and Guyana's awkward bounce meant Wade couldn't gather it cleanly. One run is a gold dust at the moment...
SOUTH AFRICA:32.2 Hazlewood to Phangiso, 1 run, keeps Phangiso on his toes by bowling short and into him, hops and tickles it down to fine legYep! It's drizzling now...
SOUTH AFRICA:32.1 Hazlewood to Phangiso, no run, touch fuller outside off, Phangiso swishes with a flat-bat and the lack of bounce meant it went past his under edgeThere's a deep FSL in place to spice things up

SOUTH AFRICA:30.4 Hazlewood to Phangiso, no run, where's that off-stump? If that ball ever had a chance to voice its opinion, that would be the query, Phangiso says "No, I'm not letting you go past me" (Pun intended)

SOUTH AFRICA:28.2 Hazlewood to Parnell, out Bowled!! Crikey! Someone save that off-stump please, has taken a lot of beating in the last 6 overs. The Aussie pacers continue to rock the timber. Relatively similar to Duminy's dismissal - From round the wicket, angled in and straightened a touch to knock Parnell's off-stump.

SOUTH AFRICA:24.6 Coulter-Nile to Duminy, out Bowled!! Whoa! There's a love affair going around between Coulter-Nile and off-stump. Two in two, first ABD and now JPD. He switches to round the wicket and creates the angle that normally tempts left-handers. Bowls a seam-up delivery that landed just outside off stump. Straightened slightly and left JPD clueless as he ends up playing all around it. Looks to grope sans any feet movement and sees his off-pole fly after turning over. Top-nut! Duminy b Coulter-Nile 13(22)Coulter-Nile to Duminy, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!
SOUTH AFRICA:24.5 Coulter-Nile to Duminy, no run, this fullish delivery tailed back in slightly, yet again Duminy chases flat-footed and this time he gets an under edge towards the keeper

SOUTH AFRICA:22.1 Coulter-Nile to de Villiers, out Bowled!! Woof! I didn't see that coming, against the run of play! I'm still rubbing my eyes in disbelief. The wicket ain't as dramatic as it sounds but Coulter-Nile somehow managed to nip out the danger man. UNDONE BY THE LACK OF BOUNCE. Maybe ABD was a little too causal in his approach, a fullish length off-cutter that landed around fifth stump line and scissored back in sharply to puzzle AB who was trying to dab it to third man. Ends up playing all around it and lets his off-stump go for a walk. Was a smidge late to bring his bat down too. Game on! de Villiers b Coulter-Nile 22(38)Coulter-Nile to de Villiers, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Nathan Coulter-Nile [3.0-0-25-0] is back into the attack

SOUTH AFRICA:18.2 Finch to de Villiers, 1 run, eased down to long-offJean-Paul Duminy, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:18.1 Finch to de Villiers, out Amla Run Out!! You never want to get run out as a batsman, that hurts and hurts very badly. Hurts you even more when you are the non-striker. Oh, Hashim Amla! AB crunched this to the left of Steven Smith at short cover. Amla was a bit too casual, perhaps anticipated it will go past the Aussie skip. Not to be, Smithy dives - Grabs one-handed and senses an opportunity at the bowler's end. Amla was nearly half-way down and was never gonna get there, Finchy completes the formalities. Amla run out (Smith/Finch) 35(46) [4s-2]Finch to de Villiers, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!

SOUTH AFRICA:17.2 Mitchell Marsh to de Villiers, 1 run, asks AB to show one of his punch strokes by bowling a back of a length outside off, AB obliges and silks one through cover
SOUTH AFRICA:17.1 Mitchell Marsh to Amla, 1 run, drifts one into Amla's pads, he'll eat that all day, flicked away for a single through mid-wicketDrinks are on the field now. Yes, it's S-P-I-N-N-I-N-G but South Africa have done well so far. Anywhere around 220 will be a good score I reckon...Here's the Junior Marsh

SOUTH AFRICA:15.5 Mitchell Marsh to Amla, 1 run, steers the length ball with an open blade towards third man
SOUTH AFRICA:15.4 Mitchell Marsh to Amla, no run, not everyone is ABD and de Villiers needs to be aware of it. He half ran this one before Amla stopped him after tucking in front of short mid-wicket. A direct hit, well cannot say if that would have been close
SOUTH AFRICA:15.3 Mitchell Marsh to de Villiers, 1 run, watching the ball late was the key here as de Villiers adjusted well even as the ball kept low from a length outside off, dabbed to third man
SOUTH AFRICA:15.2 Mitchell Marsh to de Villiers, no run, Marsh has cut the length by a foot this time, forcing de Villiers to push it back
SOUTH AFRICA:15.1 Mitchell Marsh to Amla, 1 run, fuller than a half-volley, shorter than a yorker, outside off. Amla drives off the front foot, squeezes the drive in fact towards sweeperMitchell Marsh, right-arm medium, comes into the attackMitchell Marsh is here

SOUTH AFRICA:13.5 Lyon to Amla, 1 run, touch short and Amla punch-drives it to sweeper cover
SOUTH AFRICA:13.4 Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run, sounds of "catch it" directed at the man at leg slip. But de Villiers was well in control as he turned it with the turn towards deep backward square leg

SOUTH AFRICA:13.2 Lyon to Amla, FOUR, well tossed up and Amla is happy to see it. Gets a big stride forward and drives to beat a diving extra c over
SOUTH AFRICA:13.1 Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run, leg slip in place. de Villiers has time to wait and work it through mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:12.6 Zampa to de Villiers, 1 run, the title of 360 degree is not a farce, saw this one slipping down the leg-side and turned quickly to pat it behind, did not time that well but a single to backward square leg was going nowhere
SOUTH AFRICA:12.5 Zampa to Amla, 1 run, good line from Zampa, Amla drives with the turn towards sweeper cover for a single
SOUTH AFRICA:12.5 Zampa to Amla, wide, slips this one down the leg-side, wide called

SOUTH AFRICA:12.2 Zampa to de Villiers, 2 runs, overcooked the flight and de Villiers drove it wide of sweeper cover for a couple of runs. de Villiers ran this one well to make two out of one and a halfSlip in place
SOUTH AFRICA:12.1 Zampa to Amla, 1 run, short and turning away, harmless. Amla gets back in his crease and works to mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:11.6 Lyon to de Villiers, no run, big appeal and I thought it was close. But the umpire was unmoved, maybe it would have slid down, will see the replays. Flighted delivery which de Villiers failed to nudge away after getting his front foot across the line
SOUTH AFRICA:11.5 Lyon to de Villiers, no run, tossed up, only so little. de Villiers blocks back

SOUTH AFRICA:11.3 Lyon to de Villiers, 1 run, de Villiers gets his front foot across and works it wide of long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:11.2 Lyon to de Villiers, no run, de Villiers does not allow the spinners to get their footing right. He uses his feet and pads the ball after seeing that he was not there to the pitch of it
SOUTH AFRICA:11.1 Lyon to Amla, 1 run, there is a leg-slip but not this kind of length, which allowed Amla to wait and punch it to long-on
SOUTH AFRICA:10.6 Zampa to de Villiers, no run, slower through the air again, de Villiers gently pushes it short extra
SOUTH AFRICA:10.5 Zampa to de Villiers, 2 runs, short and slower than what I am on treadmill. de Villiers cuts it through extra cover for a couple
SOUTH AFRICA:10.4 Zampa to Amla, 1 run, did not get the lap right but got it in the gap at square leg, Smith wanted to ran him out at the bowler's end but Amla was well in. In fact, he overran, else he could have taken an overthrow as well
SOUTH AFRICA:10.3 Zampa to Amla, 2 runs, cute from Amla, who gets pretty low and takes it on the full to lap it past short fine
SOUTH AFRICA:10.2 Zampa to Amla, no run, a touch fuller this time but not a cause of concern for Amla who pushes it back
SOUTH AFRICA:10.1 Zampa to Amla, no run, problem with the length and leg-spinners were part of the same womb. Shortish and Amla punches it towards mid-offAdam Zampa, right-arm leg break, comes into the attac

SOUTH AFRICA:9.5 Lyon to Rossouw, out Lbw!! The idea from Lyon was simple, he turned a few away from Rossouw and created doubt in his mind before bowling this one straight with the arm. Rossouw, even though, well forward could not get his bat in the line of the delivery and was struck well below the knee roll. The umpire did not hesitant a bit befoe sinking Rossouw's ship, all with a raised finger. Rossouw lbw b Lyon 7(11) [4s-1]Lyon to Rossouw, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Rossouw did not even think for a second and reviewed it. Looked pretty close and I think the umpire has made a right lbw call. He has not hit it, is hit in line and the ball is clipping the top of off. What has he done, wasted a review as well. The decision stays
SOUTH AFRICA:9.4 Lyon to Rossouw, no run, this one skid off the surface but Rossouw was ready to turn it towards square leg
SOUTH AFRICA:9.3 Lyon to Amla, 1 run, too full and Amla drives at it, cannot beat a diving mid-off but will have a single
SOUTH AFRICA:9.2 Lyon to Rossouw, 1 run, Rossouw tries to defend this turner, gets it of the outer part of the bat that rolls past second slip for a singleTwo slips in place

SOUTH AFRICA:8.3 Hazlewood to Amla, 1 run, Amla swivels across and clips it to the left of fine leg. We saw how de Kock perished to a similar shot, Amla will have to be careful every time he attempts such shots
SOUTH AFRICA:8.3 Hazlewood to Amla, wide, very wide outside off, Amla went chasing at it, did not connect but a run on offer anyway
SOUTH AFRICA:8.2 Hazlewood to Rossouw, 1 run, cutter perhaps. The line was outside off and it allowed Rossouw to dab it to third man for a single

SOUTH AFRICA:6.6 Hazlewood to Rossouw, no run, Hazlewood sticks to the same length but he corrected the line this time and bowled it closer to Rossouw. He had no choice but to defend it back

SOUTH AFRICA:6.4 Hazlewood to Rossouw, no run, slip in place for the new man, who misitmes the on-drive on the length delivery towards the on-sideRilee Rossouw, left handed bat, comes to the crease
SOUTH AFRICA:6.3 Hazlewood to de Kock, out Lbw!! Hazlewood comes round the wicket and gets the length right. de Kock once again got across, like had been doing for a while, but this time missed the flick. The ball hit his front pad and then brushed the back leg, creating doubt in the umpire's mind regarding an inside edge. It was not there and the decision was overruled. de Kock lbw b Hazlewood 18(23) [4s-2 6s-1]Hazlewood to de Kock, THAT'S OUT!! Lbw!!Smith has decided to challenge the onfield call. He has trusted his keeper, let's see whether Wade is right. Front foot is fine, the commentator thinks there were two noises, I could not agree more. Sound might be because of the ball brushing the back pad before hitting the front one. But the question is, is there an inside edge? Tough to tell from here. Impact in line, wickets hitting... Original decision has been overturned. Wade deserves some credit for that, he was blinded but judged it well to convince his captain
SOUTH AFRICA:6.2 Hazlewood to de Kock, no run, de Kock gets across and uses the angle from round the wicket to flick it well. Was unlucky that picked out the man in the ring at fine leg
SOUTH AFRICA:6.1 Hazlewood to Amla, 1 run, Amla waits for the length delivery and works it to square leg, good call by de Kock and a single ensues
SOUTH AFRICA:5.6 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, FOUR, intentional? Yes, de Kock cuts this one off the top edge and sees it fly past the keeper like a honeybee done with extracting the nectar
SOUTH AFRICA:5.5 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, no run, back of a length delivery and de Kock is lucky that he did not drop it on the stumps. Played it quite late and was in danger of the ball rolling back
SOUTH AFRICA:5.4 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, SIX, I wonder what is it? Frustration for not timing those or just instinct. Whatever it is, looked great. de Kock got his front foot across and launched the length ball over the cow corner for a maximum
SOUTH AFRICA:5.3 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, no run, de Kock is coming from India where the ball comes to you as quickly as anything. Once again he is left wanting for pace as he pushes the length delivery towards cover
SOUTH AFRICA:5.2 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, no run, back of a length delivery from round the wicket for de Kock, who tucks it to mid-wicket
SOUTH AFRICA:5.1 Coulter-Nile to Amla, 1 run, wait, get a horizontal blade and guide it to third man. Sounds easy, right?
SOUTH AFRICA:5.1 Coulter-Nile to Amla, wide, Coulter-Nile misses the line and hurls it down the leg-side, wided
SOUTH AFRICA:4.6 Hazlewood to Amla, leg byes, 1 run, this is what dull pitches do. Amla wanted to manufacture a shot by moving across the line of the delivery trying to whip it across. Was lucky that he got himself outside the line of stump when the ball struck his pad. That helped his evade the appeal, which was pretty loud by any standard
SOUTH AFRICA:4.5 Hazlewood to Amla, no run, this is the kind of pitch where you will need two driving licenses to drive on the up. Oh forget it. Length ball and Amla mistimes the punch to short cover
SOUTH AFRICA:4.4 Hazlewood to de Kock, 1 run, we will see a lot of those as the game progresses. de Kock opens the blade and runs it down to third man
SOUTH AFRICA:4.3 Hazlewood to de Kock, no run, de Kock wanted to go for the square drive but could not much due to the lack of pace, mistimed it on the pitch towards short cover
SOUTH AFRICA:4.2 Hazlewood to de Kock, no run, nicely forward is de Kock as he blocks the length from Hazlewood back to him
SOUTH AFRICA:4.1 Hazlewood to de Kock, no run, again a sign of ball holding on the pitch, de Kock has to wait for it before he decides to defend to backward point
SOUTH AFRICA:3.6 Coulter-Nile to Amla, no run, this one made a nice sound off the bat, but was not there in the gap. Amla got his bat straight and push-drove the length delivery to mid-on
SOUTH AFRICA:3.5 Coulter-Nile to Amla, no run, Coulter-Nile sticks to the length delivery, Amla pushes it towards the mid-on region
SOUTH AFRICA:3.4 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, 1 run, they are wise enough to not take on the arm of Warner. de Kock pushes the length ball past the bowler, Warner from mid-off runs and gets to it in time to keep de Kock down to one
SOUTH AFRICA:3.3 Coulter-Nile to Amla, 1 run, easily done again. Amla waited and then guided the back of a length to third man for a single
SOUTH AFRICA:3.2 Coulter-Nile to Amla, no run, similar delivery but the width was not there, Amla was on his toes again. Punched it to cover
SOUTH AFRICA:3.1 Coulter-Nile to Amla, FOUR, wow. Now we are talking. Shortish ball outside off and Amla gets tall and rolls his wrists on the cut to place the cut past backward point
SOUTH AFRICA:3.1 Coulter-Nile to Amla, wide, stfled appeal for a strangle down the leg-side from a few men out there. But there was nothing on it to get the umpire interested. Wide called
SOUTH AFRICA:2.6 Hazlewood to de Kock, no run, back of a length delivery angled into the left-hander, who gets tall and tucks to mid-on
SOUTH AFRICA:2.5 Hazlewood to de Kock, no run, slightly shorter than the previous delivery and de Kock is happy to get behind the line of the delivery to guard it out
SOUTH AFRICA:2.4 Hazlewood to de Kock, no run, round the wicket comes Hazlewood and keeps it around off and middle, de Kock presents the full face of the bat and pats it to mid-off. Once again de Kock waited for the delivery to come to him
SOUTH AFRICA:2.3 Hazlewood to de Kock, no run, right on the money, on the stumps. de Kock gets across and works to mid-wicket, no run there for him
SOUTH AFRICA:2.2 Hazlewood to de Kock, no run, in around that off stump from Hazlewood, de Kock firmly punches towards mid-on
SOUTH AFRICA:2.1 Hazlewood to Amla, 1 run, Amla waits for the length delivery and then steers it to third man for an easy singleComing to the lbw appeal against Amla, the ball would have clipped the leg stump. However, umpire's call would have prevailed so as said earlier, wise from Smithy to not go upstairs
SOUTH AFRICA:1.6 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, 2 runs, back of a length from Coulter-Nile allows de Kock to get across and work it through mid-wicket for a couple of runs
SOUTH AFRICA:1.5 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, no run, that fielder at short mid-off is playing on de Kock's mind. He did not go for the drive this time, allowed the ball to approach him and blockedShort mid-off in place
SOUTH AFRICA:1.4 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, no run, that is a pacy delivery angled across de Kock, who almost poked at it. Lucky that he did not edged it
SOUTH AFRICA:1.3 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, FOUR, this is better from de Kock. He did not commit on the drive and punched this length delivery past the bowler, mid-off was a mere spectator
SOUTH AFRICA:1.2 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, no run, lack of pace on this slanted delivery outside off, de Kock wanted to drive it through the cover region, did not time it well and got an inside edge onto the pads
SOUTH AFRICA:1.1 Coulter-Nile to de Kock, no run, Coulter-Nile has kept this one pretty full outside off, de Kock is not afraid to get his front foot in line and push-drive it to mid-offNathan Coulter-Nile, right-arm fast, comes into the attack
SOUTH AFRICA:0.6 Hazlewood to Amla, no run, the pitch is not playing that great. Once again Amla struggles for timing as he drives this length ball straight to the fielder at mid-off
SOUTH AFRICA:0.5 Hazlewood to Amla, no run, fuller length delivery outside off, Amla gets his front foot in line and drives to mid-off
SOUTH AFRICA:0.4 Hazlewood to Amla, no run, big appeal for an lbw. The umpire does not budge though. Amla was on the back foot, trying to work it around the corner, the ball kept a bit low and struck him just below the knee roll. The angle might have taken it down the leg-side, so it was prudent from Smith to not go upstairs
SOUTH AFRICA:0.3 Hazlewood to Amla, no run, lack of bounce on that occasion from Hazlewood, the length was just outside off. Amla does not budge once again
SOUTH AFRICA:0.2 Hazlewood to Amla, no run, shapes this one into from a length. Amla gets his front foot in line of the delivery and blocks it
SOUTH AFRICA:0.1 Hazlewood to Amla, no run, good length delivery just outside off, Amla lets it goAmla and de Kock are at the crease. Amla is on strike. Hazlewood will open the attackThe players are out there. Hazlewood has the ball in his hand, there is a slip in placeFolks, just a while ago, Cricket South Africa tweeted that Morris has been rested and Rabada is playing. Guess, ABD is not very good with memorizing the final XI. At least, there is something he cannot do. Also it's quite perplexing to know that Starc has been given a rest just after one game. Remember, he's coming back after an injury break...Teams:South Africa (Playing XI): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Wayne Parnell, Aaron Phangiso, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Tabraiz ShamsiAustralia (Playing XI): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith(c), Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), Adam Zampa, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan LyonSmith: "It's been good (his friendship with AB), he's a great man and a terrific player. You always want to go out there and win. South Africa are a quality side. Looks dry, we would have batted too. Dare I say that it will take spin, hopefully we can adapt well and have a good game. Starc is having a rest today, NCN gets his opportunity. Our spinners were brilliant in the previous game, first time in an Australian team that two spinners took seven wickets between them, but it's about starting fresh today."AB: "We'll bat first. We played on a dry and slow wicket, need to apply a bit better. Always annoying to lose games of cricket. But it's a different game, and against a fantastic team in Australia. Two changes for us, Parnell and Shamsi will get a go. We got a very balanced team, no excuses for the previous match as we had our opportunities but threw them away. We love dealing with our backs against the wall. Great opportunity before heading to St. Kitts."South Africa have won the toss and have opted to batAustralia look mighty, when do they not? No seriously, they seem to have all facets covered and especially after watching their spinners strangling West Indies in a straitjacket, it makes them a superlative force. So, how important is the toss? Bat first probably? Let's see...The Proteas aren't really known to be friends with slow, sluggish tracks. But if they are expecting something different, then I'm afraid it doesn't look very likely. One source of solace is that there won't be any Sunil Narine to unleash armageddon on their lesser-experience lower middle order. Lyon and Zampa may have something to say about that though. Bowling looked alright with Tahir and Phangiso apparently reveling against West Indies on a tired surface.12:05 Local Time, 16:05 GMT, 21:35 IST: Hello all, and welcome to the third match of the tri-series. It's the big one. South Africa take on Australia with a chance to bring parity to the points table. But there's the flip side of the coin too - lose this and the road to be in the hunt becomes all the more strewn with thorns. Such is the format of the series that there is no scope to have a bad game. And South Africa had a horror outing against the hosts, forget bad. Anyway, it's a new day and there's something about this fixture that tugs at every cricket fan's strings owing to the history between these two teams.Preview:After their mauling at the hands of West Indies, South Africa would be keen to sort out their woes against spin, while Australia would want Nathan Lyon and Adam Zampa to continue from where they left off against the hosts a couple of days ago as the two teams lock horns at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Tuesday (June 7), in the third One-Day International of the ongoing tri-series.A couple of comeback stories were scripted in the first two games of the tournament. If Sunil Narine and Kieron Pollard stole the limelight in the opener, Mitchell Starc put up an impressive show on Sunday on his return to national duty after being sidelined for over six months due to an ankle injury.In the series opener against the hosts, South Africa did begin on a positive note, but lost the plot completely as the ball got old. Quinton de Kock, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and Jean Paul Duminy, all failed to convert their starts as mystery spinner Narine ran though their batting order to register his career-best figures of six for 27.The positive for them, though, was the batting of Rilee Rossouw, who fought hard and made 61, and the bowling of spinners Aaron Phangiso and Imran Tahir, who are expected to play a key role come Tuesday.On the other hand, Australia did not have to sweat muchon Sundayfor their six-wicket win. With assistance from the surface, both Lyon and Zampa made the batsmen dance to their tunes as they shared six wickets between them.With the target being very small, David Warner came out positively and looked as ominous with the bat once again as he was during the recently concluded Indian Premier League. Although the scorecard tells that Australia lost four wickets in their chase, the victory looked much more convincing to the naked eye.Even as the two teams look closely-matched on paper, the fact that Starc is back at full throttle and the ball is coming out nicely off leg-spinner Adam Zampa's hands gives world champions Australia a slight edge.When: Australia vs South Africa, 3nd Match, Tri-series on June 7 at 1:00 PM Local Time, 10:30 PM ISTWhere: Providence Stadium, GuyanaWhat to expect: The pitch is expected to be no different to the first two games, with the slower bowlers getting ample assistance. This also means that the abrasive ball could aid a skillful fast bowler at the death in the form of reverse swing.Weather-wise, a few passing showers with sunny spells are predicted for the day.Team NewsAustralia: Barring last minute injuries, Australia are unlikely to tinker with their winning combination.South Africa: The Proteas wait for a fitness certificate of Faf du Plessis, who is yet to recover fully from a finger injury. His presence would boost the batting line-up and his return could mean that one of Rilee Rossouw or Farhaan Behradien could face the axe. Having top-scored for his side in the last game, the former puts himself slightly ahead.Who said what"It was really tough. We expected a bit of a sub-continent surface and that is exactly what we got. It was difficult to hit the ball off the square and to rotate the strike. Myself and AB (De Villiers) needed to find a way to build the partnership without any high risk shots. We have a fairly good idea of how the surface will play, so hopefully the guys will settle in and make a big play for us tomorrow," said an upbeatRilee Rossouw, on the eve of the game."We know what South Africa bring. They have some superstars and it is going to be a great challenge. We have to rock up and perform well, compete in all three areas and really have a good game. We like to challenge ourselves as Australian cricketers. We want to play against one of the best sides in the world. So we are looking forward to that game,"Nathan Lyon said after Australia's winning start.Teams:South Africa (From): Quinton de Kock(w), Hashim Amla, Rilee Rossouw, AB de Villiers(c), Jean-Paul Duminy, Farhaan Behardien, Chris Morris, Kyle Abbott, Aaron Phangiso, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Faf du Plessis, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Tabraiz Shamsi, S KatwarooAustralia (From): David Warner, Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith(c), Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Marsh, Matthew Wade(w), Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon, George Bailey, Nathan Coulter-Nile, James Faulkner, Travis HeadLATEST NEWSZouks look to build on home momentum1h agoEx-cricketers set to benefit from reforms3h agoMathew & Co will have to move out of KCA4h agoKSCA postpones AGM, polls4h agoR Ashwin - twice the asset, twice as dangerous5h agoMore News.cb-topic-header{margin-left:0px!important;}
